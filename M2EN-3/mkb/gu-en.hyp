Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Deepawali.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destructs the opposite intellect and shows the intellect.
My salutations to such a Divya Yojana, what could be a better idea than this to remember this Deepawali, to spread the light, to spread positivity and to wipe out the feeling of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is involved in it, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens of that country and the social organisations of that country also celebrate the festival of Diwali with full joy.
In a way, India stands there.
Friends, Festival tourism is also an attraction of its own in the world.
There are immense possibilities of festivals that our country is a country of festivals.
Our effort should be to spread such festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and also to include people from other states and other countries in the joy of festivals.
There are several festivals of each and every state in our region, people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in Gai Mann Ki Baat that this Diwali will do something different.
Let us all celebrate India's women power and achievements, i. e.
And immediately thereafter, a number of inspiring stories on social media came to light.
The Kodipaka of Warangal has written on Namo App that my mother is my strength.
Ever since my father died in 10th century, my mother took up the responsibility of our five daughters.
Today we are in the good business of five brothers.
My mother is God for me.
It is universal for me and it is India's Laxmi in the true sense.
My greetings to your mother, Ramesh Ji.
Deepika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says, For her, Major Khushbu Kanwar is Lakshmi of India, the daughter of a bus conductor.
Laxmi of India is her daughter for poetry.
He is proud that his daughter makes beautiful paintings.
He has won a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
Medha Jain ji has also written that for an old woman of 2 years, she has been drinking water free of cost to travellers on Gwalior Railway Station.
Mehta Ji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
So many stories have been shared by people.
You must read, get inspiration and share yourself if you have such an inspiring story around you.
I also salute all these Laxmis of India.
It seems as if the foundation stone was laid in the 17th century itself.
This poem contains so many beautiful words, so many good feelings and so many wonderful thoughts.
Panininda Permegondnu Himavantu, Panininda Bhrigu Perchidanupaninda Janakarayanu Jaswadenuarth, Himavant i.e., due to her daughter Parvati, the Bhrigu Shekhar obtained fame due to her daughter Laxmi and the king's daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and it is because of the greatness of these daughters that our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th November, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the ancient world.
In some countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters reside, who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you about, but for that I should bind my heart in many ways.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji conveyed his message to far-off places in the world.
He was one of the highest travelers in his time.
He visited many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone with his ease, humility and simplicity.
Bringing the message of goodwill and equality, he visited the North, the South, the East or the West in every direction, and received saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankar Dev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Devji visited Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is a famous place that reminds us of Guru Nanak Devji.
Guru Nanak Devji visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
As a result, good relations between learners and Kashmir were established.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him Guru.
He is also venerable in Uzbekistan, wherever he visited.
He gave a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who followed his teachings with full devotion and are still doing it.
Just a few days ago, Ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and all this was the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, several ambassadors had posted their photographs on social media and had shared their good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you will remember the 31st of October.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who served the nation in the spirit of unity.
While Sardar Patel had wonderful ability to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to collaborate with those who had ideological disagreements.
He was a true man of Details.
At the same time, he was a master of organised skills.
He was instrumental in planning and strategies.
Whenever we read and listen to Sardar Saheb's work style, we find out how compelling his organisation was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were scheduled to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
He also used the opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city, which was responsible for the overall system of the session.
And we ensured that no one has to face the problem of water.
Moreover, he was also observing that the goods or slippers of a representative should not be stolen at the place of the session and you would be very surprised to know what Sardar Patel did.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
On the other hand, Khadi's sales also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel did a great job of uniting the princely states.
Sardar Vallabhbhai ji had a special feature that looked at every event.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his focus was on Dursudur Lakshadweep.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is being discussed in certain areas of integration of the country.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1944, our neighbours looked upon Lakshadweep and sent the ship along with their flag.
As Sardar Patel knew, he immediately started a tough operation without wasting time.
Immediately after his orders, the tricolor was fluttered and every mindset of the neighbourhood to capture the Lakshadweep was demolished.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure that the development of the Lakshadweep remains intact.
Today, the Lakshadweep is contributing to India's progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination.
I hope that all of you will visit these beautiful islands and Kufri.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity that was created in the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the tallest statue of the world.
The Statue of Liberty, located in the USA, is twice the height.
The tallest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Indian is elevated with dignity.
You would be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists had come to visit the Statue of Unity.
This means that on an average, 8,500 people visited the magnificence of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, For the country and for all the states, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for tourism industry.
We all testify to how within a year, a place is developed as a world famous tourist destination.
People from India and abroad come there.
Transportation, accommodation, guides, environment friendly arrangements are developing at the same time.
A big economy is developing and people are developing facilities as per the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, It is not a matter of pride that in the past, Time Magazine has made the Statue of Unity an important place among the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that you all will be able to see the Statue of Unity by taking some time out of your precious time.
This is my insistence.
Friends, You are aware that the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country from any prejudice.
Ekta Run for Unity is also being organised on 31st October.
This will include people from every section of the society, every section of the society.
And nowadays, there is a lot of grief and publicity for the marathon.
The Run for Unity is also a unique feature.
Running is beneficial for all of us.
Here the feeling of Fit India is realized by running.
At the same time, we are also associated with the objective of Ek Bharat-Buddha Bharat.
And that is why not just the body, mind and culture are connected to India's unity, to take India to new heights.
Therefore, whatever city you live in, you can connect yourself with a request for Run for Unity around you.
I hope that all of you will run on 31st October for India's unity and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has built the country on the lines of unity.
This mantra of unity has become like a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and mutual understanding of the country.
If we look around, there will be many examples that have been continuously working to increase mutual understanding.
However, sometimes it becomes such that the contribution of the society becomes immersed in memories very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on Ramzanmabhoomi.
Just remember those days when there was an atmosphere.
Whatever groups of their own interests were playing to take advantage of the situation themselves.
What kind of language was being spoken to produce heat in the environment
Efforts were being made to fill the tricks in different voices.
Efforts should be made to reduce tension in the environment.
We must always remember that it gives us immense strength.
That day, that moment is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of how the voice of unity can give strength to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to him.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have listened to those things, so I think I have told you too.
You can imagine that the world's tallest battlefield or the temperature of which goes from zero to 50 degree minus.
The air also has oxygen name.
In such a scenario, it is no less than a milestone in the face of such challenges.
In such a vicious situation, our brave soldiers not only take out their chests to protect the borders of the country but also there are clean Siachen campaigns.
I compliment the people of our country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to rot too.
In such a situation, waste segregation and management are an important thing in itself.
We all know that Siachen is a snow-covered region that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running the Swachhta Abhiyan means ensuring clean water for the people living in the under-privileged areas and also using water from rivers like Nubra and Shok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a festival of awakening a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in Deepawali, buying something new, bringing something from the market, every family has to make a small amount.
Once I had said that we should inspire ourselves to buy local things.
We dont have to go to the taluka if we get the required things from our village.
There is no need to go to the district if found in the tehsils.
We will try to buy as many local items as possible.
The Gandhi Summit will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging our weavers brothers and sisters to buy something made by the hands of our Khadi workers.
This Insolvency Bankruptcy Code has also purchased a lot before its insolvency.
However, there will be a lot of people who think that if I go after Diwali then perhaps I will get a little cheaper.
There will be a lot of people who will still have to buy.
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward to buy local items.
You see, we can also play an important role in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
In Deepawali, we get torn apart by a variety of species.
However, sometimes there is a stir in indifference.
There are also injuries.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great joy.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Perhaps there would be an Indian who would not be proud of our armed forces, our armed forces.
Every Indian, whether it is in any field, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated the Bravery Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the perpetrators of the Practice War under the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces have organized exhibitions at different locations in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, know what our strengths are, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by risking their lives.
The day of Parakram Parv reminds the youngsters of the glorious legacy of our armed forces.
And inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a terrible answer to all those who will strive to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it but not at all by compromising with dignity and at the cost of sovereignty of the nation.
India has always been committed and committed to peace.
In the twentieth century, over one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for peace in the two world wars and that was when we had nothing to do with the war.
Our eyes were never on any other earth.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on September 23, we remembered our brave soldiers from Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers, who relieved Haifa from the invaders, on the completion of hundred years of Haifa in Israel.
It was also a calibration of peace carried out by our soldiers.
Even today, India is one of the largest deployments in the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing a blue helmet.
One of the stake of the parade that people are eagerly awaiting during the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past in which our Air Force showcases its strength with wonderful cars.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
Our Air Force has joined the bravest and most powerful air force of the 21st century today, with 6 pilots and 1 air warriors in 1327.
I convey my heartfelt regards to all the Air Warriors and their families who have been serving the nation.
When the Pakistani attackers launched an unprecedented attack in 1944, it was the Air Force that ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield in order to protect Srinagar from the attacks.
In 1965, the Air Force also gave a befitting reply to the enemies.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1911
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the captivity of the 1970s.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force dumped them by firing bombs at enemy locations overnight.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to our Air Warriors for their commendable work.
From storms, air, floods to forest fires, their morale has been strange to face natural calamities and to help the countrymen.
Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equity in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments to the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving the women the option of a Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that the Armed Forces of India are contributing not only to men power but also to women power.
Women are not only empowered but now they are also becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, Abhilash Tomy, one of our officers in the Navy, was fighting a battle for his life and death.
The entire country was wondering how to save the tommy.
You are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without a single modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he was moving ahead with his pace in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean. However, the terrible maritime calamity created trouble for him.
I had met the tommy earlier too.
Even after coming out of such a difficult situation, the courage that he had, his determination to do something like this once again, is an inspiration for the young generation of the country.
I pray for the excellent health of Abhilash Tomy and his courage, his determination, his determination to sacrifice and win will certainly inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows the importance of 2nd October for our nation.
October 2 this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi across the globe.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or great scholars like Nelson Mandela, each one of them gained strength from Gandhijis ideas and fought a long battle to ensure equality and dignity for their people.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of revered Bapu which needs to be understood by more and more countrymen.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a Constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was gaining momentum, he prepared a revised imitation of those ideas.
Revered Bapu has placed his thoughts before the countrymen on a wide range of topics such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages, workers, cleanliness, spreading education etc.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a folk gatherer.
It was Bapu's specialty to connect with people and connect them with himself.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every individual feel that it is the most important and vital thing for the nation.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
At the call of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle, every region, every section of the society had dedicated themselves.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which is often known as Gandhiji's honour.
In this, Gandhiji had said, I give you a gentleman. Whenever you are suspicious or when you start falling on you, remember the faces of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen and ask your hearts how useful is the step you are thinking of
Is it going to benefit from this
Can he keep his life and destiny under control
Does it mean that those millions of people who are hungry and are unhappy with the soul
Then you will see that your doubts are being cured and ended.
My dear countrymen, a spouse of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the rising middle class in the country, its growing economic power, rising purchasing power, can we remember Bapu for a moment if we go to buy anything
Can we remember that venerable Bapu
What would be the lucky thing that will benefit from your purchase in a straight or dangerous manner
And if the poorest of the poor benefits, then my happiness will be more than usual.
Remembering Gandhijis birth anniversary, whenever we buy something, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must think that every purchase requires a countryman and in that too, who has sweated himself, who has dedicated his talent, all of them must have some benefit.
This is the message of Gandhi Ji. And I believe that the poorest and the weakest person, your small step in his life can bring a very big result.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that cleanliness would lead to freedom, he might not have known how it would be.
Similarly, today we can feel that even with this small task of mine, my country's economic progress, economic empowerment and the power to fight against poverty can be a major contributor to my country's economic progress. And I believe that this true patriotism of today's era is working on this venerable Bapu.
For example, if we consider buying Khadi and Handloom products on special occasions, it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to keep Khadi's old or broken clothes safe because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these khadi clothes are made with utmost hard work and one string of them should come to work.
This feeling of love for the countrymen and affection for the countrymen was inherent in the garb of that great man.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji along with revered Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji comes, there is a feeling of immense faith in the hearts of the people of India.
His gentle personality always fills every citizen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had a special feature that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined as a mountain from within.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a recognition of his immense personality.
The result of his selfless penance towards the nation was that during his brief tenure of one and a half years, he had given mantras to the soldiers and farmers of the country to scale new heights of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering revered Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot remain without talking about cleanliness.
A drive called Swachhata Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I am also fortunate that I would donate cleanliness to the children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to that school whose foundation was laid by Babasaheb himself.
Every class of people across the country joined this workshop on the 15th of this month.
Institutions also contributed to it by Rangechang.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, Media Groups, corporate world, all of them have done a big job in a big way.
I heartily congratulate all these Swachhata lovers for this thing.
Let us listen to a phone call.
You have said a lot that cleanliness has its own importance in everyone's life and toilets were constructed in your houses under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and now you are being provided with this thing.
And perhaps the people associated with this mission are not even able to guess that you are an enlightened person. But if you didn't have a toilet then you might have to spend your life with such difficulties.
Perhaps if you had not called upon the people to talk about this aspect, perhaps it would not have been a sensitivity for the people associated with this cleanliness drive.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world.
This time India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness summit in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, which is Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, and experts from this field are coming together to share their experiments and experiences related to cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu.
It is specially necessary for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the deprived and the underprivileged.
Dr.
In the Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 13.
The NHRC is going to complete 25 years after a few days.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to increase human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are not a concept for us.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideals of Vedic times.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I believe that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been constituted along with the work of human rights at the national level.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and bring them into practice - that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the month of October or be it the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan or be it the beginning of the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayaraj Sindhiya Ji all these great men have been inspiring us all, we salute them and we salute Sardar Saheb on 31st October. I will talk in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I would like to mention that for some years on the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the Run for Unity is being organised in every small town of India, in every small town of India, in every village of the country.
This year too, we should try to organise the Run for Unity in our villages, cities and cities.
Run for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on 31st October we will strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society through the 'Run for Unity' and that will be a great tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has been a great example of social harmony.
There are several such stories in the history of the country, in which one Orchhadi had linked two different states or religions with the stories of faith.
The festival of Janmashtami is also going on after a few days.
The entire atmosphere will be filled with the fervour of elephants, horses, palakhis, Jai Kanaiah Lal Ki and Govinda Govinda.
The joy of painting in the color of Lord Krishna is something different.
Greetings to everyone on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
My best wishes to all fellow citizens on the Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to the girl Chinmi who raised this topic.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the occasion of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in preserving, nurturing and spreading this great legacy to the people.
Every language has its own importance.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil is the oldest language in the world.
And we all Indians are proud of the fact that from Vedic times to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a very big role in spreading knowledge.
The storehouse of knowledge related to every sphere of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which unfinished words are possible.
20000 metals, i. e.
And, therefore, a subtle feeling or a subject can be clearly expressed in any microscopic way.
That is, if a Guru gives his disciple the knowledge of one letter then there is no such thing or wealth in the whole world so that the disciple can lose his Guru's debt.
We all celebrate Teachers Day with this feeling, knowledge and Guru is invaluable and priceless.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
Besides, I thank you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon brings new hopes to our hardworking farmers.
Rainfall provides relief to dry trees and dry streams in the scorching sun.
However, sometimes it also brings a very rainy and devastating flood.
There has been a situation of nature that some places have received more rainfall than others.
We have seen that Kerala has had a very serious impact on the lives of the people.
Today, the entire country is standing with Kerala in this difficult situation.
Our condolences are with those families.
I am confident that with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state, Kerala will be re-established very soon.
But we also see humanity in times of disasters.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other at their respective places to ensure that the life of the people is normal, whether it is Kerala or any other district or region of India.
All the age groups and people associated with every field of work are making their contributions.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are drying up in the rescue operations in Kerala.
He did not leave any stone unturned to save the people trapped in the floods.
Whether it is an air force, a naval force or a ground force or be it BSF, CISF, RAF, everyone has played a major role in the rescue and relief operations.
I would like to particularly mention the hard work done by the brave soldiers of NDRF.
Our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee is one of the topics on which people from all over the country have written the most.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr.
Dream Banerjee, from Katihar in Bihar to Akhil Pandey, who knows that a lot of people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and on MyGov urging me to talk about different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th of August, the nation and the world heard the news of Atal ji's passing away and became very proud of his grief.
A nation leader who had quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he had been away from active politics for the last ten years.
The kind of affection, devotion and grief that has emerged throughout the country for Atal ji reflects his immense personality.
For the past several days, Atal ji's best aspects have come before the country.
India will always remain indebted to Atal ji for the Ninth Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has led to two major changes in India's politics.
Firstly, the size of the Cabinet in the States was restricted to 15 of the Full Assembly Constituencies.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Anti-Pacific Act has been increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Along with this, clear guidelines were also framed to disqualify the participants.
For many years, the political culture of building big ministries in India was home to those big ministries which were designed not for sharing of work but for the sake of making the politicians happy.
Atal ji changed this culture.
These steps saved money and resources.
Along with this, efficiency has also increased.
Atal ji was such a visionary who changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presentation of the budget from 5 PM to 11 PM.
Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the people.
I will definitely say that it will be a great tribute to Atal ji for the healthy democracy, for the best democracy, for the development of good traditions, for the consolidation of democracy and for bringing forward discussions with an open mind.
Just a few days back, the Monsoon Session of Parliament was concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 4.
And as a result, 21 bills and 14 bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha during this session.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of the youth.
Several important legislatures benefiting the youth and the backward classes were passed in this session.
You all are aware that for decades, there has been a demand for setting up of OBC Commissions like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has made a pledge to set up the OBC Commission this time.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Amendment Bill, 2018 to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will safeguard the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent the offenders from committing crimes against the people of this class and irrigate faith in the Dalit communities.
No member can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Occupational Law Amendment Bill enforcing stringent punishment for such offenders and punishing them for at least ten years.
When rapers below 12 years of age will be executed.
Just a few days ago, a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has completed the hearing in just two months and sentenced two criminals of a crime to death on one side.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the culprits to death after just five days of hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts there have made similar payments at a fast pace.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time, in the fourth session, everyone has presented an ideal together.
Today I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the focus of millions of our countrymen is on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first watch the newspapers, TVs, news, social media and watch that an Indian sportsperson has won a medal.
Asian Games are still on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to the sportspersons whose competitions are yet to be held.
Indias sportspersons, especially in boxing and wrestling, are showing excellence but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in such sports, in which we have never seen before, as in sports and boating.
This is not merely a medal, but an advent of Indian sports and sportspersons.
This is a very positive sign that our daughters are involved in the increasing number of medal winners for the country.
Similarly, among the young sportspersons who have won medals, we are youngsters in the age group of 15-16 years.
This is also a very good indicator that most of the players who have won medals are residing in small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts and also pay my tributes to the great player of Hockey, Shri Dhyan Chand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to sports and take care of their integrity as a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then it will create a bright future for India.
Namaste Bhavna ji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen houses and buildings constructed with bricks and stones but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain that was completely rocky was given the shape of an excellent large and wonderful temple, perhaps it was difficult to imagine but this was done.
And that temple is the Kailasnath temple in Ellora, Maharashtra, if you are told that a pillar of more than 60 meters of granite was constructed about a thousand years ago and a 80 tonnes of granite was laid on its top.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Harkoy is surprised to see the voice of the 11th century queen in Patan, Gujarat.
India has been a Bhumi Engineering Laboratory.
There were several engineers in India who made Alpine a visionary and presented a wonderful example in the world of engineering.
In our legacy of great engineers, we have also received such a gem whose work is still surprising to the people.
M.
They are not only revered in that part of the country but the rest of the country also remembers them with great respect and intimacy.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Our country's engineers have made their mark in the entire world by walking on their footsteps.
When I talk about the miracles in the engineering world, I recall the horrific earthquake that struck Kutch in Gujarat in 2009.
So I got the opportunity to visit a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother who was more than 100 years old.
Looking at me, they were making fun of us and saying, Look, this is my house.
In Kutch, it is called Bhungo.
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes in my house.
But you will not be able to see any harm.
This house was constructed by our ancestors according to the natural condition of this place.
And he was saying this thing with pride that I had the same idea that even centuries ago, how the engineers of that period had created it according to the local situation, due to which the common man was safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers' Day, we should think for the future too.
Workshops should be conducted at different places.
What new things should we learn in the changing times
Have to learn
You have to connect .
What should be taught to students
How should ero West be our priority
When we celebrate Engineers' Day, we must think about it.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And along with this, preparations for Diwali also begin.
With this feeling, my best wishes to everyone.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, people are still waiting for rain at some places.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the favourite nature of rain.
But what should we do to the rain
It is human beings who have chosen the path of conflict with nature and consequently, sometimes nature casts it on us.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day Kisht had some other acceptance.
When they went to Saravana in the cave, suddenly due to heavy rains such water was collected near the entrance of the cave.
Their exit route was closed.
Due to lack of roads, all of them stopped at a small cliff inside the cave.
And that is not a couple of days, for the entire 18 days.
On one hand, they were facing difficulties.
On the other hand, humanity in the entire world was demonstrating the surviving human qualities.
People from all over the world were praying to take these children out of peace.
The sense of responsibility at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, the family members, the media, the citizens of the country, everyone has shown this wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was associated with their mission by becoming a team.
I believe that there is a subject like learning and understanding.
It is not that the parents are not sad, it is not that tears do not come out of the eyes of the mothers, but the calm and calm behavior of the entire society is a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity is at an end, it creates wonderful things.
A few days ago, the country's beloved poet Neeraj ji took an injury between us.
Everything can give us a lot of strength and inspiration to the Indians as well.
During our school board exams, we talked about the stress and pendency of examinations, and for students like me, you have a message of condolence.
In fact, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time.
Lakhs of youngsters like Satyam get out of school and get admitted to colleges.
If February and March go to exams, papers and answers, the months of April and May are spent on vacations as well as the consequences are spent on determining the way forward in life, selecting the job.
The attention of the students is limited from home to school.
Students come under the umbrella of their parents.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time we have to leave our homes, leave our villages and get out of a protective environment and make ourselves friends.
All these youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time to lead their lives in a new direction.
I would like to tell all of you that be calm, accept life and enjoy life as a whole.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages.
He has already succeeded in the MBBS examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father nourishes his family with garbage.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are several students who come from poor families and despite their opposite concerns, they have done something that inspires us all.
Whether it is the Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Kolkata's Abhay Gupta, who studied under the street on the footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afreen Sheikh, whose father runs an autorickshaw.
Or be it the Divyang Daughter of Gurgaon, who is suffering from hereditary diseases, a hereditary disease called spine muscular atrophy.
All of them have achieved such a success in the entire world by eliminating every obstacle from their determination and courage.
If we want to be around us, we will get some such examples.
Any good happening in any corner of the country gives strength to my mind and inspire me.
And when I tell you the story of these youngsters then I remember the words of poet Neeraj ji and this is the purpose of life.
I was once talking to two Indian youths in San Jose City, USA known as the Technology Hub.
I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something out of time.
He urged them to convert brain drain into brain gain.
Both the IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji took up this challenge and made an innovative effort.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly developed a Smart Gange App using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can access any information on their mobile phones.
These residents of Taudakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch of the village, District Magistrate, Talka Development Officer, all made the people aware about the use of this app.
It has now become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development works being carried out in the village by recording it through this app.
The app consists of a village phone directory, news department, list of events, health centre and accredited centre.
The Grameen feature of the app, the faculty rate among the farmers, in a way, works like a market for their products.
If you look at this incident carefully then one thing will be taken into consideration that the life that has been created in the United States of America in the midst of lifestyles and customs, the youngsters who have left India many years ago know the miracles of their village, understand the challenges and are associated with the feelings of the village.
This is the reason why perhaps they could make the village properly and they could make it better.
This feeling of attachment to one's village, its roots and the feeling of doing something for the country is naturally felt within every Indian.
However, sometimes because of some distance and sometimes because of some situations a thin dust gets accumulated on it. However, if they are touched by such a small anxiety then good things will emerge again.
Pandharpur is indeed a unique journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July this year, is celebrated as a grand festival of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi, the worker i. e.
This journey, which is called Vari, adds lakhs of workers.
The Father of the great saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram were in Palakhi.
Pilgrims are called Lord Vithal , who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang .
Lord Vitthal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, where people have immense faith and devotion.
Visiting the Vithoba Temple in Pandharpur and its monthly beauty and spiritual joy have a different experience.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to once again experience Pandharpur.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still educating the human beings in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstitions.
Whether it is their burden or their pride, we get the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them.
There is a mantra that society can fight against superstition.
These were the people who from time to time stopped the society, showed the tokens and philosophy and ensured that our ancient families were eradicated from our societies and that the culture of compassion, equality and indifference was irrigated.
We remember Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intellect to show the British rulers the basis of their mistakes.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they insisted on sedition three times in 20 years and that was not a small issue.
Today, I would like to put an interesting incident in front of the countrymen associated with Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad, perhaps 100 years ago.
And during this visit, I got the opportunity to interact with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed by Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 1, 1920, he decided that he would become a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was completed and Sardar Saheb was inaugurated by Khud Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 12.
And I am talking about that time of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of Ganesh Utsav started.
The Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium for furthering the spirit of social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people along with traditional faith and joy.
Well, there was a time when the country had an end to the war against the British. These festivals broke down the sects and sects and worked to embrace everyone.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
This shows how the craftsmanship of our ancient legacy and our brave leaders of history are in our youth.
Today, in many cities, it is such a thing that you can see the gem of Ganesh in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had requested this thing last time too. And today, when I remember Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would urge you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav this time too, to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with full force, but to celebrate Eco-Friendly Ganesh Utsav.
And I would like to say that the items of Eco-Friendly Ganesh Festival should be put on MyGov and Narendra Modi App for wide publicity.
I will convey your message to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak had expressed confidence in the countrymen and he had suggested that Swaraj is our birthright. And we will stop it.
So, Swaraj is our birthright and we will jam with it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development outcomes.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar ji inspired many youngsters for the bravery and freedom of freedom.
Freedom put its life on the hood but he never bowed down to foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Chandrashekhar Azad village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute the two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Das won the Golden uadrilateral.
In response to my letter, I have e-mailed to Indonesia that it is still preparing for the Asian Games.
The country has been named after him.
World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia has won Gold and Bronze medals.
His achievement is special because he has made his challenge a medium of action.
Due to road accidents in 2003, the lower half of the body of daughter Ekta Bhaiyan has become impotent, but this girl has achieved this goal by not losing her courage and strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathuniaji, who won the Golden Moon in Para Athletics Grand Pre-Monx 3 (CHARFANK) in Berlin, also won the Golden Moon in Bhalafang.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals but due to Mausam sometimes diseases also enter homes.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the month of August that inspires our patriotism and for the various festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Once again I will definitely meet for Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Just a few days back, a historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You must have understood a little that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
In this match, both the teams had performed well and the other Afghan boller Rashid Khan had performed well in IPL this year. And I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me on his Twitter and wrote that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Rasheed represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is the world's asset of cricket and at the same time he wrote in some funny style that we should not give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
It is very natural to remember because this was the first match but I will remember that match for some special reason.
The Indian team has done something that is an example for the entire world.
He did what a winning team could do while taking the trophy of the Indian team.
During the trophy of the Indian team, the Afghan team, which played the international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and photographed with both the teams.
We can feel what is the Sportsman Spirit, what is the Sportsmanship.
Sports is a very good way to unite society and to find out the talent that is there in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will come forward and play with each other and with the entire sportsman spirit as well.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a different vision on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world fell at once.
Whether it is the Europian Parliament in Brussels, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese Navy's fighter ships, everywhere people were seen doing Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic Yoga programme and I was told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
India and Chinese soldiers performed Yoga together on the high Berfila peaks of Ladakh.
Yoga works to break all boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a big festival by going above all forms of discrimination - caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world were so enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why should not the enthusiasm of Yoga be multiplied in India
It takes immense pride in the country when 1. 25 billion people see that our country's security forces have studied Yoga at all the three locations of Navy, Army and Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga somewhere in Submarine, some soldiers performed Yoga on the snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our Air Warriors shook everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet between the sky and the earth.
The sight was that he did not sit in the plane but did Yoga in the air.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or fields of sports, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A panorama of Ahmedabad was heart touching.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters have established the world record by practicing Yoga at one place.
I believe that today's Agenda is working as a wellness, revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from yoga will progress.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
Several people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that I will talk about Doctors Day in Mann Ki Baat this time on 1st July.
We remember the doctor in times of distress but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them immensely for their service and dedication towards society.
We are the people who worship God in the form of God, who believe in God that gives us life.
Mother gives birth to us, and sometimes a doctor gives us birth again.
The role of a doctor is not confined to treating diseases only.
Today doctors not only have medical expertise but they also have a lot of experience about the impact of this thing on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark in the world through their capabilities and skills.
In the Medical Profession, along with Maharath, Hardwarking, our doctor is also known for solving the complex medical problems.
Without Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all our doctors on behalf of every Indian.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a prosperous history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no historical event.
See, every place in India has its own heritage.
There are some saints, some great men, some famous person, everyone has their own contribution, it has their own importance.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you would be aware of Gujarat's pride.
When I was working there, I had done a very big national conference for the people associated with the tradition of Saint Kabir.
Do you know why Kabirdas ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who die in Maghar do not go to heaven.
The body that sacrifices in Kashi under it goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered inadequate but Sant Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same superstitions of his time and hence he visited Maghar and took note of it.
Sant Kabirdas ji emphasised on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his witnesses and friends.
It was his ideal.
We see these ideals in his creations and in today's era it is equally inspiring.
One of his friends is: - Kabir Soi Pir Hai, if there is no life on the sides, the meaning of Soka Pirateno or the true Pir Sant is one who knows and understands the sufferings of others, who does not know the sufferings of others, he is brutal.
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social harmony.
He used to think far ahead of his time.
At a time when there was a time of conflict and conflict in the world, he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked towards eliminating discrimination by uniting people.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the betterment of the society.
A system of cooking free from social discrimination where every caste, sect, religion or community can come and eat, Guru Nanak Dev had started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to connect with it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I also urge you people to think about the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, how it should be celebrated in the entire society and around the world, how new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and new imaginations, how we should make preparations and with great pride all of us can make this Prakash Parv an inspiration.
India's freedom struggle is very long, very wide and full of innumerable martyrdom.
It is a history associated with Punjab.
The event of the Jallianwala Bagh incident in 2017 also marked the completion of 100 years, which has embarked upon humanity.
Who can forget the dark day of April 13, 1911 when pills were fired on innocent, unarmed and unarmed people after crossing all limits of cruelty using power.
Victory is always about peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mookerjee's birthday and he wants Dr.
Speak to the countrymen on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji first thank you very much.
It was very good to see you in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields but the areas that were closest to him were education, administration and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would be aware that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at Kolkata University in Bangladesh.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries Minister of India and in a sense he had laid the foundation stone of India and industrial development, had built a strong base, had prepared a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of Independent India, in 1948, brought out the print of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjees dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every sector.
He wanted India to develop big enterprises as well as focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and textiles.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handicrafts Board, All IndiaHandloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 148 to 150 for better development of Kutir and Small Enterprises.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had a huge contribution.
He was dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
As a result of their understanding, wisdom and activity, a part of Bengal can be saved and today it is a part of India.
Dr.
Remembering the message of unity of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, let us be connected with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, to the progress of India.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
I got the opportunity to know directly about the changes that are taking place in the public life by moving ahead of the files.
People talked about their resolutions, their happiness and grief, their achievements.
Girls in remote villages have been providing services ranging from pension to passports of the elderly people of the village through common service centres.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects cereals and does business by making ice creams.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
I don't know how many things were there, there would not be any part of the country where people didn't talk about their success.
In such a scenario, when the common man comes up with new hopes, new zeal and incidents that have taken place in his life then it is not the concern of the government.
Even a small girl from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
For me, a moment spent with the beneficiaries through technology and video bridge has been a very pleasant and inspiring moment. It not only gives me satisfaction to work but also provides an excitement to do more.
There is a new joy, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40,50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge and you have given me new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then something is good somewhere or the other.
There are people who do good.
We can also feel the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing has come to my mind and it is a unique combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming.
Now you would be wondering what is the relation between these two different businesses
However, it is such that corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together in Bengaluru and they have made a comfortable prosperity trust and they have activated the trust for doubling the farmers income.
He joined the farmers and made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only producing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables with the help of trust.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the farmers' participation in profits.
I thank these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have taken the path of connecting the farmers outside their borders, connecting them with the villages and connecting them with the fields.
Once again, I have seen this innovative experiment of my country's younger generation, perhaps I did not know anything, some people might not know, some might not know, but millions and millions of people are continuously doing something good.
GST will complete one year.
The dream of the people of the country One Nation, One Tax has changed in reality today.
One Nation, One Tax Reform, if I have the highest credit for this thing then I give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took decisions in the country and then such a huge tax reform was implemented in the country.
Till now, two meetings of GST Council have been held and we all can take pride in the fact that the people of different states sit there, the people of different states sit there, the states with different priority but the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken with all the consensus.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before the GST but now only one tax has been levied in the entire country.
GST is a victory of integrity and a festival of integrity.
Earlier, there were frequent complaints of Inspector Raj regarding tax matters in the country.
With the introduction of GST, check posts were closed and the movement of goods got faster, which not only saved time but also benefitted from the logistics sector.
The GST may be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a massive tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured through peoples power.
It is generally believed that it takes 5 to 5 years for such a big reform, such a large country and such a large number of people to stabilize them completely. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty is the result of Jan Shakti Partnership.
125 crore Indians have dedicated a big success in themselves.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for Mann Ki Baat, to meet you, to talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
Once again I got the opportunity to be present before you through Mann Ki Baat.
You might well remember that a group of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea trip for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama ji, I want to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their team have returned to India on 21st May after travelling across the world through the sea for more than four days and received them warmly throughout the country.
He cut the distance of about twenty two thousand nautical miles by travelling across various oceans and seas.
This was the first such incident in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
If we want a journey of development of the human race then progress has been made in some or the other adventurous coaches.
In the past, you must have seen that some new things have been taken into account about those who were roaming around the Mount Everest. And for centuries, Everest has been fighting the human race and brave people have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhruve, Pramesh Ale, Umakanth Madvi, Kavidas Kattode, Vikas Soyam, embarked on the worlds highest peak.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur, my small friends and heartiest congratulations.
Sixteen-year-old Shivangi Teacher recently became the youngest Indian woman to earn Everest from Nepal.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest became the first Indian father-son to surrender.
It is not that only the youth are cheating Everest.
Sangeeta Bahele marched to Everest on 1st May and the age of music sister is more than 50 years.
There are also some people who have demonstrated that they have not only skills but also sensitivity.
For years, people have been roaming around Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these entrepreneurs, especially daughters, from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, just a couple of months ago, when I talked about Fit India, I did not think that it would have such a great impact.
A large number of people from all walks of life will come forward in support of it.
When I talk about Fit India then I believe that the more we play the country will play.
People are sharing videos of fitness challenges on social media, tagging each other and challenging them.
Today everybody is joining this campaign of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world, the common man of the country, the army personnel, the school teachers, all the echoes have been heard - Hum Fit to India Fit.
It is a matter of happiness for me that I too have been given the Challenge by Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and this kind of calendar will encourage us to keep fit and keep fit.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that used to be a part of the lives of every child, the sports that used to be wrong and wrong.
These games were particularly a part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
It is outside the house and inside the house as well.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports.
The same game is known by different names in different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
It is played with codes or seeds or dices and with square boards of 8x8.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Who amongst us would not have played Moi Dandiya in her childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) is playing from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vittidalu.
Some sports had a season of their own.
Like kite licking is also a season.
When all kites fly, when we play, we can express our unique qualities to Muktam.
You must have seen that many children are soft nature, but they become very cheerful while playing.
They express themselves, the big ones who are serious, the child who is hiding in them during the game comes out.
Traditional sports are in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our logical thinking, concentration, awareness and zeal are also enhanced.
Children to grandparents, grandparents and grandparents, whenever everyone plays, then whatever is called Pelle is called the Generation Gap, it disappears somewhere.
Many sports make us aware of society, environment etc.
Today, there is a need to promote these sports by coming forward in schools, jewelleries, youth groups etc.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can create a huge archive of our traditional sports.
My dear countrymen, in the next five years, our country will officially be celebrating World Environment Day.
This is an important achievement for India and is a testimony to Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you to ensure that we dont use polyethylene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wild life and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and there are several suggestions that have been given in a very interesting manner - look, know and try to bring them to your daily lives.
When there is extreme heat, when there is floods, when there is no mention of stoppage of rains, when there is unpleasant cold then every person talks about global warming and climate change by becoming an expert but what is the use of this thing
In the last few weeks, we have seen that in different parts of the country, dust storms and heavy winds have caused rains.
There was also loss of lives and damage.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in the weather conditions.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi, in his own way, took up the issue of life-long destruction.
When India played a leading role in the CoP21 and Paris Agreement, when we reconcile the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was in the roots of all, an emotion of realizing this dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, should we all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move in this direction
Can we become innovative
Monsoon is about to come. We can aim at a record tree plantation this time. And not only to plant trees but also to maintain them until they grow up.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You remember the 21st of June, not only you, but the entire world remembers the 21st of June.
21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
Today there are reports that preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day throughout the world.
Yoga for Unity and Harmonios Society is a message that the world has experienced in the last few years.
Yoga leads to adventure which protects us like a Saint Father.
A feeling of forgiveness arises as a mother has for her descendants and mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
The devotees have said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, our sisters, our brothers and sisters, our souls, our beds and our knowledge becomes hungry.
When all these qualities become a partner, the Yogi wins over all kinds of fears.
Once again I urge the countrymen to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation ahead of our legacy of Yoga.
Today is 2nd May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
The memory of this month of May is also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar.
This was my month in 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers showed their bravery were committed against injustice.
Sadly, for a long time, we kept calling the 185 events a mere rebellion or a sepoy revolt.
In fact, if this incident was observed in a neglected manner, it was also an attempt to push our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who devotedly wrote that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but the first war of independence.
The brave Indian House of London, including Savarkar, celebrated its 50th anniversary with Dhammadham.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month that marked the beginning of the freedom struggle.
Savarkar jis personality was full of specialties
He was a devotee of both arms and science.
Generally, Veer Savarkar is known for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj, but apart from that, he was also an embodied poet and a social reformer, who always emphasized respect and unity.
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had depicted a lot of pictures.
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution.
Being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters who were compelled to buy garbage from their homes, today they are learning the work of sewing and wearing clothes to cover the poor.
I wish these daughters, full of hope and confidence, the very best for their bright future.
He has shown that if you have the courage to do something and you are determined to do so, success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties.
And this is not just about Sikar but you will see all this in every corner of India.
If you look around in the neighborhood, you will find out how people overcome the problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people present here.
These discussions are of politics, of social, of movies, of sports and sportspersons as well as of the country's problems and the solutions to these problems should be solved in such a way. However, most of these things are confined to discussions only.
Shriman D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades.
Today you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling their lives with the light of education.
He opened a school called ASHA ASHASHASAN for slum dwellers, where he spends 50 of his income for selling poor tea.
It provides education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I am D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his relationship and giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has defeated the darkness of his life.
Who does not know this Vedic narrative of Thamso Ma Jyotirgamy, but it has been lived up to D.
Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the entire nation.
There will be a series of such inspiring incidents around you.
There will be countless incidents.
Let us pursue our positiveness.
There is so much heat in the month of June that people are waiting for rains and in this hope they look at the blue sky in the sky.
A few days from today, people will also wait for moonlight.
The meaning of seeing the moon is that Eid can be considered.
After a month of fasting during the Ramzan, the festival of Id is the beginning of celebrations.
I am confident that all people will celebrate Id with full enthusiasm and specially children will get a good reward on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Id will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were organized in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
One countries of the world, including India, participated in it.
When such a grand event is organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating in it, can you imagine what kind of atmosphere it is
Emotions, passions, enthusiasm, hopes, aspirations and aspirations. When there is such a climate, who can keep it away from himself.
Our sportspersons too performed well on the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal one after the other.
Whether it is hooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has performed a record.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze India won 66 Medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
Winning a medal is a matter of pride and happiness for the players.
It is a festival of great pride for the entire country, for all the countrymen.
Perhaps the words will be reduced to express this feeling.
But what I have heard from these sportspersons, I would like to share with you.
That is, there were many things this time, which happened for the first time.
Do you know that the number of doctors from India that were present in the Commonwealth Games this time, all the medals have been awarded
Manika Batra won a medal in all the events.
She is the first Indian woman to win Indias Gold in the Individual Table Tennis.
India has received the highest number of medals in shooting.
The only Indian Para Power-lifter to win medals in the Sachin Chaudhary Commonwealth Games.
This time the games were special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, shooting, women sportspersons have done wonders.
In Badminton, two Indian players Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
Sindhu was in between.
The athletes who participated in the games came from different parts of the country and from smaller cities.
His friends have also contributed to maintaining their courage in every situation.
I congratulate all those players and congratulate them.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had called for Fit India with my countrymen, especially with our youth. And I had invited everyone to join Fit India and take the lead in Fit India.
A gentleman, Smt. Shashikant Bhonsle has written in a swimming pool sharing one of his photographs: My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written - I feel myself happy and healthy from the morning walk.
And it further says - For me - fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that the Happiness itself is a fitness.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has posted a video on Twitter.
Many other youngsters have shared their experiences by connecting with the Fit India Forts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
The significance of 21st June International Day of Yoga has now been accepted by the entire world.
You should also prepare from today.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been told has become very popular now.
My young friends, you are now in the midst of a dilemma of exams, exams and exams.
How to celebrate holidays and where to go
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to live and experience a life away from computers through paper-columns.
My young friends, I urge you today for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, HRD or the Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students and students of colleges, youth of NCC, youth of NSS and youth of Nehru Yuva Kendras who want to do something for the society, for the society, for the country and for the society, who want to connect with the changes in the society, who want to become a representative, who have the intention to do something in the society with a positive energy, these are the opportunities for everyone and when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October then we will get the satisfaction of doing something before that and I will also tell you that those who have done the best in colleges, those who have done the best in colleges, those who have done the best in the university will be rewarded at the national level.
Every intern who successfully completes this internship will be given a certificate by Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only that, the internet that will complete it very well, the UGC will also give them two credit points.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this thing for internships.
You can register for the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by visiting MyGov app.
I hope that our youth will further pursue this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
Your-Maidens must send stories, send photos, send videos.
Let us create an opportunity to learn these vacations for a new experience.
I have seen in the past that he was talking about the youth of Delhi who are selflessly engaged in the education of poor children.
This campaign, which started from 15 children in huts near Gita Colon in Delhi, is now connected to 12 places in the capital with 2,000 children.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this mission are engaged in this grave effort to bring about social change by removing free time of 2 hours from their busy schedule.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
His organised efforts have changed the fate not only of his own but also of his own field.
In Bageshwar of Uttarakhand primarily crops of ragi, rajgra, maize or barley are grown.
Being a hilly area, farmers cannot afford the right price.
However, instead of selling the crop directly into the market, the farmers of Copkot Talaq adopted the path of value addition and adopted the path of value addition.
He started making biscuits from the yield and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have created a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started a biscuit manufacturing factory.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being delivered to not only fifty Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kathgodam.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached to Rs. 10-15 lakhs but at the same time, people outside the district have also started stopping after getting employment opportunities for more than 100 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that the world is going to fight against water in the future.
Everyone speaks of this, but is it our responsibility or not
Do we not feel that water conservation should be a social responsibility .
Our ancestors have lived it for centuries.
He has given priority to the importance of one drop of water.
They have discovered new ways to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system, drought management and big temples have been written in the temples.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will get to see a large craft everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Jodhpur with Chand Bau.
It is one of India's largest and most beautiful habitats and it is worth noting that it is in an area where water scarcity remains.
April, May, June and July is such a time that there is a good opportunity to store rain water and if we prepare only in Advanced then the more we get the benefit.
The MGNREGA budget also works for water conservation.
During the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts in the direction of water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management from the MGNREGA budget every year.
In 2017-18, I have been spending about 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64 thousand crore or about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation.
Over the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted in a big way through water conservation and water management measures.
The MGNREGA budget for water conservation and water management has been immensely benefitted by some people.
Kerala's Kuttumperur, thousands of people working in the river Manrega revived the river by working hard for 70 days.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-filled rivers but there are some areas in Uttar Pradesh as two small rivers named Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district system has expedited a large number of soil and water conservation works under MGNREGA.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, this narrow Khadri river has revived the dry land.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, farming, villages, this is a big blessing.
I would like to say that once again April, May, June and July are before us, let us also take up some responsibility for water conservation, let us also formulate some schemes, let us also do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages from all sides, papers and phone calls.
We celebrate Ravinder Jayanti every year but many people do not know about the philosophy of the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's pacefully, beauty and integrity.
Discuss this in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can know about it.
I thank Ayan ji for attracting the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a person full of wisdom and wisdom, which left an indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a brilliant personality, a multi-dimensional personality but one of his teachers can feel it every moment.
He has written in the lyrics, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibilities to impart to the students.
I don't know the Bangladeshi language, but when I was small, I used to get used to getting up very early - from childhood and from eastern India the radio starts very soon.
When the delays started in western India, I was supposed to be in the morning till about 5:30 in the morning, Rabindra Sangeet started, I was used to it on the radio.
I was used to listening to Rabindra Music by waking up early in the morning. And when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems of Anandalok and Agunar and Poreshmoni, I got a sense of consciousness.
You must have influenced Ravinder Sangeet and his poems.
I pay tributes to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full respect and respect all over the world.
The social aspect of Rosa is that when a person is hungry then he also feels hungry for others.
When he is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to recall the teachings and messages of Pyagambar Mohammad Sahib.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood in their lives.
Once a person asked Pyagbar Saheb, what is the best work in Islam
Pyagambar Saheb said, Feeding a poor and needy person and meeting everyone with goodwill, even if you know that you do not know.
Pyagambar Sahib believed in knowledge and compassion.
He was not arrogant about anything.
He used to say that pride only defeats knowledge.
Paigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have more than required goods then it is important for you to give it to a needy person.
People donate money to the needy in this sacred month.
Pyagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is immortal in his soul, not from wealth and oppression.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions around the world.
This Buddha Purnima, remembering Lord Buddha, trying to follow his path, making a solemn pledge and reminding all of us of this responsibility.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values that require the highest in the world today.
Babasaheb Ambedkar used to assert that his social philosophy inspires Lord Buddha.
Baba Saheb had empowered crores of people who were oppressed, exploited, deprived and underprivileged through the Constitution.
This cannot be a big example of compassion.
This compassion for the suffering of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and they used to follow the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and it has been happening all the time.
Throughout Asia, we have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha.
This tradition of Buddha is rooted in many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar. And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which connects important places of South-East Asia with Indias special Buddhist destinations.
I am also glad that the Government of India is a part of the reconstruction of many Buddhist temples, including the magnificent Ananda Temple of the centuries old in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is an unwavering and humanitarian agony and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to eradicate hatred.
I wish Buddha Purnima to all those who have faith in the principles of compassion and have faith in Lord Buddha spread all over the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in Indias defence history.
You would be wondering what is the relationship between smiling Buddha and India's military power
You must remember that 20 years ago on the evening of 11th May, 18th, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji addressed the nation and his words filled the country with pride, valour and happiness.
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1988, atomic tests were conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan on the west side of India.
Indias experiment was successful and in a way, India showcased its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as an exhibition of its military power in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength, inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you are strong as a nation, you can remain peaceful with everyone.
The month of May, 1988 is not only important for the country but it is important that atomic tests were conducted in this month.
He showed the entire world that India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given a mantra - Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
However, we will also be able to derive a new pleasure and satisfaction from the journey that Atal ji had launched.
My dear countrymen, when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat, I will talk about more.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the auspicious festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen in his life the power of Ram in the life of venerable Bapu.
Recently, on 26th January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were present here, they had brought a cultural troop with them. And it is a matter of great pride that most of these countries were presenting Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing the same inspiration and influence not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, this time too, I have received all the letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments from all of you.
I read what MyGov wrote about the online course of Sanskrit on MyGov.
Besides being an IT professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I would also urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to think about what can be done in the context of the suggestions made by him.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar, you read the comments on NarendraModiApp.
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing ground water level is of utmost importance.
ShrimanNal Shastri ji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals in the summer summer.
I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadrasha ji, he says that I talk to the youth about his health this time.
They feel that our youth is physically weak in comparison to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we should talk to everyone in detail about health - Fit India.
And you all can join hands with the youth and also run the Fit India Movement.
During his visit to Kashi, the French chief, Shriman Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the visions of this journey were touching, impressing and impressing.
And he urged them to broadcast all the photos, all the videos on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put these pictures on social media and NarendraModiApp on that day.
Now, please lick them and retweet them, send them to your friends.
From Chennai, Ananda, Jayesh and many other children have sent me the ideas they had in their hearts about the Gratitude Cards they had given behind the Exam Warrior book.
Andha, Jayesh, I would like to tell all the children that your letters drive away the tiredness of my day.
All such letters, all these phone calls, comments, whatever I have read from them, all these things have been heard and many of these things have touched my mind. If I talk about them only then perhaps for months I will have to say something continuously.
This time, most of the papers are children who have written about examinations.
He has mentioned about his schemes on holidays.
In the summer heat, we are concerned about water for animals.
Farmers have received letters from brothers and sisters regarding Kisan Melas and farming activities across the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed.
It means that our mindsets also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the thoughts of our minds change somewhere in the life of somebody.
And why not
In these things, in your experiences, in your examples, all the inspiration, all the energy, all the spirituality and the country has the courage to do something for you.
It has the power to change the weather of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, has built new schools for the poor children through his will power, then it shows the indomitable willpower of the country.
In his mission, Saidul sold his household and collected money through donations.
Several pilgrims travelling in their cabs have donated freely.
An engineer daughter gave her first salary
Thus, after twelve years of collection of funds, the brave attempts made by Saidul Laskar brought them color and today due to his hard work and determination, he is ready to become a 30-bedded hospital in Punari village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of a New India.
Today, the perspective of India has changed across the world.
Today, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section of the country, this belief has been awakened.
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
A positive atmosphere of hope and aspirations has emerged.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfil our resolution of a New India and will fulfil our dreams.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have come in the context of agriculture.
This time, I also watched a video of the discussions with the farmers on Doordarshan's DD Kisan channel and I feel that every farmer should connect with this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and should look at it and implement the experiments in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and general public life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had repeatedly stressed on the need for conservation of plants, trees and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia had talked about massive public awareness for better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and ensuring all of them and increasing food and milk production.
In his speech in 1991, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji insisted on the need for farmers to use new technology and innovate.
I went to the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi in the past.
There, my interaction with the farmer brothers and sisters and the scientists, knowing about the experiences related to agriculture, understanding about innovation related to agriculture, all this was not only a pleasant experience for me but what influenced me the most was the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This low-lying state has done a very big job.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is determined, there is determination and resolve in the mind, it can be achieved and demonstrated.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is being done with the help of technology, which is giving a lot of strength to the agricultural producer.
In the letters I have received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the feeling of sufficiency and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that the cost of the notified crops will be announced at least one and a half times of the cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the villages with Wholesale Market and then with the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce so that 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded to the required inter-market and connected to APMC and e-NAM platforms.
That is, in a way, a system is being created for direct connectivity of any market in the country with the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our resolution but also how can one and a half crore Indians give a best tribute to Gandhiji by joining hands
How can new activities be respected for this
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
You should suggest how slogans or mantras or horse sentences are.
Together, we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him to take our country to new heights.
Thank you very much. And I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are both complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a stringent approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Health Ministry only when all the departments and ministries, be it the Swachhata Ministry, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with the preventive health.
Preventive Health Care is both the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive health care, the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
The first requirement for a healthy life is cleanliness.
As a result, sanitation coverage has doubled to almost 80 in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level to create health wellness centres across the country.
As a result of the commitment of all of us, Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached every household.
This time the International Day of Yoga has saved less than 100 days for 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people participated enthusiastically everywhere in the country and around the world.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and all for Yoga from now on.
Yoga has to be popularized in children, in the youth, in the elderly, in all the age groups, in man or woman through new entertainment methods.
Though TV and electronic media of the country do different programmes on Yoga during the year, but can we create awareness about Yoga in the form of a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need Yoga practicers, but some people have made me Yoga teachers through their creativity and have created 3D animated videos by doing my yoga.
I will share that video with all of you so that we can study asanas, pranayama along with us.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that health care is within reach and nutritional, affordable and accessible to the common man.
Prices of heart stents have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The number of MBBS seats in the country's prevailing 4 medical colleges has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
We will see all of us collectively strive to get rid of B.
Years ago Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For them, industry was an effective medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the Make in India campaign is going on successfully in the country, Dr.
The vision of Ambedkar Ji as an industrial power that he had dreamt of is an inspiration for us today.
Today, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world and today FDI inflows into India are the largest in the world.
The whole world is seeing India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
This was the idea that the growth of industries would be possible only in the cities due to which Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar believed in the Urbanization Urbanisation of India.
He never wanted a person to live his life in poverty.
At the same time, he believed that poverty cannot be eradicated only by sharing something among the poor.
Today Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
During the 1930s and 1940s, when only roads and railways were being talked about in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways.
He was a Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as a nation power.
He emphasized on the use of water for the development of the country, various river valley authorities, various water related commissions - this was the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on various coasts of India and inter-market is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 1940s, most of the discussions took place in the context of the Second World War, the Cold War and the Partition.
In a way, Ambedkar had laid the foundation of Team India Spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism, and stressed on working together with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of Cooperative Federalism, Cooperative Federalism and Competitive Cooperative Federalism in every aspect of governance and most importantly, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary to move forward that a large or a poor family is born, but those born in the poor families of India can also dream of, they can make efforts to fulfil their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it also happened that many people had visited Dr.
We tried to push them back and we made every possible effort so that the sons of the poor and the backward families cannot move forward, become something and not achieve anything in their lives.
But the portrait of a New India is quite different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor and the backward.
Under this, there will be separate programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this mission.
My dear countrymen, several festivals are going to be held in the coming days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
It is a day to remember the sacrifices and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life philosophy of Bhagwan Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
On the eve of the discussion, I remember the inspiring teachings of Lord Jesus Christ, who gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to the civilized humanity.
In April, Punjab and West India will celebrate the festival of Vaisakhi. These days, Judiciary and Satvine in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and the joy and joy of Polio Vaisakh in West Bengal will continue.
All these festivals are in some form or the other connected with our farming and food providers, through these festivals, we thank nature for the invaluable gifts that we receive in the form of produce.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar has started Mann Ki Baat today with a phone call.
Several questions related to science have been asked by my young friends.
We have seen that sea colours are blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought whether it is river or sea, why water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes before us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light skatering.
One of his discoveries is known as "Roman Effect".
We observe National Science Day on 28 February every year, as it is said that this day a search was conducted about the incident of light skating, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great scholars like Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta, on the other hand, we have a great pride and dignity in the field of medicine.
India is proud of scientists from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the renowned particle Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles happening in the field of science.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can help in improving the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate access to healthcare and treatment of diseases in a modern way
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad, at the inauguration of the I Create.
There is a young man who has developed a digital instrument that if one cannot speak, he can interact with oneself while writing his own words through the instrument.
I understand that we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology are valued coastal.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do as we want.
But, it depends on us what we want to do with machines.
Humanitarian vision becomes important here.
Use of science for the welfare of mankind, experiment to attain the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who invented the light bulb, failed several times in its experiments.
Together, I am fortunate to be here today at Okroville, the land of Maharishi Arabic.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of his life as a great saint.
Find answers and wait for humans.
The feeling of repeated questions is important to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my greetings to all our scientists and scientists.
May our younger generation be inspired to discover truth and knowledge, inspired to serve society with the help of science, my best wishes for this thing.
Friends, I have often received a lot of messages regarding security and disasters in times of crisis. People keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Shriman Ravindra Singh spoke on the subject of Occupational Safety in his comment on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that the safety parameters on factory and construction sites in our country are not so good.
As the next 4th of March is Indias National Safety Day, the Prime Minister spoke of the safety and security of the people in his Mann Ki Baat programme.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one pro-activeness and the other pre-preparedness.
Safety is of two types - one that is required at the time of disaster, safety during discipline and the other that is required in day to day life.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, we cannot achieve it, then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
We have often read the boards written on the roads, it says - 'Vigilance Hatti' - a loss, a loss, a loss of happiness, a joy, a joy, not abandoning the world, not protecting the security from security, these words have never been used in our lives.
We can safeguard our lives if we remain vigilant and follow the regulations, but we can also emancipate ourselves with great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that there are several sources of safety at the work place but whenever they want, they do not seem to be followed.
I urge that municipalities, municipalities with fire brigades, should go to different schools once in a week or once in a month to drive them in front of school children.
Fir Brigade will also have a habit of staying alert and the new generation also gets its education and there is no expenditure for this thing. In a way, education is a hierarchy.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the Disaster Management in the country.
An initiative called Apada Mitra has also been taken to train volunteers in flood and cyclone hazard districts.
Training and awareness have a big role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to low-heatwave.
Thereafter, workshops for the prevention of NDMAhtways were organised to create awareness among the people.
A good outcome has emerged from everyones participation.
The death toll from Lu in 2017 was surprisingly reduced to around 20.
It can be observed that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, be it social organisations or be it awakening citizens. I want to speak to everyone who is in a dilemma and is engaged in relief and rescue work within minutes.
And the number of such misappropriation heroes is no less.
(BIMSTEC) - A Joint Disaster Management Exercise of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal was also conducted in this country.
We have to become a risk-conscience society.
In our culture, we always talk about values, safety of values, but we have to understand the values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
What did it mean, what was the arrangement for information
Because we are not conscious of nature and for that reason our ears are heard after sitting in the airplane but none of us feels like this.
This unique experience is in every sphere of our life.
We should not think that Safety is for anyone else, if all of us become conscious of our safety, then the feeling of social security is also included.
The objective of the GobarDhan scheme is to clean the villages and to generate wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid waste into compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China use cow dung and other biodegradable wastes of animals to produce energy but are not fully utilized in India.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving in this direction.
The target is to make use of biogas based energy for dung dung, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, in rural India, farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged to look at dung and waste not only as waste but as income source.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping the villages clean, improve animal health and increase productivity.
Biogas will enhance self-sufficiency in energy matters for cooking and lighting.
It will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New jobs will be provided for waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will also be created to facilitate the smooth setting up of 'Gober Dhan Yojana' which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers get the right price for cow dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by forming a self-help group and forming cooperative societies.
I invite you to become partners in the movement of clean energy and green jobs and take initiatives in the direction of converting waste into wealth in your village and making round-the-clock.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh where the first garbage festival was organised in the state.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness, create awareness about the various ways to create awareness about the city's waste and reuse of garbage.
During this festival, various activities took place, ranging from students to the elderly, all of them participated.
Different types of waste materials were manufactured using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
A music performance was organised on the theme of cleanliness and Art work was done.
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals were also held in other districts.
Innovative ideas, deliberations and poems were read on the occasion of Swachhata, initiated by each one of them.
An atmosphere like a festival was created in the context of cleanliness.
The way schoolchildren took part in excitement was unique.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative exhibition of the importance of waste management and cleanliness in this festival.
Every year on 8th March, the International Women's Day is celebrated.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past are also being honoured with the "Nar Shakti Puraskar" in the country.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyaanandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women power has shown self-confidence and self-confidence through their actions.
He has not only taken the country forward but has also worked to take the country and society forward and take it to a new height.
In fact, the dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and equal partners in the overall development of the country.
In the past, a very beautiful suggestion was made to me by a great personality.
He suggested that there are several programmes to celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, to honour the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and town.
I was wondering if I could talk about a long life in it and I was reaching out to you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women and 15 lakh women have organized a month-long cleanliness drive.
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example in just 20 days by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
Can you imagine what a big event this is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is such a power that will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan and the Sanskrit Sanskrit into a mass movement.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You all are well aware that Elephanta Island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea .
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and such a huge tourist destination, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, the darkness in the lives of the people of three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sethbandar has now become dark and their life has become illuminating.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will now be lighted with electricity.
This is not just an electricity but a new beginning in the direction of development.
What could be the moment of satisfaction and happiness for the countrymen if their lives are bright and their lives are happy
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now this is the specialty of this month that the golden emergence of the joyful waves and the splendor of a man who embraces his heart.
But all of us are also very fond of this month's Holi festival.
On 2nd March, the entire country will celebrate the festival of Holi with joy.
The importance of Holi is equally important because this day is a day to burn and destroy evils in the fire.
Holi is auspicious occasion to forget all the griefs, to participate in each other's happiness and happiness and gives a message of love unity and fraternity.
Greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Holi.
May this festival be filled with colorful joy in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January, 2018
This is the first episode of Mann Ki Baat 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history it was such that heads of 10 countries were present at the event.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch upon the topics written in his letter.
He has written that imagination in space on February 17 is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Columbia Spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youngsters from all over the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the departure of Chawla.
It is sad for everyone that we have lost the imagination of Chawla at such a young age, but he has conveyed this message to thousands of women from all over the world, especially to India, that there is no limit to women power.
Whether it is a desire or a determination or a desire to do something, nothing is impossible.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women in India are progressing rapidly in every field and are increasing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, their place and their contribution in the society has surprised the whole world.
Indian adversaries have a long tradition.
Many of India's adversaries have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreya, there are many names.
Today, we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, however, in our scriptures centuries ago, it has been said in Skandapuran: Dashputra Samakanya, Dashputrana Pravardhayan.
The more money the ten daughters get, the more virtue the more it gets, the more it gets from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of Shakti.
This women power binds the entire nation, the entire society, the family and the society in the spirit of unity.
Smt. Prakash Tripathi has given several examples.
He has written that it is inspiring to fly our brave Defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Sukoi 30.
He also mentioned that under the leadership of Vrika Joshi, women crew members of the Indian Navy are circumnavigating the globe on INSV Tarini.
Three brave women have become Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani four-wheeler pilots and are undergoing training in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Capacity Building, All Women Crew flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and Parat Delhi to Air India Boeing Jet and all the rest of the women.
Honble President has taken a new initiative in the past.
The President visited a group of exceptional women who had done something first in their respective fields.
The first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman train driver of passenger train, first woman fire fighter, first woman bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, thus the first woman to reach Everest.
Our women powers have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the stereotype of society.
He demonstrated that a new path can be built by crossing all the odds and obstacles on the strength of hard work, determination and determination.
A path that will inspire not only our contemporaries but also generations to come.
We will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book has also been prepared on the insurance secretary, First Ladies, so that the entire country can know about these women powers, take inspiration from their lives and works.
It is also available in the form of e-book on NarendraModi website.
Today, the women power of the country has an important role in the positive change in the country and the society.
Today, as we talk about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment, you must be wondering what is the relationship between these two
Mumbai's Matunga Station is India's first station with all women employees.
In all the departments, be it Women Staff or Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Chakra or Entrepreneurship or Point Person, the staff of more than 40 employees belongs to women.
This time, many people, after watching the Republic Day Parade, wrote on Twitter and on other social media that one of the key features of the parade was the BSF Biker Continent in which talented women were participating.
He was experimenting with courage and was also surprised by the visitors from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women power is leading.
When it comes to tribal women, a definite picture emerges in the minds of women who have forests, footsteps and sticks on them.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new image before the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is an area affected by Maoism, has created a terrible environment by the perpetrators of violence, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a dangerous area by running an E-Rikshaw.
In a short span of time, a lot of women have joined it.
On the one hand, while self-employment has worked to empower them, on the other hand, the pictures of Maoist-affected areas are changing.
And along with all this, it is also strengthening the work of environmental protection.
Over the centuries against social evils and malpractices, there have been continuous efforts at individual and social levels in our country.
Just a few days ago, Bihar took an interesting initiative.
More than 13,000 kilometers of worlds longest human chain, Human Chain, was built to eradicate social evils in the state.
Through this mission, people were made aware of the virtues of childhood and burning practices.
The entire state took a pledge to fight against malpractices such as incense and child marriage.
Children, elderly people, youngsters, mothers, sisters, everyone had participated in this gathering.
The human chain started from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna unbreakablely touched the borders of the State.
It is essential that our society is free from these evils so that all the people of the society get the benefit of development in the true sense.
Let us collectively take a pledge to eradicate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and prosperous India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration and every person in the human chain who has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, My dear countrymen, Karnataka has written on MyGov: On the treatment of his father, the cost of medicines used to be Rs.
He had not known earlier about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendra.
But now when they came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines has come down to 5.
He expressed his desire that I talk about it in Mann Ki Baat programme so that maximum people can know about it and take advantage of it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about it.
I have also seen several people on video and social media who have benefited from this scheme.
And it gives me immense pleasure when I get this kind of information.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had thought that whatever he had received would be available to others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care Affordable and to promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been cheaper by nearly 50 to 0 from the branded medicines available in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday, to a great extent.
The generic medicines sold are based on the standards of World Health Organisation.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for the Industrial Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and AMRUT stores of hospitals.
The only objective behind all these is to make the poorest of the poor eligible for uality and Affordable Health Services available so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo was such that my attention was drawn towards the pictures.
The photograph was such that a grandson along with his grandfather was participating in the cleanliness drive of the Clean Morana river.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morana under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river had flown for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal.
The other thing is that the river was completely filled with wild wounds, water wells.
A lot of waste was being put on the river and its banks.
An action plan was prepared and on 13th January, a day before the Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morana, both sides of the Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of four kilometres.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this novel work of Mission Clean Mora.
This Swachhata programme was continued on 20th January, 2018 and I am told that the campaign will run every Saturday morning till the river Mora is completely cleaned.
It shows that there is nothing impossible if a person decides to do something.
Large changes can be brought about through mass movements.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, to the administration of the district and municipal corporation, to every citizen engaged in making this work a peoples movement and this effort of yours will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you will be listening to a lot of discussions regarding the Padma awards.
Newspapers also draw attention to this subject and TV.
But if you look at it with simplicity then you will be proud of the fact that how great people are amongst us and it will naturally be proud to see how the common man in our country is reaching those heights without any feeling of pride.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma Awards but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
The entire process has become transparent due to online process.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been completely transformed.
Now the significance of the award is not only the identity of the person but the importance of his work is increasing.
You would be happy to know that Aurobindo Ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, dedicated his entire life in making sports for children.
They have been making sports from four decades of waste so that the curiosity of science can increase in children.
It is their endeavour to inspire children towards scientific experiments through waste products, for which they are inspiring children by showcasing films made in 18 languages across the country in 3000 schools.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication.
One such thing is that of Karnataka's Sitava Jodti.
They are not called goddesses of women empowerment.
In Belagavi over the last three decades, he has contributed in transforming the lives of countless women.
He had dedicated himself to Goddess at the age of seven but later he spent his entire life for the welfare of the Goddesses.
Moreover, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family and tribal family of Madhya Pradesh.
He used to do ordinary jobs for leading a life, but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this same condolence, they are respected not only in India but in the entire world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy.
Bhujju Shyam ji, who brought laurels for India abroad, was recognized and honored with Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised to hear Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests.
He has built 500 Herbal Medicines based on his memory.
He added that snake charmers are being used for making medicines.
Lakshmiji is continuously serving the society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
He was honoured with Padmashri for his contribution to the society.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other households to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated freely in their hard worked hospitals.
I am confident that there are many such male and female wives in our Bahuratna Basundhara whom no one knows or knows.
Padma Awards are a medium but I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people around us who have been dedicated to the society, who have been dedicated to the society, who have worked with some specialty and have sometimes brought them among the society.
They do not work for dignity but their work inspires us.
Sometimes people should listen to their experiences by calling them in schools, colleges.
Beyond the awards, there should be some effort in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the 9th January when venerable Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa to India.
On that day, we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bonds between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized a programme that invites all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin residing around the world.
You will be happy to note that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, United Kingdom, Suriname, South Africa and other countries where our original Indian mayor is present, all of which participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries, they have also maintained a strong relationship with India and this time they have sent me a calendar to the European Union, in which they have shown their contributions in various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians, who live in different countries of Europe, who are working in cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who touch the minds of the society through their music and somebody from their poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, the people of Indian origin for doing RECOGNISE and through them to inform the people around the world.
On 30th January, the death anniversary of revered Bapu has shown us a new path.
Even at present, we take every step to see how true Bapu's words were.
If we make a solemn pledge to walk on the path of Bapu, what can be a bigger homage than what can be achieved
My dear countrymen, with the greetings of 2018, I end my speech.
Mann Ki Baat December, 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year and coincidence that today is also the last day of 2019.
We and you have shared a lot of things this year.
Many of your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat always bring a new energy for me.
Years will change after a few hours but this sequence of our discussions will continue even further.
In the coming year, we will do more innovative things, we will share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Recently, on the 25th of December, the Breakfast Festival was celebrated worldwide.
People in India also celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recall the great teachings of Christ and Isha Christ, the most important thing that the Christ emphasized was Sewabhav.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and on the basis of these values he lived his life.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior, worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against persecution and injustice.
He exhorted people to break the barriers of caste and religion.
In these efforts, they had to lose a lot individually.
But he never gave place to the feeling of hatred.
The message of love, sacrifice and peace in every moment of his life was his personality filled with so many great features.
Let us take all the pledges and take inspiration from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and from his inspiring life, let us strive to lead our lives accordingly.
Those born in or after 2000 will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century as New India voters.
I congratulate these youngsters and urge everyone to register as their voters.
The entire India is eager to welcome you as the voters of the 21st century.
You will also be proud of the 21st century voters.
Your vote will become the basis of New India.
The power of vote is the biggest strength of democracy.
Mat is the most effective tool for bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions.
However, you can also become the builder of the 21st century India and it has been started especially since January 1.
And today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to our bright young minds who are full of energy and determination for 18-25 years.
I am confident that the skills and strengths of our energy-efficient youth will fulfil our dream of a New India.
When we talk of a New India, a New India free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be dirty and free from poverty.
New India where there is equal opportunity for all, where everyones aspirations are fulfilled.
A New India where peace, unity and harmony are our inspiration.
My New India Youth should come forward and churn out how a New India will be created.
They should also set a path for themselves to connect those who are associated with them and keep on moving forward.
You should also move forward, the country should move forward.
Today, when I am talking to you, I got an idea as to whether we can organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Where these 18-25 year olds sit together and churn on a New India, find ways and formulate schemes.
How can we fulfil our resolutions before 2022
How can we create an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a peoples movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the glorious 21st century India.
How to achieve salvation
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to know how this New India Youth gets to know about all these opportunities in one place and a system should be created so that at the age of 18, they can easily understand all these things about the world and get the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about the importance of positivity.
I am reminded of a shloka of Sanskrit. It means a person full of excitement is very strong because nothing can be done beyond enthusiasm.
There is nothing impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People say in English - Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share your positive moments of 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people gave a very positive response to the social media platform, MyGov and the NarendraModi App.
Lakhs of tweets were received along with Positive India hashtag (positive India) which reached out to more than 1. 5 crore people.
In a way, the communication of positivity in India spreads across the world.
The tweets and responses that came were truly inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some of the countrymen have shared this year's events that had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I talk to the bodels.
Our insurance covered a premium of one rupee per month.
This was done by my husband and he died in an accident.
We only know what was our situation at that time.
With this help of the government, we got a lot of benefits and I could have got a little seat.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
From our village, Bhinnar village has been passing National Highway since 2019.
This will improve our roads and also increase our trade.
My name is Dipinshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Sadanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewai.
Our area had a problem of water and forty years we had to rely on the Armenic pipeline.
Now this pipeline has been separately - independent.
So all these big achievements are in our year 2017.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level which are bringing about a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Come, let us enter the New Year with these little joys, let us begin the New Year and take a strong bond from Positive India to Progressive India.
When we talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspirational story of the poster Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak of the administrative service in Kashmir.
He has secured first rank in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Service outside the brunt of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in the 10th century terrorists burnt their ancestral homes.
Terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their ancestral land.
The atmosphere of such violence around it was enough for a small child to create darkness and bitterness in his heart but the fig did not allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of public service.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that whatever the situation may be, the clouds of depression can also be spread through positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The excitement, enthusiasm, dreams and when I was listening to them, they want to make progress in the field of life.
I also got inspiration from the time I spent with those daughters. And that is the strength of the country. This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of famous religious places of the world, it is very natural for us to talk about the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala.
Every year crores of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
Is it a big challenge to maintain cleanliness where such a large number of devotees come here
And especially in the place that lies between mountains and forests.
But the Sabarimala temple itself is an example of how this problem can be transformed into a culture, how to find a way out of the problem and how the power of public participation is so much.
P.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched a program, Puneyam Punakvanam and launched a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And this kind of tradition has been created that travellers who come, their journey is not complete unless they do any physical work in the programme of cleanliness.
There is neither big nor small in this campaign.
Every traveller, considering a part of the worship of God, gives some time for cleanliness, works and works to eradicate dirt.
Everyday in the morning the scene of cleanliness is very unique and all the pilgrims get involved in it .
Every person becomes a part of this 'Punyanam Punakvanam' programme like an ordinary traveler who doesnt have a large CELEBRITY, no matter how rich he may be, no matter how big he is, no matter how big he is, no matter how big he is, no matter how big he is, no one moves ahead after cleaning it.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The cleanliness drive that has taken place in Sabarimala and the Punyan Punakvanam in it becomes a part of every passenger's journey.
At the same time, along with strict vows, cleanliness is also accompanied by a firm resolve.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, we have resolved that the incomplete work done by venerated Bapu is Swachh Bharat, a clean India free from dirt.
Revered Bapu continued to strive and strive for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu was 150th Birth Anniversary, we should do something about giving him the India of his dreams, a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Broad mass participation in rural and urban areas is also witnessing changes.
Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the achievements of sanitation level in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities in a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be examined in this survey are Open Defecation Free (ODF) in cities, Traffic Facility for Waste Feeding, Processing of Waste Scientifically, Efforts made for Behavioral Exchange, Capacity Building and innovative efforts made for sanitation and public participation for this work.
During this survey, different teams will go and inspection cities.
He will talk to the citizens and take care of them.
The Swachhta App will be used and analysis will be carried out in various service places.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the hallmark of the people and the nature of the city.
Cleanliness should not be done by the government alone.
Every citizen and civil society has a huge responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to participate enthusiastically in the cleanliness surveillance that will take place in the coming days.
And dont leave your city behind, dont leave behind your lanes, do not leave it behind.
I am sure that the use of green and blue wastes by separating dry wastes and wet wastes from the house has become your habit now.
In the Swachhta Survekshan conducted during 4th January to 10th March, 2018, you should not be left behind in this healthy competition of cleanliness.
And you all should have a dream: Our City - Our Efforts, Our Progress - Progress of the Nation.
With this resolution, let us once again recall the revered Bapu and take a pledge to make a Swachh Bharat and fulfil our malnutrition.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that are very small to see but as a society our identity is being influenced far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
One thing has come to our notice that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without 'Maharam' or her male guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time, I wondered how this could happen.
Who would have made such rules
Why such discrimination
And when I went into its depth, I was disturbed - even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who used to impose such restrictive measures.
For decades, injustice was being done to Muslim women but there was no discussion about it.
Even in many Islamic countries, this rule is not there.
But in India, Muslim women were not entitled to this right.
And I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs also took such necessary steps and we abolished the tradition that has been going on for 70 years and we abolished this restrictive system.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without pride and I am glad that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without any hesitation and women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to the North have expressed their desire to travel on Haj pilgrimage.
I say with full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of Indias development, the strength of our women power, the faith of their talent, will continue to move forward.
It should be our constant endeavour that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities for men so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This time, on Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years in 2017 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians that these great leaders of 10 countries of the world are present together on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we all have a Christmas and a new year is about to come.
May the coming new year bring joy, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us all move ahead with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of sunrise and in this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
Lohri No is a joy in Punjab and North India, while UP-Bihar is awaiting Khichdi and Tala-Sankranti.
Say Sankrit in Rajasthan, Madh-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals are special in themselves and they have their own importance.
Each festival is celebrated from 13th to 19th January.
The names of these festivals are different, but their roots are the same - linkages with nature and agriculture.
Many congratulations to every citizen of the country for these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my countrymen.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that speaks with a lot of talent, with a little brother and sister.
Listen to the fact that even in this phase of Ayushman Bharat, Lata Didi is eager for all the things related to the country. And the satisfaction of life is also in India's progress.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam.
I am speaking Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Namaskar
Modiji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go and return
Modi ji: I will be back at 28th late at night and at 2nd in the morning and then it will be your birthday.
Lataji: There are many people in the age group but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those big ones who are bigger than their own work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are a very old man in your age and you are a big man in your work and you have achieved this goal by doing meditation and penance.
Lataji: Yes, I think that my parents have blessings and listeners have blessings.
I am nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, today it is your humility, it is a great education for all of our new generations.
Its a very big inspiration for us that despite all the clearances made in the life given to us, it has always given priority to the values and humility of your parents.
Lataji: G.
And I am glad that when you proudly said that your mother was Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, Mr. Modi ji gave me something Gujarati.
I know that your visit is changing the picture of India and I am very happy with it.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see how busy you are and how much work you are doing.
What is required to be considered
When you visited and touched your mother's feet, I also sent someone to see them and took their blessings.
Modi ji: Yes.
My father was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It will be my good fortune.
Modi ji: Pranam Didi.
Lataji: My best wishes to you.
Modi ji: Pranam G.
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again fill with new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new resolve.
Festivals are the occasions of N.
By the next several weeks, festivals will be thrilling across the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this word is not just a word, it is an order for all of us, it is a philosophy and an inspiration.
In some households, sweets get spoilt, in some households, children sweeten for sweets.
This is the light of Diu.
The real pleasure of these festivals is when it is dark and it is lightening.
We should also share happiness where there is a lack of happiness and also our nature.
Let us also think of providing sweets, clothes and gifts to each other in our homes where delivery takes place.
At least, we don't use anything in our homes, we don't need to share such things in others.
In many cities, the start-ups of the young friends of several NGs are doing such a thing.
They collect clothing, sweets, snacks, bouquets and everything from their homes and find the needy and reach them and secretly do the same.
Can we eradicate the darkness of this diwa with full awareness and determination in this festival of festivals
Smiling on the faces of several poor families will double your happiness on the festivals. Your face will glow.
Your lamps will become more illuminated and your lamps will become more illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmiji's house comes to Deepawali in the form of good fortune and prosperity.
Lakshmi ji is traditionally welcomed.
Can we keep this time in our society, in our villages, in our cities and in our cities for the honour of our daughters
Can we have public programmes
There will be a lot of daughters among us who will be bringing laurels for the family, society and the country with their talent and hard work.
Can we programme the honour of this Laxmi on this Diwali
There will be several daughters and daughters around us who will be doing extraordinary work.
If someone is engaged in spreading awareness about hygiene and health then some doctor will be serving the society as an engineer.
Being a lawyer, he must have been trying to bring justice to someone.
Our society should identify, honour and take pride in these daughters.
Their respect programmes should be organized across the country.
Promotion of Lakshmi of India means paving the way for prosperity for the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that Mann Ki Baat has a huge advantage that I got the good opportunity to have a direct interaction with a large number of ignorant people.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when the results of my examination came, some people asked me to read the Exam Warriors book.
I have not read this book.
But after returning, I read this book and read it twice or thrice.
My experience in this regard has been very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before examination, I would have got a lot of benefits.
My little student friend, thank you for writing this letter first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take time for a new revolt then I will definitely try to write something for my parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share their experiences on the aspects related to stressless examinations.
So I will wait for your thoughts.
Once again I express my gratitude to our younger friend, student Alina Taigu of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through newspapers and TV.
But you know that I too consider it as a common man just like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and that is why the impact of things that have been affected in a normal life also affects my mind because I too have come from amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he was awarded the Grand Slame Winner and the memorial of tennis Rafael Nadal to the finals.
The audience there warmly welcomed their talks.
Despite being defeated in difficult challenges, he praised his rival Nadal and gave a living example of sportsmanship.
On the other hand, however, the winner Nadale also praised the Daniel Games.
The passion and humility of the winners were both worth seeing.
If you have not listened to the statement of Daniel Medvedev then I will tell you, especially the youngsters, that you must see this video.
The thinking of our ancestors is indeed commendable.
We say in the scriptures: i.e., when a person has a combination of eligibility and humility, then who cannot win the heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about now is being done for your well-being.
The debate will continue, the party will continue to run, but if some things are stopped even before it gets increased then it will be of great benefit.
It is very difficult to stop things that are very high and are very widespread.
However, if we get awakened in the beginning, we can save a lot.
My heart says that with this feeling, I would especially like to talk to young friends today.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
This is what everyone says.
Tobacco intoxication is due to nicotine present in it.
The development of brain is also affected by its consumption in adolescence .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in India recently.
E-cigarettes are a kind of electronic device different from normal cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, nicotine is used to heat nicotine substances and create a chemical strain.
We understand the dangers of ordinary cigarettes very well, but a misconception has been created about e-cigarettes.
There is a misunderstanding that there is no threat to e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals were obtained so that it does not spread foul like the rest of the cigarettes.
We have seen around us that even if there is a father-chain smoker in the house, he stops the rest of the household from smoking, he wants his children not to have cigarettes.
It is their endeavour to ensure that no member of the family does not smoke or smokes.
They know that smoking and tobacco causes huge harm to the body.
The drinkers also know and the visitors also know.
But the issue of e-cigarettes is very different.
There is not much awareness among the people about e-cigarettes.
Sometimes the e-cigarettes quietly enter the house and sometimes the magic shows and the children keep on showing each other.
Look, I am going to smoke out of my mouth. See, without fire, without fire, without fire, I am going to smoke.
Once the adolescents and youngsters of the house get stuck in their clutches, then gradually they become addicted to this addiction and become victims of this evil addiction.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are obtained in the e-cigarette, which have a bad effect on health.
You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we are aware of it.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in its pocket, it is known by smell.
However, this is not the case with e-cigarettes. Many youngsters and youngsters are very proud to know and sometimes roam in their books, in their offices, in their pockets and in their pockets with pride in the form of fashion statements and sometimes they become victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that this new drug addiction will not ruin our young country.
The dreams of every family should not be wasted, the lives of children should not be wasted.
This disease, this habit should not be rooted in the society.
I urge you all to quit tobacco addiction and do not keep any illusion regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us together build a healthy India.
We have to avoid all this for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for all of us that India has been the birthplace and workplace of such exceptional people who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of others and not for themselves.
This is our Mother India, this is a multi-faceted country.
Many humans emerge from this land.
India has been the land of birth and workplace of such exceptional people.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves for others, not for themselves.
A similar detail is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will proclaim Marim Thresia as a saint on October 13.
The work that Sister Marriage Thesis has done for the betterment of humanity in the short span of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever work Sister Thresia did, it was completed with dedication and commitment.
He is still leading his lifestyle and mission.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating 150 then 130 crore Indians have pledged to free themselves from single use plastic.
Today, the eyes of all the countries are enshrined in India by the kind of leadership that India has taken in the direction of environment conservation.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
People have been contributing to this movement in their own way.
However, we have launched a very unique campaign for the youngsters of our country.
When I noticed his work, I talked to him on phone and tried to know about this new experiment.
It may be that these things are used by other people of the country.
Mr. Ripudhan Belvi ji is doing a great job.
For the first time when I heard the ploging words then it was new to me as well.
Perhaps that word has been used in a few ways abroad.
But in India, Ripudhan Belvi ji has very much publicised it.
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing the Fit India Plogging Run.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudhan ji on how this programme should be done and what is happening in the programme.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then our India will take 130 crore steps to get rid of single use plastic.
Once again, many-many thanks to Ripudhan ji.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into national interest.
One thing is a desire to be remembered early.
However, I will certainly do this in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, but today I am telling you from the beginning so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in lakhs of villages of India, children, elderly, all people, schools, colleges, thousands of people.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that by 2022, you will go to 15 places in India.
At least 15 places and if that happens then plan to stay for one night or two nights.
You see, understand and experience India.
What kind of diversity we have, and when this festival of Deepawali comes to the fore, people definitely go and I will reiterate that you must visit any 15 such places in India.
And how are these reforms
You would be happy to know that today our rankings are 34 and five years ago our ranks were 65 and in a way we have jumped a lot.
If we strive hard, by the time we complete 75 years of our independence, we will make our mark in the worlds premier destinations in tourism.
Yes, it is also important to see that in the days of Diwali, there will be no loss of any person in the fire due to cracks etc.
You must take all the precautions that should be taken for this.
Happiness, joy, enthusiasm and enthusiasm. Our festivals also bring a fragrance of collectivity and a culture of collectivity.
Collective life gives a new strength, it is a chapter of new strengths.
Come, let us celebrate festivals with enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolutions.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a short while ago, I had the opportunity to have an indirect interaction with the child friends of Karnataka.
Vijay Karnataka Akhbar of the Times Group called upon the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India.
And then he published some of them.
I read those letters, I felt very good.
These young children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
On a wide range of topics, these children have written, Kirti Hagde of North Kannada, proclaimed Digital India and Smart City schemes and suggested that we need to change our education system, he added, adding that nowadays children are not allowed to study in classrooms.
And if we acknowledge the nature of our children then perhaps it can be useful for us to move forward in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadaf from Lakshmeshwar has written that she is the daughter of an army soldier.
And he has said, I cant spend time with my friends as I am away from school, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
It was a good experience for me as well.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1944, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India on this day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whenever he reads these discussions, we feel proud that what is the idea of a dedicated life to the nation
Can you imagine how hard he has worked to create the Constitution of our country full of diversity
And that too at a time when the country was freed from slavery.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is the duty of all of us to create a New India keeping in mind the thoughts of those great men, the guides of the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very broad.
Perhaps there is no area of life, no subject of nature that it has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all are the hallmarks of our Constitution.
It protects the fundamental rights of every citizen, the poor, the Dalits, the backward, the deprived, the tribals and women.
And keeps their interests safe.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in letter and spirit.
Be it citizen or administrator, move forward in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
Seventy different Committees were constituted on key themes in the Constituent Assembly.
One of the most important Committees was the Committee on Importance and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, the Constitution of India that we feel proud of is an infinite symbol of Babasaheb Ambedkar's skilled leadership.
He ensured that every section of the society is well-being.
On his Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December, we salute him by remembering him as Kayam.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on his death anniversary on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, who was a iron man from the Kisanputra, had done extraordinary work to build the nation.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day, but how can the country forget the terror attacks on Mumbai on 26-11, nine years ago
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism has become a terrible form of everyday occurrence in every part of the world and in a way.
We have been tolerating terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
There were several people in the world who were not prepared to take it seriously but today when terrorism is staging its own doorsteps then every government in the world is looking at terrorism as a major challenge for those governments who believe in humanism and those who believe in democracy.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
It is going to destroy humanitarian forces.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world together have to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, this is the mantra of this land that has given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and radicalization are making a naked effort to distinguish our social oppression by weakening them.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to be more conscious of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December we will celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy protects and protects our coastal areas.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all are well aware that our civilization is beside the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu or Ganga or Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are both economic and strategic.
It is our gateway to the old world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with the oceans.
And when we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the Chaulanevi-Chaulnaukal was considered one of the most powerful naval forces during the Chaul Vanshi.
In the expansion of the Chaul empire, it was a very big part of his navy in making it an economic super power of that time.
A lot of liberalizations are still available in the Sangam literature.
Very few people would be aware of the fact that women were granted permission for long term warships in most of the naval forces in the world.
But in the fourteenth century and eight hundred and ninety years ago, women played an important role in a very large number and even women were involved in the war.
The Chaul rulers had a rich knowledge of building ships and building ships.
When we talk of the Navy, who can forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy
The coastal areas of Konkan, where the beaches are of immense significance, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts related to Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the coast or were surrounded by the sea.
The Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
There was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Marine Navy.
Their naval personnel were very skilled in attacking and escaping any enemy.
And when we talk about the Marine Arms, how can Kanoji remember the Angre
He took the Marine Navy to a new height, and set up camps of Marine Navy personnel at many places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its valour at different times.
Whether it is the freedom struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan war of 11.
In May-June this year, when there was a severe flood situation in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped the government and its people.
In the month of September last year in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS Gadhwal also provided humanitarian assistance in the matter of Rohingya.
In June last year, when the Papua-Nugini government sent us Takshid messages and requested us to save the fishermen of their fishing boats, our navy helped us.
On the 21st of December, a merchant ship in the western Akhara had also arrived to assist the INS Trikand in evacuating the ship from the antagonists.
Our navy has always been taking pride in delivering healthcare services to the island of Fiji, providing immediate relief to the neighbouring country.
We, the Indians, have always respected and respected our defence forces, be it the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, every Indian salutes the bravery, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
The youngsters sacrifice their lives for the country because they can lead the lives of millions and millions of our countrymen.
Every year we celebrate the 7th December as the Armed Forces Flag Day.
This is the day to express our pride and respect for the armed forces of the country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December to reach out to the citizens of the country and make people aware about the Armed Forces.
After the whole week all the youngsters put this flag on the chest .
A movement of respect for the army starts in the country.
We can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces on this occasion.
You can post the experiences of those who are associated with the Armed Forces in your surroundings with your recognition, video and photos associated with them along with armedforcesflagday.
You can get information about the army from them by calling upon the army personnel in schools, colleges and armed forces.
Our new generation can have a good opportunity to get acknowledged about the army.
This celebration also provides an opportunity to raise funds for the welfare of all our armed forces.
The fund is being spent by the Sainik Welfare Board on their rehabilitation for the welfare of the families of martyrs and wounded soldiers.
Let us do something on this occasion, so that our armed forces are strengthened.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
An important part of the earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire grain is connected to the soil.
Even if we think that there is no land or plant, then what would be possible for human life
This is the reason why we have been aware of the importance of our land since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a simple effort towards farming, towards soil, towards devotion and respect, on the other hand, scientific methods that are being nurtured by this land have been a part of our lives.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, both are important, in which devotion to their land as well as scientific conservation of land has been done.
I had heard about the farmers of Tohu village in Bhoranj taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Farmers there used to use basic chemical fertilizers and fertilizers and due to this the health of their land was ruined.
The yield was declining and consequently the income was declining and the productivity of the land was also declining.
Some of the farmers of the village understood the seriousness of the situation and subsequently they examined their land from time to time and advised them to use the fertilizers, fertilizers, micro nutrients and livelihood fertilizers.
You will also be surprised to know that what was the outcome of the schemes received by the farmers through land health and the guidance they received
These farmers have seen an increase of three to four times in wheat production in the Rabi 2016-17 season.
Our farmers across the country have created more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land better and can also make it unfair.
We worship the Mother Earth, however, a huge loss to the health of the mother earth due to chemical fertilizers like urea have you ever thought
All kinds of scientific experiments have proved that serious damage is caused by giving urea to mother Earth more than required.
This is the need of the hour to once again raise awareness about this mother tongue.
Can our farmers, our sons and sisters of our soil make a solemn pledge that the amount of urea they use today will half of it be used when it will be 75 years of independence in 2022
What kind of changes are being brought about in the lives of the farmers
We all are beginning to experience global warming and climate change.
There was a time when cold had started before Diwali.
Today December is knocking at twelve places and the cold is still slowly increasing.
However, as the cold begins, we all feel that it does not look good to get out of the jurisdiction.
But even in such a weather, people who are constantly aware of this can bring a beautiful result and this example is inspiring for all of us.
This little child Tushar has done inspiring work in spreading the message of cleanliness.
It shows that there is no age for cleanliness or there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for everyone.
And there is also a need to cook the corn for cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are determined.
In the meantime, we get to learn something.
Today he is doing well in every field.
Whether it is a field of sports or competition or a social initiative, our Divyangjans are not lagging behind.
You must remember that our Divyang players won four medals by performing well in the Rio Olympics and also made champions at the Blind Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several types of competitions across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country took part in it and showcased their skills.
He also won the Golden uadrilateral at the 70th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was chosen by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralympics Competition.
He is one of the 32 para-travelers who will be trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the passion of brother Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today, special attention is being paid to access and opportunity for Divyangjans.
It is our effort to empower every person of the country.
Building an inclusive society should enhance harmony in the society with equality and maternity and move forward together.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and I hope that this festival of Id gives us a new inspiration to enhance peace and harmony in society.
Forget sadness, and do not forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this thing.
We have been trying to recall several interesting events of the past year in the field of broadcasting.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year .
Remember others on such inspirational occasions.
If I recall good things then the feeling of doing good will be awakened, the mood will be created.
Good things give energy to improve.
And I will try to reach out to the people of our country in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, next month, I will be in your midst for Mann Ki Baat.
You will get a chance to talk a lot.
2nd October, 2019 on All India Radio
Six days after Diwali, the Mahaparv Chhath is one of the most relevant festivals in our country.
Traditional rules are adhered to in everything ranging from food to dress.
The unparalleled festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with nature and the worship of nature .
Sun and water are at the centre of the worship of Mahaparva Chhath, while bamboo and earthen utensils and sandalwood are incomparable materials associated with its worship.
The message of worship of the rising sun and the setting sun in this great festival of faith is full of unique culture.
This festival also has an important expression of cleanliness in our lives.
Before Chhath, the entire house is cleaned, along with the rivers, ponds, on the banks of Pokhar, that is, the place of worship, that is, the cleanliness of the valley, all the people are connected with the entire zeal.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Normally, people believe in accepting something but in Chhath Puja, there has been a special tradition of asking for prasad after lunch.
Behind this tradition of asking for prasad, it is also recognised that it destroys ego.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be praised and criticised.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief becomes firm that Mann Ki Baat with the people of this country is tied to a hundred percent unbreakable relationship.
Take the example of Khadi and Handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been a lawyer for handlooms, for Khadi and what is the outcome of it
You must have been pleased to hear that Khadi and Handloom are being sold at the same store.
During the Diwali, Khadi Gift Coupons sales have registered a growth of about 680.
Cumulative sales of Khadi and Handicrafts have seen an increase of nearly 70 this year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine that this will benefit many weaver families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by changing the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role for the rural people.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi app that he wants to know about the experience of my Diwali with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces believe in Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaekwade has also written on Narendra Modi App. Why can there be arrangements for our household to reach the sweet security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our household sweets should reach the soldiers of the country.
You all must have celebrated Diwali with great joy.
For me Diwali has also brought a special experience this time too.
Once again I had the privilege of celebrating Diwali with our brave security forces on the border.
This time it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every soldier of our security forces from every countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces defend the country by facing the difficult and odd situations on the border.
Whenever we get an opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their glorious stories.
Many of us are unaware that the soldiers of our security forces are playing an important role in maintaining peace not only on our borders but all over the world.
As UN Peace Ambassador, he is naming India in the world.
Recently, on 24th October, UN Day was celebrated across the world.
Everyone remembers the positive role played by the UN in world peacekeeping efforts.
And we believe that the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the UN since its inception.
You must be aware that the resolution of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with the words WE THE PEOPLE.
India has always emphasized on women's equality and UN DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS is a living evidence.
The proposal made in its preliminary framework was 'All men are borne free and equal' which was replaced by the efforts of the representative of India, Hansa Mehta and was later accepted by All Human Beings are burn free and equal.
Though this seems to be a very small change, but a healthy idea is seen in it.
There will be many of your mothers who will be receiving this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served in UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS.
Currently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PEACEKEPING INITIATIVES and are the third largest in the world.
By August 2019, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 OPERATIONS out of the worldwide 1 PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS of the UN.
OPERATIONS operates in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, and in many parts of the world.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated and rescued in the Indian Army Hospital in Congo and South Sudan.
India's security forces have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by doing People Friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peacekeeping operations.
Very few people would be aware that India was the first country to send Female Police Unit to the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Liberia.
And see, this step of India has become an inspiration for countries all over the world.
And then all the countries started sending their own Women Police Unit.
It will be a matter of pride to hear you that India's role is not limited to only the Peacekeeping Operating Operators, but India also works to impart training to the Peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas.
People have to live in different parts of the country.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to adapt themselves to the local needs and environment there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who have made a unique identity in Cyprus.
At the age of two years in 1988, he was made a Force Commander for Operation in Namibia and he provided his services for ensuring freedom of the country.
General Thimaya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and unanimously laid the foundation of peace.
As a peace ambassador, India has always been sending a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
We believe that everyone lives in peace, harmony and moves towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land has been adorned with great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister statement, which we call Bhagwani statement, was also one of those extraordinary people.
He was born in Ireland as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of statement.
And the meaning of statement is that which is completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself in accordance with his name.
Yesterday was the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Sister Statement.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy and prosperous life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
The Sister Statement was deeply saddened by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
Not only did the British make our country a slave but they also tried to make us mentally slaves.
This work continued to be done by undermining our culture and creating a feeling of indifference.
Bhagni Niveditaji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
Awareness of national consciousness has worked towards uniting people.
He went to different countries of the world and raised his voice against the evil propaganda about the eternal religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati is famous for her revolutionary poem Pudumui Pen, New Women and women empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was Bhagwani's statement.
Bhagni Nivedita ji also supported the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped publish and disseminate bus research through his writings and conferences.
It is this special beauty of India that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Bhagni's statement and scientific Jagdishchandra Bus is a strong example of this.
In 1988, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people died at the scene.
Bhagini's statement started the work of cleaning the nick and roads without worrying about her health.
She was a woman who could lead a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifices, people looked at him in service.
He spoke of the importance of cleanliness and service to the people through his work.
And it has been written on his monument - "Here Repose Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India" - is resting here in Bhagwan's statement which has dedicated her all to India.
He undoubtedly did the same.
There cannot be any other worthy tribute to this great personality today that every Indian should take inspiration from his life and strive to follow that path of service.
First of all, on the occasion of birth anniversary of our first elder Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, I convey my best wishes to all the children on Childrens Day.
Children are the most important diamonds for building a New India.
Your concern is true that earlier the diseases that used to take place at a very old age and the last stages of life are now being seen in the children as well.
It is very surprising today when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases were rarely happening among the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for suffering from such a disease in our youth is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the change in our food habits.
Society and family need to pay attention to this.
When they think about it, you see that there is no need to make any difference.
It is necessary that we keep changing our habits by doing the small things properly and regularly and make it a habit.
I would like that my family members should try to adopt the habit of going to the open ground.
If possible, the elders of our family should also play with these children in the open.
Transfer of bed straw to children instead of coming up on the lift.
After dinner the entire family moves with the children and walks a little .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will especially help our young friends to maintain a healthy lifestyle and save them from lifestyle disorders.
Thirty minutes before going to school, see how beneficial it is.
You can do the same thing at home as well as the specialty of Yoga - it is easy, easy and accessible. And I can say that people of any age can do it easily.
Several studies are being conducted to know how Yoga is effective in controlling diabetes.
It is being studied in AIIMS as well and the results that have been achieved so far are very encouraging.
We should not only make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives as a means of treatment and treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the field of sports in the past.
Our sportspersons have brought laurels for our country in different sports.
India has won the Asia Cup hockey in hockey.
Our sportspersons have performed excellently and with this, India has become the Asia Cup champion ten years later.
India had earlier become the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2003.
My best wishes to the entire team and helpful staff on behalf of my countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has come to India in the badminton as well.
BADMINT STAR KIDAMBI SHRIKANT has made every Indian proud by winning the Danish Open Prize.
This is his third super-series premiere title after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA U-1 World Cup was organised this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their respect on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm amongst the players and viewers.
The whole world is watching you on such a big occasion of the World Cup...
I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm and sentiment of all the young players.
The World Cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
However, India could not win but the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The entire world, including India, acknowledged the sports festivities and the entire competition was interesting and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright, its signs are visible.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, as many people write to me about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then I will have to organize Mann Ki Baat programme everyday and I will have to dedicate Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
Sometimes it is a matter of collective endeavours of the youth.
Somewhere there is an innovation about cleanliness or news about the changes that have been brought about by the people of an officer.
In the past, I have received a very detailed report about the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGs, called the Ecological Protection Organization, carried out the cleanliness drive of the Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me photographs of the fort before cleanliness and after sanitation.
I was stunned to see the photographs. And I would like to tell the photographers that they are depressed to see the filth around themselves. Sometimes they feel that if the dream of cleanliness is fulfilled then I would like to tell them that you can see the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization, their sweat, their zeal and your determination in the lively pictures.
Your despair will be transformed as soon as you see it.
This gracious effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collectivity and consistency.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all of us to keep our historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
He spoke of the well-being of the entire mankind, and described all species as one.
He emphasized on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and during his visit he gave the message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, and showed them the path of honesty, sacrifice and dedication.
He conveyed the message of equality in society and showed this message not only through words but also through his actions.
He ran anchor, which generated serving in the people.
The feeling of unity and equality among the people was awakened by sitting and taking anchor.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of a meaningful life - Memorise the name of God, work hard and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji had also created Gurbani to say his words.
Next year in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us strive to take the path of their message and teachings forward.
My dear countrymen, two days later on 31st October we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
We all know that he had laid the foundation of a modern Integrated India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only gave a transformational idea but was also skilled in finding practical solutions to a very difficult problem to demonstrate.
He had a glimpse of the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took the privilege of binding India together.
He ensured that crores of Indians are brought under the guise of One Nation and One Constitution.
Their decision-making ability enabled them to overcome all obstacles.
Wherever there was a need for honour and respect, he used force wherever there was a need to use force.
He said that there cannot be any discrimination between caste and creed, all the sons and daughters of India, all of us should love our country and build our trust in mutual love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for our vision of a New India.
And this is the reason that his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution in transforming the country into an integral nation is incomparable.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity will be organized across the country on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, which will include children, youth, women, all age groups from all over the country.
I urge you all to participate in the Run for Unity - this festival of mutual goodwill.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali holidays, with a new resolution, with a new determination, all of you have once again joined your everyday life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani and today it is the 36th episode.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country reach me, perhaps I can say very little things to you but I get a lot of trouble.
Most of them inspire me.
Many of them are for reforms in the government.
Sometimes there are personal grievances and sometimes attention is drawn towards the community problem.
And I take you half an hour a month but people talk about Mann Ki Baat on thirty-four days.
And as a result, it is easy to understand the sensitivity of the government and how far-flung societies have been created.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity that I have got to know about the feelings of the common man of the country.
And I am confident that this thought-provoking will be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future. It will provide a new consciousness and a new energy.
Once I had told Mann Ki Baat that we should worry while eating or take as much as we need, we should not waste it.
But after that I saw that all the letters from every nook and corner of the country have come to me and several social organizations and many youngsters have already been doing this thing.
Several people who worked on the way food was left out in the plateau and how it should be utilised so that I felt very happy and very happy.
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw a selfie with daughter from a Sarpanch of Haryana and I talked to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
In view of this, not only in India but also in the whole world, a massive campaign of selfie with daughter has been launched.
This is not just a social media issue.
This is a new confidence in every girl child and it is a new event of pride.
Every parent felt that I too should take selfies with my daughter.
Every girl felt that I had some significance.
In the past, I had met with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
When I told the people visiting the tour that wherever you go, you sent a photo of Incredible India.
Millions of printers from every corner of India, in a way, have become a big honour for those working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this thing in Mann Ki Baat that how big a movement starts from the smallest of us.
Today I felt like saying all these things because when I was wondering that three years have passed then several incidents of the last three years have come to my mind.
The country is constantly moving in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the other, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country. In my three year Mann Ki Baat campaign, I have learnt, understood and understood from my countrymen.
It is a huge capital for any country, it is a huge power.
I heartily salute the countrymen.
The feeling that Khadi's attraction has increased in the younger generation, be it the roof of the house or be it the bedroom or be it the bedroom or bedroom or bedroom.
Khadi's sales have increased and this has led to direct employment in the houses of the poor.
From 2nd October Khadi is discounted and many discounts are granted.
Once again I would urge you to carry forward the mission of Khadi.
We should work with that feeling that the poorest of the poor should have Diwali lamps by procuring Khadi.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And because of the increase in interest towards Khadi, the government of India has encouraged the people working in the Khadi sector to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to bring solar power
How can we revive the old heritage that had been closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years
In Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
A variety of activities were added.
New employment opportunities have been created for many people.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed their closed training centres and Kashmir has a lot to offer in this area.
Now because of the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be able to provide a new help in the construction of modern infrastructure, in the construction of new things and in the construction of new things. And I feel very good that even the big corporate houses will be able to provide the gifts on Diwali.
People have also started giving Khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all feel how things move forward with a comfortable spirit.
My dear countrymen, last month we all made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat and we decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti we will celebrate the festival of cleanliness across the country.
We will connect people to cleanliness.
Our Honble President started this work and the country got connected.
Whether it is children, old people, men or women, cities or villages, everyone has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
And when I say that Sankalp se Siddhi, this cleanliness drive is progressing towards a solemn pledge, we are seeing it before our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, supports it and contributes to it.
This time we have seen one thing - one thing is that we should clean up somewhere, the other is that we should not waste by being aware but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then an ideal movement is also necessary.
This time, several competitions were held with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the Swachhta essay competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness is concerned, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of media.
We can see the country's electronic media, how much print media can serve the country. We can see it in the 'Swachhata Hi Seva' movement.
Just a few days back, somebody noticed me about the 18-year-old Bal Dar of Srinagar.
And you will be happy to know that Srinagar Nagar Nigam has created its Brand Ambassador for cleanliness and when it comes to Brand Ambassador, you will feel that perhaps he will be a cinema artist, perhaps he will be a sportsperson.
Bill Dar has been involved in Swachhata for the past 5-6 years since the age of 12-13 years.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, where plastic, polythene, used bottle and waste keep cleaning it.
Some of them are also earning.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age but he also linked his life to cleanliness.
I would also like to congratulate Srinagar Nagar Nigam for his initiative towards cleanliness and his imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India feels like going to Srinagar and it is a big thing to get so much energy there.
And I am glad that he not only created Brand Ambassador but this time he has given the car to Bilal and he has also trained people in other areas for cleanliness, he has inspired people and is lagging behind till the results are achieved.
Bill Dar is a small age but it is a source of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month for us to remember many great men.
These dignitaries gave us the direction, leadership and guidance for the 20th and 21st centuries and suffered a lot for the country.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji is the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 11th October and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji on 25th September.
It is also a centenary year for Nanaji and Deendayal Ji.
And what was the central point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and it was that living for the country, doing something for the country and not just teachings but also guiding the people through its conduct in his life.
Gandhiji, Jayaprakash ji and Deendayal ji are all such great men who kept away from the shackles of power but kept on living with the people and kept on doing something for the welfare of the people.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left his political life and was engaged in rural areas. And today when we celebrate his centenary year then it is very natural to have respect for the work of his village.
Former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji used to talk to the youth about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He used to mention it with great respect and he himself went to the village to see Nanaji's work.
Remembering all these great men is not good for them. Remembering these great men so that we get the path ahead and get the direction ahead.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will surely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but the Run for Unity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme is scheduled to be held across the country on October 31.
In every city of the country, there should be massive Run for Unity programmes in every city and this season is also such that it is necessary to get iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also move ahead with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We say in a very natural way - unity in diversity, India's specialty.
We take pride in diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will repeatedly tell my countrymen of India and especially to my younger generation that we are in a state of consciousness.
Let us feel the diversity of India, touch them, experience their fragrance.
You see, even for the development of your personality, these diversities of our country work as a very big school.
There are vacations, Diwali days, there is a tendency to visit somewhere in our country, people go as migrants and it is very natural.
However, sometimes there is a concern that we dont see our country, we dont know the diversity of the country, we dont understand it but we have started selecting foreign tourism by coming under the influence of Jhakjmal.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any restrictions, but sometimes look at your homes.
The people of North India do not know what is in South India
The people of western India do not know what is in Eastern India.
Our country is full of diversity.
All these great men made a wide range of India.
At the outset of his work, he tried to understand India.
He tried to make India live within himself.
Can we try to make different states, different societies, groups, their traditions, their dresses, their food habits, their beliefs as a student
Value editions will take place in tourism only when we try to consolidate them as a student and not just a visit.
I have my own experience that I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of India.
There will be more than four and a half districts where I would have got the opportunity to leapfrog. And today when I am assuming this responsibility in India, the experience of this tour is very useful for me.
It is very convenient to understand things.
I also urge you to feel the storehouse of the immense strength of our vast India while speaking the formula of unity in diversity.
This includes the dream of Ek Bharat-Buddha Bharat.
There are so many diversities of food.
Even if life is eating a different food everyday then no food habits will ever be repeated .
This is the strength of our tourism.
Inculcate the diversity of Kotikoti.
These experiences will enrich your lives.
Your thoughts will expand.
And who can be a big teacher with experience
Generally, the period from October to March is mostly of tourism.
People go on tour.
I am sure that if you go this time too, you will carry forward this mission.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photos.
You must send your photo on Incredible India.
If you want to meet the people of the city, not just the buildings, then you should also send the pictures.
Write not only about natural beauty but also about the lives of the people there.
Write good essays on your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about it
You see, if all the people of a state are talking about this thing then I would say in the government that it should be corrected and prepare a publicity literature on the seven things that have come up about every state.
That is, in a way, my aim is to promote tourist destinations from the point of view of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an important role in increasing the tourism of the country using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, a lot of things touch me.
It motivates my heart.
I leave a deep impression on my mind.
In fact, I am a person like you.
We have seen a unique example of women power and patriotism.
We can imagine that at this young age when the world has descended then how will they have a mental state .
For 11 months, he worked hard and trained and dedicated his life to fulfil his husbands dreams.
Likewise, NIDHI Dubey's husband, Kesh Dubey, used to work as a hero in the army and was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided to join the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to respect our maternal strength, our heroes.
I congratulate both the sisters from the bottom of my heart.
He has given a new inspiration and a new consciousness to the crores of people of the country.
Congratulations to both of these sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a huge opportunity for the young generation of our country between Navratri festival and Diwali.
We are hosting the World Cup of FIFA UNDER 19.
I am confident that a football will spread all around.
Every generation's juice will grow in football.
There should not be any school or college ground in India where our youngsters are not sporting.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the entire world is playing on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, a Navratri festival is going on.
There is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere is full of pure fragrance.
There is a spiritual atmosphere all around, the atmosphere of festivals, the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is considered to be a festival of means of energy.
It is known as Shardiya Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Maa Shakti that our country should scale new heights to fulfil the aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country gets the strength to face every challenge.
When the country progresses at a rapid pace and 75 years of India's independence in 2022 then the effort to fulfil the dreams of those who are striving for freedom should be the resolutions of the millions and millions of people, we should come out with a rod map of five years to fulfil that resolve with untiring hard work and untiring males.
My best wishes to you all.
Festivals, enthusiasm and enthusiasm are also increasing.
Mann Ki Aug 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand it is natural for the country to have anxiety when violence is detected from any corner of India.
This country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is a country of Sardar Patel who has given full strength to the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have adopted the values of public life, non-violence, equal respect and have embraced us in the future.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it sincerely.
I had also said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, even if it is a communal belief, whether it is faith in political ideology, whether it is faith in the person or the faith in the tradition.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, has every kind of system of justice for every person.
I want to assure the countrymen that this country will never tolerate those who take the laws and those who have laid down their lives in the wait for violence, whether they are a group or not.
Everyone will have to bow before the law, the law will decide the responsibilities and the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old, there should be cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions, perhaps there should be a day left in 365 days that we should not be associated with any festival there.
Now it must have been noted that every festival of ours runs in accordance with the timelines of nature.
It has a direct relationship with nature.
Our wealth festivals are directly related to the farmers and the fishermen.
Today, when I talk about festivals then first of all I would like to call you sweetheartedly.
Yesterday, the festival of Samvatsari was celebrated in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the month of Bhadrava is celebrated as a festival of festivals.
The last day of the festival is Sanskrit.
This is a really wonderful tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way, it is also called the festival of forgiveness and on this day it is a tradition of calling each other sweetness.
In his play The Merchant of Venice, the journal has written, Mercy is two blessings, It blesses him with gifts and him that means forgiveness and those who have been forgiven get the blessings of God.
Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years ago, before independence, he became a symbol of freedom movement.
And since independence, he had become a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is going on for 10 days.
This Mahaparv is said to be a symbol of unity, equality and integrity.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to every Indian.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam, one of the colourful festivals of India, is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival not only conveys the message of love and harmony in the society but also gives new zeal, new hope and new faith to the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism attraction.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal, in a way, tourism has become an attraction.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what we can do in this direction.
A few days later, the festival of Id-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
Id-ul-uha greetings to every Indian.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and hygiene are associated with family life.
Cleanliness and hygiene are the focal points of the festivals.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to be a social mood.
The insistence on cleanliness publicly should not only be at home but in our entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country, there should be an integral part of cleanliness with those festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definition of becoming modern is changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new parameter, how much culture you are, how modern it is, how much modern your thought process is, a trick is also being used to know about it.
If it is against it, it is considered to be a bad thing in the society today.
And today I can see the result of this thing that during the Ganesh Festival, eco-friendly Ganesh Festival has been organised.
If you go out on the YouTube then the children in every household are making Ganesh ji, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Different types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
In a way, such an extensive training of environment consciousness has been seen in this Ganesh festival which has been fortunately seen earlier.
Media House is also training, inspiring and guiding a large number of eco-friendly Ganesh statues.
And as I said, our country is full of crores of vibrant minds.
And it feels very good when new innovations are known.
Someone has told me that there is a gentleman who himself is engineer, he has collected soil in a special way, he has combined it and trained people to make Ganesh ji.
And if the gas is discharged in the water then it takes one dollar of water and keeps it in it so that it melts in the water immediately.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And the positive consequences are visible.
The coverage of toilets has gone up from 3 to about 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water was reduced after the flood situation, so much waste was spread everywhere.
In such a scenario, the workers of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
All those who persecuted themselves came out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness was given by every worker of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind, an example inspiring everyone.
The dedication towards cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature, then where can our country reach
We should look for opportunities wherever there is an opportunity.
But let us all join.
Work together on the day of the holiday or on Sunday.
Go to the neighbourhood, to the nearby villages, but do it as a movement.
In, a section has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can name yourself and those families which have helped you.
Friends of my social media can run a constructive campaign and the work done in the virtual world can be a source of inspiration at the ground.
The Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi competition of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is a competition for you, a short film making competition, a painting competition.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no limit to age, no age-limit in them.
You can make short films with your mobile phones.
2-3 minute films that inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language and it can also be silent.
The participants who will participate in this competition and the best three will be selected, three will be on the district level and three will be awarded on the state level.
So I invite everyone to join you in this cleanliness drive.
Once again I would like to say that this time, on 2nd October, we will take a pledge to observe Gandhi Jayanti as Swachhta 2nd October and for this, from 15th September, we will take the mantra of Swachhata to every household.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Make yourself a partner in it by working hard.
See how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine.
You can imagine, after this 15-day cleanliness drive, on 2nd October, when we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, we will have a sacred joy in paying homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to specially accept the loan of all of you.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart that is why you people have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I want to express my gratitude because I want to accept the loan because lakhs of people from every corner of the country are connected with this programme.
The number of listeners is not only in crores but lakhs of people sometimes write to me, sometimes they send me messages, sometimes they send a message on the phone which is a big challenge for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your messages more than you look forward to listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we dont feel that we are wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Arna with Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my witnesses.
They are always trying to help the people, but I am worried about a habit.
I once went to the mall to shop with it.
He spent 20000 rupees comfortably for a sari and the auto-rickshaw that he had taken to go to the mall for a pizza was levied for a long time with the rickshaw driver for a long time.
Buy vegetables on the way while returning and save four-five rupees by refunding on every vegetable.
I felt very bad.
We have passed a big bill without asking the big ones and we have fought with our wage earning brothers and sisters for a few rupees.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, whenever we come in contact with a small shopkeeper or a vegetable seller or an auto rickshaw driver, whenever we come in contact with the people living with a hard work, we start sharing the feelings with them.
And whenever we go to a big restaurant to have a meal, we don't even see what we have written in the bill and we immediately withdraw the money.
Not only this, when we go to buy saris in the showroom, we dont feel at all, but we cannot remain without emotions with the poor.
Have we ever thought of what would have happened to the poor
The question for this is not about two-five rupees but it hurts the heart that you are poor and therefore you have doubts about its honesty.
There is no difference in your life by two-five rupees but have you ever imagined that this small habit of yours would have been a serious blow to your mind
Madam, I am grateful to you, I have given me a message by calling you to touch your heart.
I am confident that my countrymen too will leave them in need if they have a habit of dealing with the poor.
My dear young friends, on 2nd August, the entire nation celebrates as National Sports Day.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the great Hockey Player and Hockey Maj Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I am reminded of this because I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports is a part of our lives.
If we are counted among the younger countries of the world, then our youth should also be seen in the field of sports.
Physical fitness , mental alertness , personality enhancing , I understand what should be more than this .
Sports is in a way a huge herb of heart fairs.
Today, in the Computer Era, I want to warn that the playing field is even more important than that.
FIFA plays on the computer but sometimes even in the fields outside.
Crickets will be played on the computer but the joy of playing crickets under the sky in the open ground is something special .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and the mother used to ask- When will you come back
Today, the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, they start watching a cartoon movie in one corner or get stuck on a mobile game.
There was a time when the mother used to tell the child that when will you come and today it is the situation that the mother has to say that when will she go out
Friends, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has prepared a sports talent search portal to explore and disseminate sports talents where any child who has achieved some achievements in the field of sports across the country can upload his biodeta or video on the portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected select sportspersons.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world with this festival of sports and sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share my thoughts with the countrymen last week as a touching incident.
I got the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the Himalayas.
The enthusiasm and zeal of the six daughters of our country who have never had a relationship with the sea, inspires us all.
These six daughters will have to embark on a small boat INS Tarini to cross the sea.
This mission has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will return to India after months after travelling all over the world.
Sometimes 40-40 days will be spent in water and sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water.
Our six daughters, with the courage of the waves of the sea, and this is going to be the first event in the world.
Who would be the Indian who would not be proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire nation.
I will also make a separate arrangement for his experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read from that requirement because this is an adventurous story, a story of self-respect and I will be glad to convey the messages of those daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we all are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday.
He was the President but was presenting himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
The great scientist had told Albert Einstein - it is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
That is, awareness of creative emotions and enjoyment of knowledge among our students is the most important quality of a teacher.
This time, when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all make a solemn pledge
And in our country, when we talk of change, we remember the mother in the family as well as the teacher in the society.
Teachers have a big role to play in transformation.
There have been occasional incidents in the lives of every teacher that their simple efforts would have been successful in bringing about a change in their lives.
If we make collective efforts then we will play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come, let's take the mantra of Teach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
From the unfathomable.
I reside in Mumbai and work for India Research Centre in Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been the subject of discussions not only in India but also in the pundits of the economic world.
On 28th August, 2014, the mission started with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years on 28th August.
30 crore new families have been connected with it and bank accounts have been opened.
These figures are more than those of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that within three years, my poor brothers and sisters sitting at the last corner of the society have become a part of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started travelling in the bank, they have started saving money and they have been feeling the safety of money.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor, this is their strength in the days to come.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, those accounts that have been opened have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, one rupee, thirty rupees, a very ordinary premium today gives a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
In many families, due to insurance of one rupee, when a crisis arose on the poor, the lives of the mothers and sisters of the family came to an end, they got two lakh rupees in a few days.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana - be it Dalits, tribals, women, educated youth, youth with the intention to do something on their own, millions and millions of youngsters with the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, bank accounts without any guarantee.
Moreover, everyone has made a successful effort to provide employment to Ekad-Be.
A few days ago, the people of the bank met me, because of Jan Dhan Yojana, because of insurance, due to the Rupay card, they surveyed the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, and several inspiring cases came up for the public.
Today is not the time but I would like to tell the people of the bank that such cases are being addressed by MyGov.
They can inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
Changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment are having a very negative impact.
In the last few days, in some parts of India, especially in parts of Assam, Ishaan Bharat, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, some areas have faced natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
Areas affected by such floods are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a comprehensive level.
My cabinet colleagues are also reaching Rubu.
The State Governments are also making immense efforts to help the sufficient victims in their respective areas.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also making every effort to help people in such situations.
Whether it is the Indian Army, the Air Force, the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) personnel, the paramilitary forces, all of them join hands with the Dilo-Jan in serving the victims.
Due to floods, life becomes very frustrating.
NDRF teams were deployed.
They were made friends and trained what to do and what not to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared, so we have to learn to work in a difficult situation by forming a public organisation.
Gradually, we should also create a perception that according to the weather conditions, our activities should be organized so that we can avoid losses.
Whenever I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat, I see that more citizens of the country are getting ready than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have been received and all the phone calls have been received.
And people are still expressing happiness about GST and also expressing curiosity.
And I would like to share a phone call with you, Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I would like to say Nitu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day address, and was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched in our country on the same day last month.
Can you say that the results that the government had expected are being achieved after a month or not
I want to know your thoughts about this.
And when a poor person writes to me saying that GST has reduced the cost of living of the poor, and things have become cheaper then I feel extremely satisfied and happy.
Recently, I was seeing the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of trucks has increased.
How is it taking less time to cut the distance
Highways are free of traffic jams.
Earlier, as there were separate taxpayers, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector were used to keep working and they had to build new godowns in every state.
However, GST is what I call Good and Simple Tax.
It has indeed made a very positive impact on our economy and in a short span of time.
The speed at which simple changes have taken place, the speed at which new registrations have been made, has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, economists, management experts, technicians will present the GST experiments in the form of a model to the world.
This will be a case study for many universities of the world.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre in consensus.
And this is the result of this thing that every government has the same priority that there should not be any burden on the poor due to GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, to all the departments, to the Central and State Government employees involved in this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but also a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a mission of social reform.
Once again I salute crores of countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
Together, we have been listening to this thing since childhood and this is the reason why the Non-Cooperation Movement started on 1st August, 2019.
August, 1942, the uit India Movement was launched which is known as the August Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th August, the country was freed.
In a way, several incidents related to the freedom struggle in the month of August are particularly related.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people know that the slogan of uit India was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
From 185 to 1942, the way the people of our country kept connecting with you, struggled and endured, this history was our inspiration to build India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom movement.
The movement was pledged to liberate the entire nation from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian public opinion against the British power had become a part of the uit India Movement by joining hands in every corner of the country, be it villages, cities, educated people, poor people, emirs or harcourses.
Jan Akrosh was at its peak.
Millions of Indians were jumping their lives into the war with the mantra of Do or Die, at the feet of Mahatma Gandhi.
Millions of youth of the country had left their education and had sacrificed their books.
Hearing the bugle of freedom, he went out.
Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement on 9th August, but all the big leaders were thrown into jail by the British.
And it was during that period that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan had played a leading role in the country as the leader of the second generation.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement, two distinct forms of Mahatma Gandhi appear in 120 and 142.
The format of the Non-Cooperation Movement was different and the situation of the 42 was different. The pace was so high that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave a mantra of destruction.
This was the peoples support behind all these successes, peoples power.
It was a peoples resolve, a peoples struggle and the entire country was fighting together.
Sometimes I think that if we want to add a few pages of history then India's first freedom struggle was in 1985.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, continued till 1942, in some corner of the country.
During this long period, the hearts of our countrymen were filled with freedom.
Everyone is committed to something.
Generations changed but there was no dearth of resolutions.
People came, went together, moved, moved, moved, moved, newlyweds, newlyweds and the country was trying hard to break the British Sultanate.
This effort from 1985 to 1942 created this movement in such a situation that it reached the peak in 1942 and the desert of uit India Movement came to a standstill that the British had to go to 14 in five years.
From 1985 to 1942, the 5 years of 1942 to 1944, when it reached the people of the country, became such a people, with the determination to achieve independence, with the success of five decisive years.
This was a decisive five years.
Now I want to connect you with this calculation.
In 1947, we became independent today.
It has been almost 70 years since the governments came, the systems were changed, developed and everybody in their own way tried to free the country from the problems.
Similarly, there was a decisive five years of achievement from 142-14 resolutions.
I can see that from 2019 to 2022, a further five-year period from resolution to achievement has come before us.
We will celebrate the 15th of August, 2019 as a festival of resolutions and we will continue to fulfil this resolution when we complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores and crores of resolutions.
So, as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive for the country's independence, these five years could be decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
Come, let us run a great campaign of Sankalp se Siddhi from August in the month of August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local entities, schools, colleges, different organisations - take some resolutions for every New India.
A resolution that we will achieve in the next five years.
Today, I especially the online world because we may or may not be there, but the online must be there.
The online world and especially my young friends, I invite my young friends to come forward in an innovative way to contribute in building a New India.
Using technology, use of videos, posts, blogs, writing, innovative ideas.
Transform this zonal into a mass movement.
The Narendra Modi App will also launch the uit India quiz for young friends.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to familiarize them with the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must make a comprehensive publicity and spread it.
There he does not speak, the voice of 1. 25 billion Indians is echoing from the Red Fort.
This time too, I invite you to send me your thoughts on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
I myself read it and I will try to publish it in whatever time I have on 15th August.
During the last three years, I got to hear a complaint in my August 15 speech that my speech becomes a bit longer.
Whether success is achieved or not
Friends, I also want to say one thing.
There is a social economy in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just occasions of joy and joy.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a mission of social reform.
But with that, every festival of ours has a direct link in the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, the fourth moon after that, Anant Chaudas, Durga Puja, Diwali is one after the other and this is the right time when economic opportunities are available for the poor.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of families have started forming small enterprises in their homes.
Thousands of seconds of manufacturers, flour sellers and sweets are connected to a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs on it only.
Its not just a festival of light but it is not just a festival, a festival of household decoration.
It is directly related to the poor families who make small homes of the soil.
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen it and sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware than me and are more active.
For the last one month, the citizens who have been consistently conscious of the environment have written to me.
He has urged you to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi so that people can plan for soil genetics from today itself.
At the outset, I am grateful to such a vigilant citizen.
He has urged me to speak on this subject prematurely.
This time Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji initiated this great tradition and this year marks the 125th year of Ganesh Utsav.
Once again, let us recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak, let us make essays, let us hold discussions, let us recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak in this year's Ganesh festival.
And again in the spirit of Tilak ji, how should we take the Ganesh Festival in that direction, how should we strengthen that spirit and at the same time, we should make a solemn pledge to protect the environment by eco-friendly gems and soil-made genetics.
And this time I have said this thing very soon
I am sure you will associate yourself with me and it will be beneficial for us that our poor workers, the poor artists, the idol makers, the poor will get employment and the poor will get their stomach filled up.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, with the economy of the poor, with the joy of our festivals, with the economic festivals of the households of the poor, with economic joy.
I convey my best wishes to every citizen of the country for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we constantly see that our daughters are bringing laurels for the country, be it education sector, economic sector, social sector or sports.
We are proud of our daughters.
In recent days, our daughters have made a splendid performance at the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those daughters this week.
I felt very nice to talk to him but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win.
He had pressure on his face as well as stress.
We have seen many such sports that if a player of India fails then the anger of the country falls on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something that causes a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters were not able to succeed in the World Cup, 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their faces and the burden was not allowed to fall on those daughters.
Moreover, these daughters praised and glorified what they had done.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to illuminate the country.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to the young generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, I once again recall the August Revolution and once again remind you of August 15th August 2022, the 75th year of independence.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge and prepare a five-year roadmap for achieving this solemn pledge.
We all have to scale new heights, scale new heights and reach that country.
Let us move together, let us do something.
The future of the country will be better. Let us move ahead with that confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
In many parts of the country, the weather has become pleasant due to rains.
After the rains, the cold winds are relieved of the heat that has been lying in the past.
And we have seen that our mindset changes only when there are many problems in life, how much stress, personal life, public life and the arrival of rains.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is deeply respected and joyous in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
The people who have visited Dr.
He must have studied Babasaheb Ambedkar. He must have seen that he used to admire the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath as it included social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath ji is the God of the poor.
And very few people would be aware that there is a word in English, juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in this journal, it is also seen that this word has emerged along with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand that how the world has adopted this journey of Jagannath in its own right.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and bow down to Lord Jagannath ji.
India's diversity is also its specialty, India's diversity, which is also India's strength.
People of the holy month of Ramzan celebrated it with purity.
Now is the festival of Eid.
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to everyone.
The month of Ramzan is the month of virtue.
Happiness is a month of sharing and happiness grows as much as we share.
Let us collectively take inspiration from these sacred festivals and share the joyous traditions and take the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, an inspiring incident took place in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in small villages and in a way more than that of our brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to make toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, assistance is also provided from the government and an amount of about one lakh rupees has been given to them.
These 1 lakh rupees will be spent on other facilities in the village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for turning this sacred occasion of Ramzan into a good opportunity for the society.
One of their things is also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that they freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that there are three regions in our country - Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala - which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, administration and people of these five states for completing this work.
We are very well aware that we have to work hard to do something good in the life of a person, in the life of a society.
If our letter is bad, if we need to improve it then we have to remain very conscious for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
The subject of cleanliness is similar.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
It has become a part of our habits.
We have to constantly strive to get rid of it.
Everybody's attention has to be attracted.
We have to remember good inspirational incidents.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, a very good event came to my mind, which I would like to say to you.
The incident is from Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration there has taken up a big task with public participation.
100 hour non-stop drive
And what was the goal
10,000 household toilets in 1 gram panchayat in a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 village has been ODF.
I congratulate the people, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district for reaching out to the culmination of hard work and presenting a very inspiring example.
These days, in Mann Ki Baat, I continue to receive the message from the people, Narendra Modi continues to visit the app, Mygov.
They keep coming on the air, they keep on coming on the air, they keep coming on the air.
Recalling the crises, Shri Prakash Tripathi wrote that he has presented the 25th of June as a dark period in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi ji's awareness of democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was a dark night that no democratic loving person can ever forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into jail.
The opposition voice was pressed down.
Distinguished leaders of the country, including Jayprakash Narayan, were jailed.
The judicial system too could not escape the shadow of the catastrophe.
The newspapers were completely wasted.
Today's journalism, the students of the world, the people working in the democracy, they are repeated and constantly striving to raise awareness about democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
When the catastrophe took one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and he described the state of mind in his poetry.
We have to strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud to be heading the world today.
On 21st June, 2019, the entire world became Yoga.
From water to mountain people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practiced Yoga on The Great Wall of China in China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters above sea level on the World Heritage Sight Machu Picchu in Peru.
People performed Yoga at the Eiffel Tower in France.
More than 4,000 people performed mass yoga in UAE's Abu Dhabi.
India gave a new wait to Indias friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghanistan Friendship Dam- Salma Dam in Hairat, Afghanistan.
At a small place like Singapore, programmes were organised at 0 places and they continued for weeks.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters were organized at UN Headquarters.
UN officials, Ambassadors of the world, including everyone...
This time once again, Yoga has also worked as a World Record.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by practicing Yoga together in Ahmedabad.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I had the privilege of doing Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen, where there is 20, 25,40 degree Celsius.
Our Armed Forces, BSFs, ITBPs, CRPFs, CISF, all have made Yoga a part of their respective duties.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family should share photographs of Yoga.
Some TV channels also carried this forward.
I received several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister Shri, I am speaking to Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Sir, I have a question that we had heard in your speech in Kerala recently that instead of giving gifts and flowers bouquets we should give good reading books as mementos.
You have started this work in Gujarat during your tenure but, sir, we have not been able to see this work in a few days.
So can we do this
We are organised by the Bhimikar Foundation and reading day and reading month are observed so that people become aware of the habit of reading books and reading books.
For this, I got the opportunity to visit it on the occasion of its launch.
And Khadi's handloom, which also encourages Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, it became the habit of all of us, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But he went to Kerala and once again he remembered it.
And I have recently started giving the following instructions to the government.
We can gradually create a habitat.
And flower bouquets have a very low life expectancy.
Once we took it in our hands and then we left it behind.
But if a book is given then it becomes a part of the household, it becomes a part of the family.
Welcome to Khadi by handing over the tower, so many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is reduced and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am talking about this thing then how historic is the value of such things.
When I went to the UK last year, Rani Elizabeth, the queen of Britain, invited me to dinner in London.
For many years, ueen Elizabeth has kept the sufferings given by Mahatma Gandhi intact.
And when I was watching, he was urging me to touch and see.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that habits do not change overnight and when they talk about it then they also become victims of criticism.
However, there will be criticism but we will continue to talk about it and it will gradually change.
My dear countrymen, because of being the Prime Minister, many kinds of things happen.
I have to fall in the files but I have a habit of reading some of the letters that I receive every day and I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of letters come, different kinds of people write letters.
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I feel that I must tell you about it.
In the far south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arulmoji Sarwan, he sent me a letter.
And in a letter, he wrote that I had thought of doing something economic along with paying attention to the study of children in my family, which would provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took money from the bank through the MUDRA scheme and started a small work towards sending some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called the Government of India e-Marketplace.
So I found out about it and asked the people about it.
Then I myself registered it.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you get the opportunity, then you should also visit the e-GeM on the internet.
Those who want to send supply of goods to the government, want to send small items, they want to send electricity bulbs, they want to send a dustbin, they want to send a vessel, they want to send a chair, they want to send a table, they want to sell it.
They can write about the quality of goods they have, they can sell, they can write and the people of the government departments must visit the site on a compulsory basis.
And then they have to order.
Every department of the government looks after those who register their names within the e-GeM.
Due to non-stop intermediaries, the goods are very cheap.
Now the Arulmozhi Madam has registered all the goods that could be given on this website of the government.
And it is a matter of joy that the letter he has written to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got the money from MUDRA, my business started, I got all the information about what I could give within e-GeM and what I would have asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office has purchased two thermos from me.
And I got my bill of Rs. 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace- GeM.
I would definitely like those people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way that they can connect more and more with this site.
I believe that this Minimum Government and Maximum Governance (less than the Government of India) are a wonderful example of what its goal is to ensure minimum price and greater efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground related to Yoga, then our dreams are to overcome those horizons of distant respect.
A few days ago, India has worked hard in sports and science too.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 nano satellites with Cartoset-2 series satellites.
And this satellite includes 14 other countries of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA besides India.
And this nano-satellite mission of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the work of farmers, in times of natural calamities.
A few days ago, we all remembered that ISRO successfully launched GSAT-1.
And this is the most weighted satellite in the satellite launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country compare it with the weight of its elephants, you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the field of space.
One thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 1st June.
But I am glad that the strength of our scientists was that they have successfully completed six months and now even after a thousand days our Mangalyaan Mission is working.
Photos are being sent, information and scientific data are coming, they are working more than their age.
This is an important milestone in our scientific journey, in the journey of our space.
We also see that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
It is now visible that along with studies, our younger generation is witnessing its future in sports as well. And because of our sportspersons, because of their hard work and achievements, the country's name is also illuminated.
Recently, Indias badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth has enhanced the honour of the country by applauding his victory in the Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest greetings to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
I got the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics, Usha Ji.
Sports also plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in overall personality development is immense.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family is also interested in sports then they should be given the opportunity to play.
They should not be compelled to carry them out from the fields, they should not be compelled to books, they should also study and move forward. However, if they are interested in sports, they should be encouraged and encouraged by the school, college, family and the surrounding people.
Everyone should dream for the current Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of festivals and festivals, in a way, the experience of this period is new.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
Rainfall is awaiting sights.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are given a lot of importance.
We Indians are fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can take pride in this thing. We can take pride in the fact that all the sects of the world are present in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God, those who worship the idol and those who oppose the idol worship also live.
Every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living together and in the end, be it religion, communalism, philosophy or be it tradition or be it peace or unity or be it harmony.
The sacred month of Ramzan will surely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to everyone.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and specially told the youngsters to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences, and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way that it can take some risks and invite difficulties.
I am glad that many people have given me a befitting reply.
Personally, everyone showed me the courage to talk to me.
Some learn dramas and some people have written that we have started writing poems.
My reading habits were almost exhausted.
Therefore, I decided to study in these holidays.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle and sacrifice had to be made for India's independence, how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh who has done a lot in his young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to todays generation on this subject.
I am glad that the young generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men, who spent their youth in prisons, laughed and laughed in the hearts of many young fans.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
We must have seen that the great men who spent their time during the freedom movement did a great job of writing, studying and doing a great job.
I visited Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
The Cellular Jail was visited.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote Maji Janmath in jail.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were shut down in a small coat.
Imagine how those who seek freedom must have embarked upon them.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmath, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India that would not have spoken the language of India that had not laid down its youth in the Cellular Jail, the prison of Andaman for the sake of freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, every speaker of every language, every generation of the people of every region used to torture the British.
I would like to tell the youth of the country that what kind of evils the people had to face for the freedom that we had attained, what kind of hardships they had to face, if we go to the Cellular Jail then we will know.
Just after going there, it is known why it is called the punishment of black water, if you get the opportunity, you must visit that place as a pilgrimage to our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of 5th June is Monday.
Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, we should take care of the world that we do not want, we should also worry about it.
If you are tired and if you open the windows, open the doors and fill the air with fresh air then a new consciousness will emerge.
When this body of the five great personalities comes in contact with the Panch Mahabharata then a new consciousness emerges in our body and a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this thing but we dont recognise it, we dont connect it to a single thread, to a single thread.
After this, you must have noticed that when you are in touch with the natural condition, you will have a new consciousness within you. And therefore, the global mission to connect with nature on the 5th of June should also be our mission.
And we are getting some benefit from our ancestors for protecting the environment.
If we protect, our future generations will be benefitted.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the roots of strength.
And Atharvaveda is in a way the biggest guiding composition of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have in us is due to our planet.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is obvious that the birth of Lord Buddha, the attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had fallen under three trees.
But we need to link it with modern ways in modern words.
These days, I keep getting news from the states.
In almost every state, a massive mission of tree plantation is going on just after the rains.
Trees are grown in crores of numbers.
My dear countrymen, 21st June is now a day known for the world.
The entire world considers it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day is spread in every corner and it is connecting people.
On the one hand, while many forces of division are showing their distorted faces in the world, Yoga is a great gift of India to the world.
We have connected the world with Yoga.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to race, due to rising responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also happening in the younger generation.
Yoga has an important role to play in leading a stress-free life, while pursuing climate medicines and passing days.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
Thus, it is possible through Yoga to experience the journey of health through body, mind, thinking and conduct.
Just two days back, I have written to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga related events.
Gradually, the work will progress in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and I have been asked to appeal that three generations of the same family should join hands on the third International Yoga Day this time.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents, parents or daughters, all the three generations should do Yoga together and upload their pictures.
Yoga will get a new dimension if it is a combination of yesterday, today and tomorrow.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had run the Selfie with Doctor campaign, it was a very interesting experience.
These three generations of Yoga will certainly play a curiosity for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have about three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
The practice began today.
I will continue to post some or the other Yoga related posts on Twitter from June 1st and will continue to post them till 21st June.
I'll share with you.
You should also propagate Yoga for three weeks, spread it and connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of a preventive health career.
I invite all of you to join it.
Because I received a very interesting phone call and I didn't even think about it.
But I am grateful to him for the way he has taken this matter.
You will also be taken care of by this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am Naina, from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, on your call, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
Your zeal for cleanliness from the valleys of Kashi has now turned into a movement by taking inspiration from you.
Your fact is that wherever I go, the government system does the work of cleanliness but during these days there is a festival of cleanliness in the society as well.
Five days prior to my visit, seven days prior to my visit, ten days ago, several sanitation programmes are being organised.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how pleased I might be knowing this thing and how the country is taking care of it in a better way.
During my journey, the subject of cleanliness is linked. What can be a matter of greater happiness for me
There will be other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness will be a key factor.
This is also a joy and inspiration for any cleanliness lover.
I convey my best wishes to everyone who has helped in the cause of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion will spread a little romance.
I dont know whether I can do it or not.
Modi ji, before you visit, those who want to invite you, tell them, "Brother, what would be the level of cleanliness if you want to call me"
The thoughts seemed very good, but I have to think.
However, it is true that it should be started that other items will be better than gifts so that we can clean so many tons of waste and give it in a gift.
How many people will be able to stop us from getting bored.
How big will be the work of humanity
One thing I would like to say is that we should not consider the waste of garbage as waste. This is a wealth and a source.
Do not just look at it as garbage.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments and with the help of the citizens representatives of the cities, has decided to launch a massive mission of the West Management.
On the 5th of June, World Environment Day, solid waste and liquid waste will be available in about 4,000 cities of the country.
Two types of waste will be available, one green and the other blue.
Two types of waste are emitted - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we remain in discipline, in those four thousand cities where garbage is required, wet waste is put in blue waste and wet waste is dumped in green waste like vegetables, waste food, egg harvest or tree leaves, all these are wet waste and green waste.
This entire process is such that it can be used in the fields, it is green in the colour of the fields and if you keep in mind that what waste is required in the green waste material will be remembered.
And the rest of the waste like papers, cardboards, iron, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals, and many other incomplete things are called dry wastes which have to be recycled by putting them in the machine.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news that the Versova Bitch, which was considered dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful silver versova bitch today.
Its overall responsibility was taken over by the Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV).
I convey my best wishes to Mr.
I convey my best wishes to this movement.
And the way in which he connected the people of the entire region and converted them into a Jan Andolan is indeed an inspiring example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, months, whether it is newspapers, TVs or social media, all these are going on for the last three years of the present government.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Servant.
I see this process as a very positive indicator.
Each case has been assessed for a period of three years.
People from all walks of life have reviewed it.
This is a great process in democracy.
I obviously believe that governments should be responsible for democracy and people should give account of their work.
For a conscious nation, a conscious nation, this movement is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of everything is similar to that of a common man.
Mann Ki Baat looks like a one-sided dialogue, some people criticize it politically but after such a long experience, when I started Mann Ki Baat, I didn't think that Mann Ki Baat would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I sit at home in the midst of my family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me these things by writing.
And as I have said, as a common man, I have an impact on my mind.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Madam, everybody launched an analytical book Mann Ki Baat, as a person, as a citizen, this incident will give me a lot of enthusiasm.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, whenever I meet you, there must have been a rainstorm in every corner of the country, the weather has changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the start of a new life will be started from News and with the coming of rains, a new hustle-bustle and a new hustle-bustle will be created.
Come, let us move ahead with love and affection for nature in this environment.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Most of those who make suggestions or try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
And when it came to mind, I felt that these suggestions were not simple, they have come out of the clutches of experience.
I had never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of the fact that some social organisations have been working for years but the youth of my country are engaged in it.
How many have sent me away
There are several places where roti banks run.
People deposit roti on their behalf in this roti bank, they deposit vegetables and those who need it, they also get it from there.
Those who give satisfaction too, those who take it dont have to look down at it.
This is an example of how social cooperation works.
Today is the last day of the month of April.
The first day of May is the establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have relentlessly strived to scale new heights of development and contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when climate change was a subject of education, it was a subject of symposium, but today, in our daily lives, we experience it and express surprise.
Nature has also changed the rules of sports.
The summer of May-June in our country has come this time in March-April. And when I was receiving suggestions from people about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me the suggestions on what should be done in this summer season.
Although lice are in vogue, it is not new, but the remembrance of the lice at that time is very useful.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.

Several friends like Kartik have expressed concern for the birds.
These friends have said that water should be poured on the rooftop in the balcony. And I have seen that the young children of the family are doing this work very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, then they go to see 10 times a day, whether the vessels have water or not, and whether the birds have come or not
We know that this game is going on, but in reality it is a wonderful experience for a child to replicate his feelings.
Sometimes even a little experience with animals and birds gives you a new pleasure.
However, it is a matter of fact that we are coloured in the colours of animals and birds and nature in our country but it is essential that such efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Dawoodi Bohra used to be a hundred years old to be the religious leader of the society Syedna Saheb.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He had distributed about 52 thousand chickens to all corners of the world.
It was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that we come across our courtyards with paperwork, with milk, with vegetables, with postal stamps but we forget that there are days of summer.
Young friends, I would like to talk to you too.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation enjoys spending their lives in Aso-Aram.
Parents also raise them in a defensive situation.
I am confident that some friends will definitely make efforts and will tell me the truth.
Do you use this time of vacation as per my instructions I make three suggestions, if three of them are implemented then it is a very good thing but try to implement one of the three.
This is a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
Whether you have seen it or not, whether you have thought it or not, but if you feel like going there then you should try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in a book or listening to the acquaintances and feeling the same thing by oneself is a distinction between both.
I will urge you to do a new experiment to know whatever curiosity you have in this vacation.
Whether it is positive or a little out of comfort, do it.
We belong to a middle class family and a happy family.
I dont want to say that do it again and again.
Whether it is the time of the evening, whether it is your football or volleyball or any means of sports, you should reach the poorest of the poor.
Play yourself with those poor children, you will enjoy such a sport that you may have never met before.
And Im confident that if you go once then you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteers organisations continue to serve.
You are also associated with the Guru Gobind Singh ji, you should associate yourself with such an organization for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time, you would have felt that if you have done such a summer camp, you have studied the course of personality development then you should reach out to those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn those people without taking the money that you have learnt.
You can learn how to develop them.
Every person has become busy somewhere with technology.
Community is also a culture, collectivity is a power.
Today is the era of defeat.
Sometimes we feel afraid that our young generation is not becoming a human robot.
Efforts are being made to spend time with oneself away from technology.
You are learning some lyrics of music, you are learning 5-50 words of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
There is a country full of diversity and if we look at it, we can find someone in our surroundings.
You feel like learning car driving, do you ever want to learn auto rickshaws
You have driven a bicycle but you have tried to drive a three-wheeler cycle.
You will see that all these new experiments, these skills are such that will give you joy and the life that has been tied up in a maiden will take you out of it.
Do something out-of-box, my friend.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you would be wondering if all the examinations are completed and if you go to a new stage of career then it will not be possible to learn.
Later you will get into other troubles and that is why I would like to tell you that if you have the hobby of learning miracles then learn the miracles of the address.
Keep showing your warmth and affections.
I say from my experience that seeing the world brings so much learning and understanding that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like it and it is also true that whenever you are going, share your pictures.
What did you see new
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using the hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
Government of India has a scheme.
The BHIM App will be downloaded and you will also be using it.
But refer to others.
If a new person does three transactions and if he does economic business thrice then you earn 10 rupees for doing this thing.
10 rupees will be deposited in your account by the government.
If 20 people get it from them in a day, you will earn 200 rupees by evening.
Merchants can also earn, students can also earn.
And the scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute in making Digital India.
You will become a steward of a New India.
So vacation and earnings of income.
In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience says that the red light used to be on the vehicle, it used to be on the vehicle, but it used to drown in the mind and it was mentally VIP cultured home.
Now the red light has gone so that no one can claim that the red light in the brain has gone out.
I received a very interesting phone call.
Well, they have expressed their apprehensions in that phone, but now this phone call indicates that the common man does not like these things.
It feels like getting rid of it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shiva Chaube from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say something about the red beacon light ban of the government.
I read a line in Newspaper that I was very proud to hear that every Indian is a VIP on a road and I was glad that today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in traffic jams and I don't have to stop for anyone.
So I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that has been launched, our country is not only cleaning up and the VIP's guarantee is being cleared on our roads.
But we have to take it out with our hearts.
If we all make a concerted effort, we will be able to come out.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPIs in the country has increased rather than VIPs.
And when I am saying EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear - Every Person is Important.
Every individual has the importance of every individual.
If we accept the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians, if we acknowledge the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians then how powerful it will be to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always been saying that we should always remember our history, our cultures, our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of 125 crore countrymen Sant Ramanujacharya Ji.
We have been so small because of some reason that we have been thinking for centuries.
Century is of immense importance to other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years old memories in its fate.
What would have happened a thousand years ago
Very few people would be aware that Ramanujacharya ji had fought a very big fight against the evils in the society, the feeling of untouchability and the feeling of casteism.
Through his own conduct, society had swallowed up what was considered untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he had a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every age, a great man is born from our society to eliminate the evils of our society.
When we celebrate the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya Ji then take inspiration from him for social unity and organization to revive that feeling.
The Government of India is going to release a stamp to commemorate Sant Ramanujacharya on the day of May 19th.
I salute Sant Ramanujacharya Ji and pay my homage.
My dear countrymen, May 1st has a different significance.
It is also celebrated as a day of labour in many parts of the world.
Labour is being discussed and when it comes to Labourers then it is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the benefits that the workers receive today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Sant Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka, Jagat Guru Basaveshwar ji.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
This was an occasion for the public dedication of the collections of his promises.
In other words, Shram is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattapanth Thangdi Ji.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world celebrate the festival.
The problems that the world is facing today are violence, war, destruction, arms competition...
When we look at this environment then the ideas of Buddha appear very relevant.
And in India, Ashok's life is an excellent symbol of Buddha's journey from the war.
I am fortunate that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima, vesak day is celebrated by United Nations.
This year it is going to be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay my homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
They will get an opportunity to refresh their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 26 March 2019
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you, most of the families in the country will be busy in examining their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a slightly light environment and where the examinations are going on, those families will still have little concern.
But at this time, I would like to say this thing that during the last time I have listened to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
During the examination, that conversation will definitely work for you.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is Bangladeshs Independence Day.
A historic battle against injustice was the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh move ahead, develop and I assure the Bangladeshi people that India is a strong partner and a good friend and we will continue to contribute in peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our shared heritage.
Bangladesh's national anthem is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in the year 13, but also the British conferred Nighthood on him.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British. And we all know the incident of 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had the pleasure of serving Mother India on their faces - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were imbued with the sacrifices of Mother India's freedom.
And these three brave hearts are still the inspiration of all of us.
We cannot describe the legend of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three young men.
There were restrictions and hangings in the jails but the British were worried about how to move forward along with that.
And then we had to be hanged on 24th March but we were released on 23rd March.
The hangings were laid off from the burglary, which is not usually done.
And then the British quietly burnt their bodies in today's Punjab.
A few years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I used to feel a kind of wave on that land.
And I would certainly like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to visit Punjab, it is necessary to visit the places like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the zeal and intensity of freedom was increasing.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired many youngsters for the Armed Revolution. Mahatma Gandhi performed the Champaran Satyagraha on April 10, 11, just a hundred years ago.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, Gandhian philosophy and Gandhian ethos were reflected in India's freedom movement.
This was a major turning point in the entire freedom struggle.
In this era, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Satyagraha of Kheda, Satyagraha of Milajoor in Ahmedabad, and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and working style were visible.
In 1915, Gandhi came back from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1911 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a man who returned to India in 1915, a period of just two years.
Neither the country knew him nor his influence.
We can guess how much hard work and hard work they must have suffered at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was one such thing in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's impossible pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour showcases this wonderful philosophy by organizing, inspiring, bringing the poorest and the most destitute to fight against the British Sultanate.
And that is why we feel the immense pride of Mahatma Gandhi in this form.
However, if we think about Gandhiji a hundred years ago, it is a matter of great study for Gandhiji who had Champaran Satyagraha and for any person who started his public life then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study.
We can learn from them how to start a public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi had done it.
And this was the time when we heard the names of the greatest giant leaders, whether it was Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani Ji, all of them were sent to the villages.
He had learnt how to colour the work done by connecting people with the colors of freedom.
And the British did not understand what was the manner in which Gandhiji's methods and struggles were going on, creation was going on and both of them were going on together.
Gandhiji knew that he had built a coin on two sides.
Conflicts on one side of the coin and creation on the other.
On the one hand, Goddess Homi Devi filled the jail and on the other hand in constructive works.
There was a very strange balance in Gandhiji's work culture.
What is the word Satyagraha, what is the word of disagreement, what is wrong with such a massive Sultanate, what is the meaning of non-violence
This is the desire of the 1. 25 billion Indians to change and this is the effort of this transformation. This is the strength of New India and a New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party's election framework nor a project.
This is the feeling that 125 crore Indians together want to create a grand India.
125 crore Indians have a hope, a fervor, a resolution and a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we move a little away from our lives and try to understand what is happening around us, we will be surprised to know that the millions of people are selflessly looking at something for the society, for the exploited, the deprived, the deprived and the poor and the distressed besides their personal obligations.
And he keeps on doing penance like a custodian.
Many people visit the hospital everyday and help the patients.
Many people who come to know that they run for blood donation immediately.
There are many people who worry about their food if they are hungry.
Our country is Bahuratna Basundhara.
Public service is the service of God, this mantra is in our blood.
Once we want it in the form of collectivity and collectively, we will know how powerful this is.
When it comes to a New India, it is very natural to criticize and understand and look at it from a different perspective and it is a welcome to democracy.
But it is true that if one and a half crore Indians make a solemn pledge, if they make a solemn pledge, if they make a solemn pledge then the dream of New India - 1.
And it is not necessary that everything should be done by the budget, whether it is government projects or government funds.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will fulfil my responsibilities with full sincerity and dedication, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diesel in my life then what a big change can be brought about.
What I mean is that every citizen follows his civil religion and obeys his duty.
This can be a good beginning for a New India.
My dear countrymen, I also thank you today.
In the last few days, such an environment has been created in our country and a large number of people have participated in the Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
The curiosity of how transactions can take place without cash has also increased.
The poorest of the poor are also trying to learn and gradually the people are moving towards how to do business without cash.
After demonetization, there has been substantial increase in the different ways of digital payments.
With the launch of the BHIM App, it has been only 2-3 months but now about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption. Can 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge to work on digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
For 1. 25 billion Indians, if they want to do this thing then they dont have to wait for a year, they can do it in six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions. If we want to pay the bills then we will not pay the bills, we will have to travel in the railways, we will have to pay the digital payments if we buy the medicines then we will pay the digital payments and if we are running the shops of cheap grains then we will make the digital system.
We can do this in a day-to-day life.
You cannot imagine, but you can do a great service to the country and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes have been organized for the Digidhan Mela for public education.
It is a pledge to organize 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
It also included a prize scheme.
About 12. 5 lakh people have received this reward from the consumer.
0,000 people have received the reward for the traders.
Everyone has made a solemn pledge to carry forward this work.
And as decided several times earlier, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be concluded.
After a hundred days of completion, the last big event is going to take place.
A large number of draws have also been added to it.
I am confident that we should propagate the BHIM App in whatever time we have saved from the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Let us contribute to the reduction in cash transactions and how to reduce transactions with notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask the people for Mann Ki Baat, all kinds of suggestions come.
But I have seen that everyone has been insisting on cleanliness.
I would like to talk to you with my heart.
I want to say that people will have to understand how important cleanliness is.
Every day I pass by a river in which people throw lots of garbage and pollute the river.
That river comes to my house flowing from the bridge of Rispana.
Several people have also spoken about it but it has not benefitted from it.
And the good thing is that Gayatri herself is expressing her anger and is also instructing me. And at the same time she has also been telling me that she has made several attempts but she has failed.
Awareness has started from the journal.
Every person has been positively connected to it.
It has also taken the form of a movement.
Hate towards dirt is also increasing.
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, all of them have their own importance.
But cleanliness is associated with the habits of movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habit of Swachhata. It is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be done in a collective manner.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling has emerged in the new generation, in the children, in the students and in the youth of the country and this is a sign of good results.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, those who are listening to Gayatri, I would like to tell all those countrymen that this message of Gayatri should become a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat since then, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one thing since the beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about the waste of food.
We know that we take more food than required in the family and in the community food festivals.
Everything that is visible is taken in the pouch and it cannot be covered .
We cant afford half of the amount of potatoes that we fill and we cant afford it.
You have sometimes imagined how much damage we have done to the food we have left behind.
Have you ever thought that if we dont spoil our food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people.
Though efforts are being made by someone, sadness is a social treachery on this subject.
Injustice is done to the poor.
I am not appealing much on this subject but I want to raise awareness.
His life inspires us not to waste food.
We should eat as much as we need.
See, there are similar solutions for change.
And those people who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep your stomach empty, keep some plates empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally depressed.
The problem is that there are people around us but we are not able to recognize them and perhaps we are confined to speaking openly on this subject.
Those who are suffering from depression themselves do not even speak because they themselves feel embarrassed about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot be relieved.
There is a need to create a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, it needs to be transmitted.
Talk openly with your friends, friends, parents, brothers and sisters and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes one feels loneliness and especially the students staying in the hostels face a lot of difficulties.
The family grows up and remains mixed thereby causing unlikely depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that sometimes you have seen that any member of your parents or your daughter or family is sitting with everyone and he says that I will not go there anymore.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to live in a group and lives in a single corner then be careful that it should not happen.
This is the best solution.
And depression is the cause of mental and physical illness.
Just as diabetes is hosting every disease, depression also eliminates our capabilities for sustainability, fighting, venture and decision-making.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your atmosphere can stop you from depressing and if you have gone then you can quickly get out of it.
Help with your heart, share their happiness and grief, you will feel that the pain within you will end.
If you try to understand their sufferings and do them with service, you will have a new confidence.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly, your mindset will be lightened.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in getting rid of stress, getting rid of suppression and moving towards happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
All of you make preparations and celebrate Yoga festival in lakhs of groups.
If you have any suggestions on the 3rd International Yoga Day, send me through mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetic creations can be prepared about Yoga, it should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But women have special responsibilities along with work.
He also takes care of family responsibilities and collaborates in the economic responsibilities of his family, which often leads to injustice to his newborn children.
At that time, the Government of India has taken a very important decision to increase the maternity lease to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks at the time of their pregnancy.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then our children will grow up to make the country's precious price.
It will also ensure health of mothers and it will be an important decision for this.
This will benefit approximately 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the life of all these great men continue to inspire us and make us realize the resolve of a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shakul Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nine Samvatsar, I convey my best wishes to all of you for this new year.
This is a good time for the farmers to start harvesting after the spring season.
Nine years are celebrated in different ways in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Fruits on the branches of trees are seen shining in the sun.
Fruits of summer season are also seen in spring.
On the other hand, the yellow flowers of mustard in the field provide hope to the farmers.
The flower of saffron indicates the arrival of holi.
Amir Khusro has described the moments of climate change.
Amir Khusro has written: When the nature is happy, when the weather is beautiful, the people also enjoy this season.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi festivals illuminate the colours of happiness in human lives.
In an environment full of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to farewell to Fagan last month and we are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
Breastfeeding is a coincidence of two months.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to the millions of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I ignore my suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there is a barrier suggestion.
Bhubaneswar has written to me on the Narendra ModiApp that a lot of people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO. Therefore, he has said that I have given some information about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Prabhas ji thank you very much. You have sacrificed India's pride.
Be it poverty alleviation or be it prevention of diseases or be it connectivity with the world or be it knowledge or be it conveyance or be it technology or science, science has made its place everywhere.
15 February 2019 is a day of pride in Indias lives.
Our scientists have raised Indias glory to the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions over the years.
After the success of Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars, ISRO has created a world record in the field of space in the past.
And it is heartening to note that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but for the entire India.
ISROs Coast Infrastructure Efficient Space Programme has become a stupendous one for the entire world and the world sends me to appreciate the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is very important.
Cartosat-2D is Indias Satellite and through it, it will be of great help to the Urban Development Planning Pictures, Mapping of Resources, Infrastructure and Development.
Especially to my farmer brothers and sisters, how can we use the water resources in the country, how can we take care of it Our new satellite catrosat-2D will be very helpful in all these things.
As soon as our satellite was released, we also sent a few pictures.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that this entire mission has been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This enormous partnership between youth and women is a proud aspect of ISROs success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
The less we pay our entire team to these scientists.
Bhubaneswar has asked one more question and that is, India has achieved a major milestone in this regard in terms of India's security.
This thing has not been discussed in a very big way, but the focus of Prabhakar Ji has been on this important thing.
India has also successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in the field of Defence.
This interception technology-driven missile was successfully destructed by destruction of enemy missiles at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground during its testing.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that even if India comes to an attack from a distance of 200 kilometres, then this missile will destroy it in space.
Whenever we want new technologies, we get a new scientific achievement.
And the curiosity has played a very big role in the development journey of human life.
And those who possess the unique intellectual genius do not allow curiosity to remain in the form of curiosity. It also raises questions within them, discovers new curiosity and creates new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for innovation.
Until they get the answer, they sit on their feet.
And if we observe the journey of human life for thousands of years then we can say that this journey of development of human life is not complete.
Full break is impossible.
Efforts are continuously being made to understand Brahman, the rules of creation and the mindset of mankind.
New science and new technologies emerge from it.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, I have often talked about the fact that our younger generation should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific temperament becomes a cause for a stable change in the lives of future generations.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Invitations were made for social innovation.
How to identify, showcase such discoveries, give information to the people and how such discoveries can work for the common man, how to use them for the commercial use of heavy manufacturing.
Many times the problem also reflects the importance of science in solving.
In Mumbai, it was raining in 2005, it was flooded, it was also flooded in the sea and there was a lot of difficulty and crisis. And whenever there was a natural calamity then the first crisis came to the poor.
The two brothers worked very consciously towards this thing and they developed a house that protects the deprived ones, protects the deprived ones, protects them from water logging and also protects them from water logging diseases.
And our society also becomes technology-driven.
Mechanisms are also made technology-based.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, a lot of importance has been placed on digital payments.
Gradually, people have come out of the hurdles and moved towards the Digital movement.
In India too, digital payments are increasing at a rapid pace.
In particular, the youngsters have been habituating digital payments with their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to him.
In our country, the Lucky Consumer Scheme Digidhan Business Scheme has received tremendous support in the past.
It has been almost two months and 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is heartening to note that under the DigiDhan Yojana so far, 10 lakh people have been rewarded, more than 50 thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
Under this scheme, most of the consumers are those who have received a prize of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of fifty thousand rupees.
Whether it is a farmer, a trader, a small entrepreneur, a businessman, a housewife, a student, everyone is enthusiastic about this scheme.
From Mysore, Shriman Santosh ji happily wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Customer Scheme.
But I should tell you that they have written the biggest thing.
He said, I received a reward of Rs. 1,000 and at that time I came to know that a poor old woman had a fire in her house.
When the goods were burnt to death, I felt that perhaps the poorest of the elderly mothers had the right to receive the prize, I gave them thousands of rupees.
You did a very inspiring job.
All these things keep on giving us the knowledge of this digital.
He keeps talking with such enthusiasm and encourages others.
I will urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country and the Lucky Grahak Yojana or the reward given to them by the Digital Business Scheme that you yourself have become its ambassador.
You take it forward and that work is in a way anti-corruption activists.
In a way you are a soldier of ethics.
You are aware that on the completion of 100 days of the Lucky Consumer Scheme, Dr.
This is a memorable day.
On 14th April, there will be a pricing draw of Rs.
There are still about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing after remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Recently, Babasaheb Ambedkar was born on his 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering them, at least 125 people should learn to download the BHIM App.
Learn how this leads to transactions and especially to the small traders around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and BHIM App, I would like to say this thing, Dr.
This movement has been going on for the past two-three months. Several townships, several villages and cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to our country's economy.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic growth of the country.
I would like to tell you that today I am very happy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard and filled the stores of food.
With the hard work of the farmers in our country, record food has been produced this year.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there has been a wave of crops in the fields that it seemed as if pongal and basakhi are valid today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I want to thank the farmers for their traditional crops and also for their cultivation of different pulses keeping in mind the poor of the country because pulses produce the highest protein for the poor.
I am glad that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and cultivated pulses on nearly two lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service done by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way the farmers of my country have worked hard and produced records on their behalf by making an appeal to me.
My dear countrymen, this is something that has been going on in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institutions and by the organizations in our country.
In a way, everyone is being seen to be aware of cleanliness in some way.
And in the state of Telangana, there was not only a seminar in the dam rooms in Warangal, but also what was the importance of direct sanitation.
On February 19-18, a toilet pit exercise was organised in Hyderabad.
The toilet pits of six houses were cleaned by evacuating them and the officials themselves showed that the empty empty pits without pit toilet can be brought back to use.
He also demonstrated how convenient the new technology toilets are and there is no inconvenience in cleaning it, there is no constraint, there is no psychological barrier.
And we can clean a toilet in the same way as we can simply clean it.
And the result of this effort was that when an IAS officer cleanses the toilet then it is natural for the country to pay attention to it.
And from the toilet pit that we consider waste, but from the point of view of fertilizer, it is equivalent to black gold.
We can see what is happening from the waste to wealth.
And this has been proved.
A standard "Twin Pit Toilet" model for the family of six members gets filled in about five years.
Thereafter, the waste can be easily removed and redirected to another pit.
The waste collected in pits in six to twelve months is completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handling and are very important from the point of view of fertilizer NPK.
Farmers are very well familiar with NPK.
And now a special programme is being organized in Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as it can.
The government also considers various departments as Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the first fortnight of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs Tribal Affairs Ministry will give a boost to this cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan in the last two weeks in March.
We know that whenever a poor citizen of our country does something good, the entire country feels a new energy and a lot of confidence.
We all welcomed the exhibition performed by our Divyang players at the Rio Paralympics.
In the finals of the Blind T-20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan and enhanced the country's pride for the second consecutive World Championship.
It is a matter of pride for our Divyang friends of the country.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every time we learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
He is moving ahead with a lot of hard work and illuminating the country with his achievements.
In the last few days, our women sportspersons won the Silver Medal in Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March marks the World Womens Day.
Giving importance to the girl child in India as well as enhancing their awareness and sensitivity in the family and society.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme but it has become a campaign of social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, the programme has connected the common man.
In every corner of the country, these vigorous issues have forced people to think and have brought about a change in the thinking of the people towards the old ways of life that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a child, it was a matter of great pleasure.
In a way, positive thinking towards girl child is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that under a special drive in the Cuddalore district of the state of Tamil Nadu, children have been banned.
More than 15 children have been prevented so far.
The District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand girls under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
All the departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme under the Convergence Model in the Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir. Besides organizing Gram Sabhas, efforts are being made to ensure that the orphan girls are taken care of by the district administration.
Under the Har Ghar Dastak programme in Madhya Pradesh, a drive is being carried out to educate the girl child from village to village.
The children who had been drop-out have been re-schooled and re-schooled by running the 'BachaUpnaVidyalaya' campaign in Rajasthan.
What I mean is that Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has taken several forms of this movement.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New ideas are associated with it.
It has been paralysed as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign when we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
My dear countrymen, you get the opportunity to talk about something at various times in Mann Ki Baat. Women is the power, empowerment, it is the woman of India.
I know a lot from you.
What is happening on the earth, what is happening in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the past, we have celebrated several festivals.
Yesterday, the Birth Anniversary of Krishna was celebrated across India.
And a person can find solutions to the present problems from the life of Shravan.
Sometimes it is a feeling of innovation in everything.
And that is why today when I am talking to you, I look forward to two moments.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakraborty used his intellect, his duties, his capabilities and his thoughts to fight the war.
And the Charkha Dhari Mohan opted for such a way that for the sake of freedom, for the preservation of human values, for strengthening the roots of individuality, he gave such a turning point to the freedom movement which is surprising for the entire world.
Be it the importance of selfless service or be it the importance of knowledge or be it the importance of laughing and marching ahead in all walks of life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna.
Today, while we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for a bigger festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Who gave a new dimension to human history and set new dimensions.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Anyone, whenever needed, was always present for the service of Mahatma Gandhi.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized on the spirituality associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, society, humanity and humanity were all the same.
Whether it is a Phoenix Farm in Africa or a Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, in a unique way, he stressed on social upliftment and community mobility.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit and bow down to several important places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that with Gandhi Seva Bhav, the emphasis was on organizationalism.
Social service and social upliftment, community service and community mobilisation are the feelings that we can bring down in our lives as well.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No, my countrymen.
And collectivity has its own strength.
All these programmes of the Gandhi Symposium should have collectivity and service.
Why don't we get out of here
If we are a football team, we will not only play football teams but will also work in accordance with Gandhian ideals.
We can do a lot, we can collect old books and share them among the poor and spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore enterprises.
Business, goodwill, goodwill and dedicated service is done for the feeling of joy and happiness freely.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha and Dandi are important turning points in the freedom struggle.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
I urge you to visit one of the places associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be any place.
Be it Porbandar or Sabarmati Ashram or Vardhan Ashram or be it connected with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And write two or four words expressing your emotions.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I would like to share with you.
Venice Biennel is a well-known art programme where artists from all over the world gather.
This time, a very interesting exhibition related to Gandhiji's memories has been organized in the India Pavilion of Venice Biennial.
The pictures of Haripura were particularly interesting in it.
You might remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected as the Chairperson, was also involved in the history.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and exhibition of his art work.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artworks enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his art instruments have made the Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages surrounding Haripura and then produced some artworks depicting the life of rural India.
Venice of precious artefacts was discussed a lot.
Once again on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to making a solemn pledge from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for the sake of a world.
You must be reminded that in the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva movement within the country for nearly two weeks before the 2nd October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will go out of our homes and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
Whether it is home or street, chowk or drain, school or college, we will run a mass movement of cleanliness at all public places.
This time, we have given special emphasis on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eliminate single use plastic.
This time, on the second October, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate him to a free India from open defecation but will also lay the foundation for a new folk movement against plastic in the entire country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to the people of every village and small towns, to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a liberation from plastic waste.
2nd October as a special day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, let us celebrate a special Shramdaan.
All the municipalities, municipalities, district-rural system, rural panchayats, government-ruled systems, all the organizations, all the organizations, all the citizens, all of them are urging everyone to make proper arrangements for collection and storage of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, they should come forward and settle down for proper disposal.
It can be recycled.
This can make fuel.
This way we can also complete the safe disposal of plastic waste by this Diwali.
Just need a resolution.
There is no need to look at inspiration.
Who else can be a bigger inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is a well-defined gem of knowledge.
We can get what we want in life.
Recently, my connectivity with them has come down.
But earlier my connectivity was much higher.
Today, I want to touch a very important point with a Sanskrit definition.
And that is the thing written centuries ago but what is the importance of this thing even today
One of the best definitions is: Prithviyaya Trini Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhashitam, Moodhya: Pashankhandshan Ratna Sanjna Pradityette, water, food and well-defined jewels on earth.
Rocks are called Ratnas.
There is a lot of food in our culture.
Even then, we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
Balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and young children, because they are the cornerstone of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malpractices in a new and fascinating manner.
Once upon a time, one thing was brought about in my mind.
In Nasik, Mudhtibar Dhana has become a big movement.
The Anganwadi workforce collects grains during the crop yield.
This cereal is used to cook fresh food for children and women.
In a way, a donor becomes a citizen and a social worker.
After that, he himself is dedicated to this goal and he becomes a soldier of the movement.
We all have heard about the food-processing culture in every corner of India.
This is the first time that a child starts feeding solid food.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted by anyone.
In many states, people are running Tithi Food Campaign.
The family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious meals and tasty meals and go to Anganwadi and the family members themselves serve, feed and share happiness and also increase happiness.
There is a wonderful blend of service and joy.
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
Nutrition Mission will be celebrated across the country in the month of September.
I had never thought that I would become a place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world.
I had never imagined how diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to.
I had never imagined that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch the youth of the world.
I had visited Bhutan last week.
I have seen that as Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to visit anywhere. And due to International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if I meet and sit in the world, someone in the world is questioning me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has organised this programme in 165 countries.
Today, when there is a thread of a global movement on environment, global warming and climate change, I hope that this programme will greatly help the Discovery Channel in introducing the world about the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in India's Sanskrit Yatra.
And in our country, people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment.
However, one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me sympatheticly, Modi Ji tells me that if you speak Hindi and you don't know Bear Grills Hindi then how did you have a conversation with you so fast
Or later, it has been edited.
They ask with a lot of curiosity.
Oh, yes, there is nothing wrong with this.
Many people have this question in their minds and I can declare that mystery.
If you look at it, it's not a mystery.
In fact, technology has been widely used in interaction with Bear Grills.
It was simultaneously translated into English and Bear Grylls had a small cordless device in his ear.
Though I used to say Hindi, but it used to happen in English, and because of that the dialogue becomes easier, and this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures.
I have said this thing before and I have stressed upon you that you must visit Ishaan Bharat in your life.
The world inside you will expand.
On 15th August, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
Go to 15 such places with the aim of 100 tourism, see, study, take the family and spend some time there.
A country full of diversity will fill you with diversity as a teacher.
Your life will be expanded.
Your thinking will be widespread.
And trust me that there are places within India from where you will come with new energy, new zeal, new zeal and new zeal.
Your family will also feel like this.
My dear countrymen, the environmental concerns and concerns in India are natural.
Last month, I was fortunate to announce the tiger population in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
A resolution was taken expressing concern over the declining population of tigers in the world.
This was the resolve to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India that we are achieving our goals at the earliest.
We doubled the population of tigers in 2017.
In India, not only tiger population but also the number of reserved areas and community reserved areas has increased.
When I was announcing the tiger population, I also remembered the lions of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took charge of the Chief Minister there, the area of residence of lions was shrinking in the jungle of Gir.
Their numbers were decreasing.
We took one step after another in the Gir.
In 2009, it was decided to upgrade the women's guards there.
Infrastructure reforms have been made to boost tourism.
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife, we talk of conservation only.
But now we have to move ahead with our defence and think about compassion and compassion.
Our scriptures have received very good guidance in this regard.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Swami Vivekanand Ji on September 11, 1983
These young monks of India, who cheated the mankind from all over the world, had left India's brilliant identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekananda ji saw India, Swami Vivekananda ji knew the strength of India, let us try to live up to it.
We have everything inside us, we have to come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that 2nd August is celebrated as the National Sports Day.
On this occasion, we are going to launch Fit India Movement Clean India Campaign across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you in POSHAN Abhiyaan in 2nd August, FIT India, in the month of September, and especially during 11th September to 2nd October, the Swachhta Abhiyan and on 2nd October, the entirely dedicated space mission.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, this is the same thing in Mann Ki Baat today.
I'll meet you again.
I will look forward to your suggestions and your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters, to realise the dreams of Gandhi: Swatantra Sukhaya, to fulfil the dreams of our freedom fighters.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at all levels, every time, the importance that is given to the rights, the same important duties should be given to them.
Indias democracy can move forward at a rapid pace only on two pages of rights and duties.
Yesterday is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country, keeping a silence of 2 minutes by 11.
As a society, as a nation, on 30th January, at 11 o'clock, it should be a comfortable feeling for two minutes.
2 minutes, but it should also be a tribute to collectivity, determination and martyrdom.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various valour prizes.
The awards include several categories like Kirti Cycle, Shaurya Cycle, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially urge the youngsters, you are very active in social media.
Can you do one thing The brave men who have received this honour - look for it on the network, write two good words related to it and spread it among your colleagues.
We are also surprised, proud and inspired when we are aware of their courage, valour and valour.
On the one hand, when we were delighted with the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of 26 January, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who were engaged in the service of the nation were brave due to avalanches.
I pay my homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware of the fact that I have been continuously talking about Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are months of Kasauti for every family.
There are one or two children in the house but the entire family is buried under the burden of exams.
So I was convinced that this is the right time that I should talk to the student friends, I should talk to their parents, I should talk to their teachers because wherever I went for so many years, the examination was witnessed by a very big problem.
A strange psychological environment is seen in every household in terms of family distress, student suffering, teacher suffering.
And I always feel like going out of it and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in some detail.
When I announced this topic, several teachers, parents and students sent a message to me, they also expressed their pain and expressed their thoughts and thoughts on the issues that I wanted to talk to you today.
I received a telephone message from the creation.
So I want to ask you this much that this atmosphere cannot be pleasant
The question has been asked by the universe but this question will be in your minds.
Exams should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
It should be a festival of joy and enthusiasm that has worked hard throughout the year, which has now come to show.
There are very few people for whom exams are happy, while exams are a pressure for most people.
It is to be decided that you will be happy that you will feel pressure.
The one who enjoys happiness will get it and the pressure that he enjoys will prevail.
And that is why I believe that examination is a festival, take the exam in such a way that when there is a festival and when there is a festival, the best in us comes out.
The power of the society is also felt on the occasion of the festival.
Normally we feel that how discreet we are, but if we look at the arrangements for the Kumbh Congregation that lasted for 40-45 days, we will realise what is the discipline of Make Shift Arrangement among the people.
This is the strength of the festival.
During the examination, there should be a festival in the entire family, friends and neighbours.
You will see that this pressure will be transformed into happiness.
Festival environment will be resilient.
And I would like to urge the parents to make this festival a festival for three-four months.
It is the duty of all of us to change these three-four months every year into festivals by understanding our traditions and by understanding the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see that you have relaxed yourself, you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed, you will easily remember the old things of yours.
A year ago, what a teacher had said in classrooms would recall the entire scene.
And you should know that the power to recall memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door is closed, it does not go inside and it does not come out.
The thought process stops, which becomes a booze in itself.
You must have seen in the examination that you remember everything, the chopper is remembered, the topic is remembered, the page chromosome is remembered, it is written upwards, it is also remembered downwards.
Why didn't you remember inside, there was pressure
But the insider immediately came out and the outsider meant that you were relaxed.
And that is why it is relaxation if any medicine is the biggest memorial to recall memorial.
And I say this thing on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there is a relax then we never imagine it.
And it is not that you don't have knowledge, it is not that you don't have information, it is not that you didn't work.
However, whenever there is a tension, your knowledge, your information gets suppressed and your tension becomes dominated by it.
And that is why it is important that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exam in the right perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life-style.
The exams that you are going to give are the tests that you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the case of your life.
There is no test of how you have lived your life, how you are living your life and how you want to lead your life.
In your life, apart from the examinations given in the classroom, you must have got the opportunity to pass through a lot of difficulties.
And that is why the success of life should be liberated from the burden of testing.
In front of us all, our former President Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great inspiration.
Anandji has sent a question to me: Today, if I can see the biggest challenge before education, it has become the focus of education.
uality has become the most important.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress among the students.
I want to know your thoughts about this present direction of education and its future.
Though he himself has given his answers, but debtor wants me to present my statement here.
Marks and marksheets are very limited use.
There is nothing like that in life.
Life continues on how much knowledge you have gained.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, lives are being done on it.
The sense of mission that you have received, your sense of familiarity, your mission and ambition are gaining momentum or are leading a life.
If you rely on such matters then the marks will be behind you and you will not have to run behind the marks.
You will have knowledge, skills, self-confidence and will power.
You tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family member will visit him who is a family doctor.
No one of you would have asked his family doctor about the qualities he had passed on.
No one would have asked.
Just imagine, brother, as a doctor, you are benefiting from it and you started taking care of them.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why the emphasis on these qualities sometimes stops us from moving in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I have said that it is not just a thing to read.
Its use is essential for our distress.
I was there yesterday and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes it happens and if you look at yourself from close quarters then you will realise that if you are lagging behind in the qualities then you will find a short way, you will find a few selected things and you will focus on it.
However, if you focus on quality then slowly you are confined to yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get a mark.
It may be that despite being an intelligent person in the examination, he sometimes fails in his life.
One thing that Richa ji has said is competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Indeed, competition does not come in the way to advance life, it comes in the way of advancing life, it means competitiveness with oneself when I am competitive.
How to do better tomorrow
One of the characteristics of the life of most successful players is that they compete with each other.
Let us take the example of Sachin Tendulkar ji.
When you are going to examine friends in every sphere of life then imagine, if you can read peacefully for two hours then can you study for three hours
S.
Sundar ji has expressed his feelings on the role of girls.
They say that the role of girls in the examination is very important.
He further wrote: My mother was not married, but she used to sit with me and tell me to be counted as a mathematician.
Because mothers are conscious of the future of the households, they are active, they make things very simple.
Once you have learnt to accept, most of the problems will be solved there itself.
Every corpse must have experienced this thing.
Friends, teachers are at the root of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
Expectations make it difficult to wait.
By accepting the situation, we get an opportunity to open a new path.
And therefore accept what is there.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask a single question about his health.
What is the situation there and what is the situation, what is the disease and what is the situation
The boys started to wear and within the first two-four minutes they made the environment lighter.
We are often afraid of illness by visiting a sick person.
I would like to tell the girls that sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever felt that during the days of exams you should give laughter to the children .
You see, the environment will change.
I have received a wonderful phone call.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot mention my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to pass by imitation then I got caught in it too. And because of this I had a lot of trouble with my friends around me.
You must have heard this several times, don't scream, don't steal.
I once again tell you the same thing.
Once there is a habit of stealing, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
You might not be required to imitate their entire creativity if you prepare for the examination.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that is being faced during our examination and my second question is, or why does the exam feel light, why not thank you
If there is an inclusive development then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Someone says that I should first pass all these exams and then play.
So it is impossible.
The rest of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever imagined that when all this is happening in front of you, you should come out for two moments and look at the sky, look at the trees and plants, take a little bit of your mind.
By doing so, you will see that once again you will come back to your room and in your books.
Whatever you are doing, keep it for a while, stand out, go out in the kitchen, look for the things you like, and if you get a future biscuit then eat.
Why not just for five minutes, but take some breaks.
There is no need to remain closed in any room for deep breathing .
Go to the bottom of the open sky, go to the bottom of the sky, breathe deeply for five minutes and then sit to study again.
You will feel that the body will be very light and body will not only become light but it will also make the brain lighter .
Some people feel that I will wake up late in the night - I will read more and more.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs.
It will be fresh.
Your efficiency will grow dramatically.
Whenever I hold meetings at the time of election, sometimes I sweat myself.
I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep
He gave me a herb.
In fact, if we understand the importance of these things then we will be benefitted.
But this does not mean that just lying down .
Otherwise, the people of your family will disagree with me.
And the day your marksheet arrives, you will not be able to see them.
The person who plays, shines is a major medicine for keeping the mind, intelligence and body cautious.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not let the burden of what I have said.
I also feel that the way I advise your parents not to become a bogey.
Keeping faith in yourself by remembering your resolve, go for examination.
My best wishes.
Make festivals and festivals to cross every difficulty.
Then there will never be any irritation.
Take this mantra forward.
Dear Countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years in February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and soldiers of the Coast Garden for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has retained its position among the four largest Coast Guards in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, the Coast Garden people had undertaken a massive campaign to clean the coastal areas of our country along with their responsibilities and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people would be aware of the fact that not only men are present in the Coast Guard in our country but women are also equally responsible for their obligations.
Coast Gardens are not only our women officers as pilots, observers, but also undertake honorcrafts.
Today, when an important topic of maritime security is being created around the world, I congratulate the Indian Coast Guard for its 40th anniversary of its maritime security.
1st February is the festival of Basant Panchami.
Bastar has been accepted as the best season.
She is the queen of spring seasons.
Opportunity for the worship of a Vidyarthi is considered.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the braves.
My colour de Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani also fills new forms with its own imagination.
Immediately after completing my thoughts from last month, he has started talking about mindset in regional languages.
It has received widespread approval.
People are writing letters from far and wide.
I congratulate Akashwani for this self-inspirational work.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar and I convey my best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is an occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Jesus said that the poor are not our beneficiaries, we want to accept that Lord Christ has not only served the poor but has also preached the service done by the poor and that is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
It is said in the story that Lord Jesus stood by the threshold of a temple.
Many immortals came there and they donated immensely.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and she donated two coins of copper as a donation.
In such a scenario, two coins of copper are not very big donors.
It was very natural for the devotees present there to feel irritated.
Lord Jesus said that this woman has donated the most because all others have donated a lot in donations but this woman has dedicated herself to the supreme sacrifice.
Today, 25th December is also the birth anniversary of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviya ji gave a new dimension to modern education, bringing about a spirit of determination and self-confidence among the Indian people.
Just two days back, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in the Tapobhumi of Malviya Ji in Banaras.
I have laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre will be a boon not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the country by achieving success in the nuclear energy sector.
Whether it is the leader of the party or the member of the parliament or the minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji established an idealism in every role.
On the occasion of Atal ji's birth anniversary, I salute him and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
A lot of memories swim with him in front of his eyes.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In other words, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is village or city, whether it is educated or uneducated, whether it is a cashless business, how it can be purchased without cash, the climate of curiosity is spread all over the country.
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to give a boost to this thing, to make mobile banking more robust, two new incentive schemes for customers and small traders are going to start from today.
One scheme to promote customers - Lucky Consumer Plan and other Scheme for Promotion of Merchants - Digital Trade Scheme
Today, on 25th December, as a gift of Creamsum, fifteen thousand people will get prizes from the drone system and those 15 thousand people will receive a prize of Rs.
Fifteen thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
In 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees but this prize will be deserved only when you use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD and this will be the basis of which you will be drawing.
With this, there will be a major one day a week for such customers, including prize money of lakhs and three months later, on 14th April, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a bumbler drone with a prize of crores.
DigiDhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen themselves connect with this scheme and also connect consumers to make their own business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and these rewards will be in thousands.
The traders will also carry out their own businesses and will also get the boost of rewards.
This scheme has been formulated by keeping every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class at the centre. And that is why those people will get the benefit of this scheme if they purchase something above 50 rupees and purchase less than three thousand rupees.
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this prize.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through featured phones and normal phones using USSD and sell goods and also pay the money and every person can be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
People in rural areas can also buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win prizes.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youngsters around you will be familiar with it and you will be able to ask them.
Friends, Your family will also have children studying in class 10-12. Those people will also be able to easily learn this.
Its very simple - the way you send a vote-up message from a mobile phone, this is the easiest thing.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that the awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to do e-payment and how to make online payments is increasing at a rapid pace.
In the last few days, cashless trade and cashless trade has increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
Many traders can apply this decision very well.
Traders who do digital transactions, who will replace their business with online payment system, have been exempted from incomplete.
Everyone has carried forward this mission in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu has appointed a committee to consider several schemes in this regard.
However, I have noticed that several state governments have started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Government of Assam has decided to grant 10 discount on digital payments of Property Tax and Trade License fees.
The rural banks whose branches will provide at least two digital transactions of at least 5 of their customers in the period January-March will receive a prize of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
As on 31st March, 2019, the Government has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh under Uttam Panchayat for Digi Transactions to 100 Digital Transaction villages.
Under the Digital Farmer Shiromani for the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5000 to 10 farmers, which will be available to those who are fully digitally utilised for procurement of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to every government that has initiated such a good start.
Several institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital procurement among the village poor farmers.
I have come to know that GNFC - Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Chemicals Limited, which works as a major fertilizer, has installed 1,000 POS machines to facilitate the farmers and 35 thousand farmers have been given 5 lakh fertilizers through digital mode and this work has been done in the last two weeks.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, the informal sector is very big. And most of the people are required to pay the wages of the wages, the wages of the wages or the wages of the wages.
Wherever they should get 100 rupees, they should get 80 rupees, they get 50 rupees and they are deprived of other facilities in the health sector like insurance.
But now cashless payments are going on.
The money is being deposited directly into the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the abduction is being stopped and the cut-offs are also being stopped. And it has become possible for the workers, the workers and the ordinary people to get the full compensation.
Besides, they are also becoming entitled to other benefits.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
Technology is easily accessible to us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made great strides with startups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital payments.
Our youth should not only strengthen this sector with new ideas, new technologies, new methods, but also connect the country with the campaign to get rid of black money and corruption.
Most of the writers have pointed to the fact that such a good work, the work of beauty of the country, such a sacred work, however, however, people have made a mention of the ways and means of finding new ways for the wrongdoings.
And the third stage is that in which people have supported what is happening, but at the same time, this fight should be carried forward, corruption and black money should be eradicated and more stringent steps should be taken for this thing.
I am grateful to the countrymen that it has helped me by writing all these letters.
ShrimanGurumaniKey has written on MayGov: "This step in curbing the current fiscal is commendable.
We are being troubled by the citizens, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are cooperating in this war.
We are fighting like armed forces against corruption, black money etc. The same spirit that Garumani Kelly ji has written has emerged in every corner of the country.
We are all feeling it.
But it is also true that when people suffer from problems and difficulties then who is such a person who does not have pain .
I feel the same pain as you have.
But, for a noble cause, when it comes to achieving a higher objective, when it comes to a good deed, the countrymen remain united in the midst of these difficulties, in the midst of grief and pain.
In fact, these people are the first to transform.
I also thank the people for another reason that they have not only faced difficulties, but have also given a cordial answer to some people who are trying to mislead people.
Someone has spread rumors, the spelling written on the note is wrong, someone has said that the price of salt has increased, some rumors are spreading, 2000 notes are about to be postponed, 500 and 1000 notes are also going to be postponed, this is also going to be postponed again.
I salute this power of the people for hundreds of years.
My dear countrymen, I can clearly feel that nothing is impossible when a billion Indians stand with you.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country, I salute them that people have participated in this magic against corruption and black money.
There will be widespread discussions in the Parliament for political parties as well as for political parties.
If the Parliament had gone, it would have been a good discussion.
The people who are spreading the rumors that political parties have all the concessions is wrong.
Those people who cannot support open corruption and black money have been searching for government errors all the time.
This government is for public participation.
The government is constantly trying to react to the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the very first day that the fighting was extraordinary.
How powerful are the possibilities that have been associated with the black business of Beema and corruption for 70 years
Whenever I have decided to compete with such people, they also adopt new methods to defeat the government.
I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to our fellow countrymen.
How did this become possible
I have said this mystery.
The mystery is that I am getting all this information from the people.
A lot of more information is received from the citizens of Adna and most of us are getting success because of the awareness of ordinary citizens.
Can any citizen of my country imagine the dangers that he is facing to open such elements
And most of the information that is being received is getting success.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can also send it on the basis of your request to grant such a validity.
You can also send it on May Gov.
There is also a third group of journalists, which is also in large numbers.
He says: Modi ji will not get tired, will not stop and he will be able to take as many steps as he has to take, but now once he has taken the road, he will have to reach Manjil.
I especially thank all those who write such letters because there is a faith in their letters and blessings.
And there is no question of returning to the work for which 1. 25 billion Indians are blessed.
We have brought it out and we have enacted a very stringent Benami Property Act.
These laws will also work in the coming days.
For the benefit of the nation, whatever is required for the welfare of the people is our priority.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month too, I had said that even in the midst of these difficulties, our farmers have broken the records of last year in their crops by working hard.
This is a good indicator of the agriculture sector.
Be it the labourer of this country or the farmer of this country or the youth of this country, the hard work of all these people is bringing a new color today.
In the past, on the global economic stage, India has made its name very glorious in many fields.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In the Global Innovation Index-2016, we have improved 16 places and the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index improved by 1 in 2016.
There are several reports in which evaluation of this direction has been directed and India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The President, the Vice President also conveyed his open disapproval.
However, in such a scenario, sometimes something good happens and then one gets a lot of satisfaction.
A good work has been done in the midst of Hobala of the Parliament, which the country has not noticed.
Brothers and sisters, Today I feel very proud and glad to say this thing that my government has passed a bill related to Divyangjans.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to the crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to the Divyangjans.
I have personally tried to make it more sustainable.
I wanted the Divyangjans to get their rights and honour, which they deserve.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and trust when they won four medals in the Paralympics.
He not only enhanced the dignity of the country but also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, have a precious heritage and a priceless heritage.
I am happy today that after the passage of this Act in the interest of Divyangjans, there will be more opportunities for Divyangjans.
For them, the limit for reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides for special provisions for redressal of education, facilities and grievances of persons with disabilities.
You can guess how sensitive the government is for the Divyangjans that in the last two years, the central government has organized 4,350 camps for the Divyangjans and has distributed resources to 5,80,000 Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
The government has passed a new law in accordance with the feelings of nation building.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have come to know from the field of sports that has made us proud.
Being an Indian, it is very natural for all of us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four-fold in the series of opposite to England.
The work of some young sportspersons has been commendable.
The vast Kohli of the test dried up and led a good leadership along with good betting.
Indian Cricket Team off-spinner R.
Ashwin has been declared the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016 by the ICC.
My best wishes to all of you.
Even in the field of hockey, good news came after fifteen years and gave good news.
Our Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, this opportunity came when the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Congratulations to the youngsters for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian hockey team.
Last month, our women sportspersons too did wonders.
Indias women's Hockey team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days back, India's women's hockey team won a bronze in the Asia Cup for players under the age of 18.
I heartily congratulate all the cricketers and hockey teams.
Last month we were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, once again I had crossed the border with China to celebrate Diwali with the jawans.
I celebrated Diwali at the height of the Himalayas with the jawans and soldiers of ITBP.
He was full of emotions and not only this, the message of good wishes sent by the countrymen, it was a wonderful reflection of the country's security forces in their happiness.
And people did not just send messages but they were connected with their hearts.
Someone made a video that means almost every household had become a guardian of soldiers.
And whenever I looked at those letters, I was also surprised to see how much imagination, how many emotions were filled and from that Mygov thought that a few selected things should be made a coffee table book.
Work is underway.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of all of you about the feelings of the soldiers of the country - your feelings towards the security forces of the country will be integrated into this epic.
But the truth is, this time it was not so.
This time it did not seem that there are festivals and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are also celebrating Diwali with crores of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the armed forces, the military strength increases by 125 crores.
Some time ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanches of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with such love, with such openness, these Sarpanches of the villages spoke and touched my heart.
I urged them to go and concentrate on the future of those children.
Today, I am glad that all the Sarpanches from the Kashmir valley have fulfilled the promises made to me and made everyone aware by visiting the villages.
Just a few days ago, when the Board was examined, about 95 percent of the students and students from Kashmir and the boys and girls from Kashmir participated in the Board examination.
The participation of such a large number of students in the board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education, for a bright future.
I congratulate him for his enthusiasm but I congratulate his parents, his volunteers, his teachers and all the village sarpanches.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked people for a suggestion for Mann Ki Baat then I can say that all the suggestions have come in one direction.
Everyone used to say that 500 and 1,000 notes should be discussed in detail.
However, on the 8th of November, I had talked about launching a massive campaign to improve the country while addressing the nation in the name of the nation.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is, the more important it is.
And I was convinced that we will have to face many new challenges in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
The diseases that we have been suffering from forty-six years cannot be simple.
I can understand your problems and your telephone well.
However, when I see your support, I see your cooperation and several attempts are being made to mislead you, even then sometimes the incidents that disturb your minds are coming out, you have understood this path of truth and you have accepted this thing in the country's interest to stop the notes of 500 and thousands.
And such a large country, such a large number of notes, such a large number of notes, such notes and these decisions are being scrutinized by the world. Every economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The whole world is seeing this thing that whether the millions and millions of Indians will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges.
There may be questions in the minds of the world.
India has only a reverence for the 1. 25 billion Indians and it is a belief that crores of Indians will fulfil their resolutions.
And our country will emerge as a country of gold in every way and it will emerge as a result of this thing.
This path of success has also been possible due to you.
All the units of central government, state governments, local bodies, lakhs of bank employees in 1 lakh thirty thousand bank branches, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of various kinds of tensions, all these people consider it a yagna of service to the nation with utmost calmness and work as an attempt to bring about a great change.
When it starts in the morning, it doesn't even know when it will be night, but everyone is doing it.
And that is why it is clear that India will succeed in this thing.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank and the post office are working in such a difficult situation.
And if we talk about humanity then we can see two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old brother had accidentally occurred in Khandav.
Suddenly there was a need for funds.
It was a matter of great pleasure for the local bank employees to know that they themselves provided money to their homes and older persons so that they could help in the treatment.
In such cases, countless cases come out daily in TV, media, newspapers and conversations.
I am extremely grateful to all the hardworking and enthusiastic colleagues in this Mahayagya.
Shakti pinnacle should be done only when crossing the sacred place .
I clearly remember that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was underway and the way the bank employees took it on their shoulders, the work that was not done in the last sixty-six years was done by them.
Today, once again, he has taken up this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective manpower of all of us will make this nation a new force and progress.
They are searching for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly, in that too, they have found a way out by using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or by doing something with them.
I would like to tell such people today that whether it is your intention to improve or not, whether it is your will or not to comply with the law, the law will see what to do.
But please do not interfere with the lives of the poor.
You do not do anything so that the poor gets the name of the poor on the record and afterwards when checked, my beloved poor gets stuck in trouble because of your sins.
And there has been such a stringent law of benami property that is being enforced in it that it will cause many difficulties and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name passes through blessings.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Tirali Taluko, Harda district and Madhya Pradesh.
I want to give several examples of Mann Ki Baat that despite being uncomfortable, people have welcomed this tough decision for the advancement of their nation which will enhance the enthusiasm of the people and that the cashless system is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have stopped the notes of thousands and five hundred rupees.
I speak Yelappa Wellankar from this village in Koppal district of Karnataka.
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart because you had said that good days will come. But no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
The notes of 500 thousand rupees, black money makers and corrupt people aware of all these things.
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this.
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this thing.
Some things are known through the medium of media, through the medium of people, through the medium of government sources, then the enthusiasm to work increases.
There is so much joy and pride that in my country the common man has such a wonderful potential.
If you get the opportunity to go back to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this route then you must pay the money.
And people go there, they go there, they go there, they pay money after two-four-four days.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to deliberate on the issue in elections and this thing has reached across the globe.
People from many countries of the world have also learnt to speak the word "Chaarcha".
But I didn't know that there would be a marriage in the discussion.
I came to know that there was a marriage in Surat on 17th November that took place with 'Chhapor Dialogue'.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter gave tea only to those who came to her wedding and did not spend anything else.
The Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat, who have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, will continue to inspire them.
When I was late at night, I used to watch TV and I saw it in the news that there is a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam.
There are tea garden workers and they get money every week.
What did they do if they got a note of Rs. 2000
Four women from the neighborhood gathered together and bought all around and paid two thousand rupees in a note so they didn't need a small note because they bought it together and decided that when we meet next week, we will sit and watch it.
People are searching for their own ways.
And also see the change.
The people of the tea gardens of Assam are saying that we should apply ATMs there.
See, how the lives of the villages are also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this mission.
The country will benefit in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipal corporation gets fifty percent tax on taxes.
However, due to this decision on the 8th of this year, all the people were running to submit their old notes.
47 urban units had a turnover of about Rs. 3,500 crore in the previous year.
You will be surprised to know that in the same week 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited.
Now if the money has been levied in that municipal corporation four times then it is natural that there will be sewerage system in the poorest of the population, there will be water management and Anganwadi facility.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are visible.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to these new changes in the economy, every citizen is organising himself in the midst of difficulties.
Farmers have also found ways in the midst of difficulties.
The government has taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority but still there are difficulties. However, I am confident that if the farmers face any problem and natural calamities, they will continue to be stuck this time too.
Small traders of our country, who provide employment, also increase economic activity.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that the small shopkeepers of the villages like the big malls will be able to do their business for twenty four hours, they will not be able to stop any legislation because it was my view that if the big mall gets 24 hours then why should not the poor poor poor poor poor poor poor poor poor poor poor people of the villages get it
A big initiative has been taken to provide loans to the Mudra Yojana.
Lakhs and crores of rupees have been provided to such small people through Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small business and give a boost to the business of billions of rupees.
However, it is natural for them to face difficulties due to this decision.
You can also download the Bankoni App on mobile phones.
You should also install POS machines for credit cards, you should also learn how to do business without a note.
Technological roads are safe and fast.
I would like you to not only help in making this mission a success but also to lead your changes and I am confident that you can lead the change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the entire village business.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a payment on the paper and is different when it comes in hand.
Sometimes a full salary is paid and sometimes a part of it is required to be paid to someone outside and in the labour force it makes it a part of life.
With this new system, we want you to be in the bank, and your salary will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
Nowadays, your mobile phones are also working as e-packets. You can purchase the same mobile phone from the small shops in the neighborhood and you can also pay the money from it.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the deprived and the deprived sections of the country that they should benefit from.
Today, I would especially like to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 of the population below 35 years of age.
Young women of my country, I know that you must have liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are also contributing immensely to this thing in a positive way.
But friends, you are my true Sipahi, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India and an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can my youngsters help me
You will help me, you will not stop talking like this.
The more experience you have in today's world, the more it is not for the older generation.
It may be that the elder brothers of your family are not aware of this thing and parents, uncles and mothers are not aware of this thing.
You know what is happening, you know what is happening online banking, you know how to book online tickets.
For you, all these things are very common and you use them as well but today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream is Cashless Society.
A hundred percent cashless society is not possible, but is it possible that India is launching a Less Cash Society
Once we have launched the Less Cash Society today, the Manzil of the Cashless Society will not be far away. And I will see your physical help, your time and your resolve.
And I believe that you will never despair of me because all of us have the desire to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, today there is a lot of opportunity for cashless society for digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank offers online access.
The direct meaning of voting is e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and the RuPay card which was used very little after 8th.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and it has registered a growth of nearly 300.
Just as the prepaid cards are received in the mobile phones, the banks also have prepaid cards for spending money.
There is a good platform for the UPI to do business so that you can purchase, send money, and you can also get the money. And this is as easy as you send it to the Whatsapp.
Sav would be an uneducated person. How can we send messages on WhatsApp today
Moreover, technology will become so simple that there is no need for a big smartphone for this purpose.
Every bank has taken it and now it has eliminated the expenditure on online surcharge and it has been seen that in 2-4 days, every expenditure has been abolished in the newspapers so that the movement of cashless society is strengthened.
My young friends, despite all this, there is an entire generation that is unaware of it.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
I see the way creative messages have been sent to you on Whatsapp, slogans, poems, cases, cartoons, innovative imaginations. And in the midst of a lot of difficulties, the creative power of our youth seems to be the hallmark of Indias soil.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I want your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I reiterate that I need your help and I am confident that millions and millions of youth of my country will do this work.
Please do one thing from today itself solemnly make a pledge that you yourself will become a part of the Cashless Society.
All the technologies that are being used online on your mobile phones are available.
Moreover, at least 10 families are being taken out every half an hour, two hours, at least 10 hours, how to use this technology, how to download their bank app and how to spend the money that has been spent on your account to the bankers
How can a shopkeeper be traded
You will voluntarily lead this cashless society, the campaign to bring the country out of the dilemma of these notes, the campaign to liberate the country from corruption, the campaign to free black money, the campaign to make people free from problems and difficulties.
Once you people are blessed with the use of RuPay cards, the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens get rid of all these concerns then they will get rid of them. And if all the youth of India are involved in this work then I dont think it will take longer.
Within a month, we will be able to emerge as a new modern India in the world and you can do this thing through your mobile phones.
You can do it everyday by going to 10 households and by adding 10 households every day.
I invite you, Come, let us not only support but we will also be an army of change.
We will carry forward this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there is a wealthy country in the world where the youth of the country has changed the lives of that nation.
Kenya, he expedited the seed, M-PESA used the technology of such a mobile system, named M-PESA and today the entire business in this region of Africa has come up.
This country has made a big revolution.
My young men, I once again urge you to take forward this mission.
Every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, collectively, I invite you to do this work personally.
Let us take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the best of the country, not to miss the opportunity.
Dear brothers and sisters, this day marks the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachhan ji and today on the occasion of birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan for this cleanliness drive.
It must have been seen that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, has been taking forward the campaign of cleanliness in a very good manner.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread to his nervous system and he remembered the work of cleanliness even on his father's birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through this.
His son, Shriman Amitabh ji, whose mission of cleanliness is running in NASSAN, he sent me through the poetry of Harivansh ji, Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, Mara Acharya.
I bow down to Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank ShrimanAmitabhJi for joining this Mann KiBaat and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, Narendra Modi always keeps me connected with you through your thoughts, feelings and letters.
Now Mann Ki Baat is about 11 o'clock, but soon after that we are going to start in regional languages too.
I am grateful to Akashwani, the new initiative that has been taken by those people so that even my countrymen will get the opportunity to connect with it where Hindi is not popular.
Thanks a lot to all of you.
From a distance, the visitors feel as if the second name of the Indian Janjeevan Utsav is also natural.
The festivals that have been a tradition of India since Vedic times have been a festival of changing times.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of festivals from time to time and the changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the demands of time and society.
And do it through these festivals.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
Today, the whole world discusses the environment, it becomes a matter of concern for nature destruction.
India's festival tradition is going to strengthen nature's love and culture from child to person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has a feeling of responsibility.
Nowadays we keep a holiday on Sunday, but the people of the older generation, the workers, the fishermen etc.
So far, we had developed a tradition of connecting the universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, as I have said, every festival is an educational festival.
One thing is well known to all of us, to every corner of India, to every corner of the country, to every corner of the country, to every corner of the country, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household, to every household.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean our homes but also to clean the entire complex, to clean the entire atmosphere and to clean the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer confined to the borders of India.
In some form or the other, the festival of Diwali is celebrated and celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world have also started becoming a part of the festival of Diwali.
Whether it is eastern or western, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, Diwali's pilgrimage is visible.
You must be aware of the fact that the US Postal Service of the United States has also released Diwali postage stamps this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his views on the occasion of Diwali.
On the occasion of Diwali in London, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organised a felicitation programme that connects all the societies, he himself participated in it.
And what is the picture
16 women MPs from Singapore are standing outside Parliament wearing Indian saris and these pictures have become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Today, the festival of Diwali is being celebrated in every street hall of Singapore.
Australian Prime Minister conveyed Diwali greetings to the Indian Community and called upon all communities to join the festival of Diwali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand had visited India.
He told me that I have to go back so soon that I am going to attend the Diwali celebrations there. What I mean is that the festival of Deepawali, this festival of light, this festival of light, is also an inspiration to take the world community from darkness to light.
On the occasion of Diwali, along with good clothes, good food and drinks, heavy chills of crackers also emerge.
And children and youth are very happy.
Never mind what has happened in the vicinity .
In the days of Diwali news of accidents, news of fire, news of immunity are causing serious concern.
And there is a problem that on Diwali, doctors too have gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is going on for a long time.
It is not just a day.
Govardhan Puja, brotherhood, Benefit Pancham, and Kartik Purnima, in a way, it continues for a very long time.
At the same time, we also celebrate Diwali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
Chhath Puja festival is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
But one of its specialties is that it gives immense messages to the society.
But there is a saying that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which worship of shining sun is also done.
There's a huge social message in this festival...
I would like to mention the festival of Diwali that Chhath Puja is going to convey my best wishes to you all.
But at the same time, I have a special time.
In particular, we have to thank and express our gratitude to our countrymen.
In the last few months, the incidents that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting their supremacy for our well-being.
My dear countrymen, the sacrifices, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces continues to cease.
And one of them was to dedicate this Diwali to the Defence Forces.
I invited the countrymen for a mission called Message to Soldiers.
However, today I want to say this thing by sacrificing my head that there is no such person in India who has a unique love for the soldiers of the country and is proud of the army and the way it has been expressed, it gives strength to every Indian.
We cannot imagine for the soldiers of the security forces. One of your messages has emerged as enlightening.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a poor, a businessman, a shopkeeper, a politician, a sportsperson or a cinema world, there must have been a missed person who has not published a lamp for the soldiers of the country, who have not sent a message to the soldiers of the country, even the media has changed this lamp into an opportunity to express gratitude towards the army and why shouldnt they
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Jal Sena, Bundelkhand or Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all, but what kind of difficulties do our soldiers face
I can imagine how proud this moment is for the soldiers of my country.
There are so many acts on the Message to Solzer 's hashtag , in reflection or what to say .
I want to read that poem has been sent by Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan.
Sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am fascinating with Shiva.
Our army brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the message to the Soldiers Mission launched on this Diwali.
I belong to a armed family.
My husband is also a military officer.
My father and mother-in-law have been the officers of both the armies.
So, the entire family is full of soldiers.
I would like to say that along with the army officers and the soldiers, their families and their wives also offer such sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not only on the border but also on every corner of their lives.
Whether it is natural calamities, whether it is law and order crisis, whether it is batting against the enemies or be it showing the courage to return the youth on the wrong path, our soldiers continue to work inspired by the patriotism of every aspect of their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh is free from flowing trees in the open - open defecation free.
Now Himachal has also been formed and Kerala is also going to be the first number.
But how does this success appear
Now these ITBP jawans went to the village on leave from their duties.
So perhaps in the village there was a need to meet the Gram Sabha at that time and it was being discussed in the Gram Sabha and toilets were being constructed.
It was found that some families were unable to make toilets due to lack of money.
Its not like that he was serving the nation just by placing pills on enemies.
He took thousands of rupees out of his chequebook and handed it over to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those five households did not have toilets, let them pay one thousand rupees to each family and construct five toilets and make our villages free from open defecation.
I am really grateful to the youngsters.
I noticed that there is no road in the far-flung areas of Kerala, which can be reached with difficulty if we walk on foot all day.
It was difficult to reach Idmalakudi, Tribal Panchayat there. Therefore, in the nearby urban areas, it was noticed by the engineering students that toilets are being constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, youngsters of NSS, students of engineering have decided that we will build toilets.
The youngsters who had to carry goods, camels, cements and all the goods that they had to build toilets, took up their shoes and went to Pella forest all day long.
They themselves worked hard to build toilets in the village and these youngsters freed up a small village in the remotest jungle.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat too has declared all municipalities - Municipal Corporations - more than 150 Open Defecation Free.
Ten districts have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on the first day of November and it has been decided that the entire state will be ODF in a few months.
He has completed seven districts so far.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I congratulate the citizens of all these states for joining this great work and contributing to removing the darkness of filth from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and if another good scheme comes up after the first scheme then we have to leave the first scheme.
Normally, there is no point in this thing.
Old schemes are going on and new schemes are also going on and await the upcoming schemes.
This is going on.
In our country, the houses that have gas connections, the houses that have electricity, these houses do not require kerosene.
The households that have gas connections, the households that have electricity have been liberated from Aadhaar numbers and I have heard that seven or eight districts have been liberated from kerosene by now.
I am confident that the entire state will become kerosene-free very soon.
And the facility of people will also increase, yes, it will be difficult, it will be difficult for the promising people, it will be difficult for the criminals.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Where should the country go And even today the criteria for all of them are set.
Gandhiji used to say, Whenever you formulate a scheme, first of all, remember the poor and the weak faces and then decide whether the poor will be benefitted by what you are going to do or not
You decide on this criteria.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes and aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the difficulties.
Whatever our old thinking may be, the society must be freed from the discrimination of girl childhood.
The 21st century and the darkness of the village cannot go on.
And that is why the great campaign of electrifying villages and villages is successfully moving forward to make them free from darkness.
Time is moving ahead in terms of time.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the poor mothers and sisters who have cooked a kitchen on a wooden stove and have taken a smoke of 400 cigarettes a day
5 crore such families are progressing successfully to provide smoke-free life, this is a cell.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk-driven, niece shopkeepers used to be stuck in the vicinity of the interests of the oppressors.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 31st October, the great man of this country, who made the mantra of his life, lived up to the unity of India.
31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on one side and the living beings of the country's unity are great men.
On the other hand, there is also the death anniversary of Smt.
We not only remember the blessings of great men but we should also do it.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab touched me too and I am calling Prime Minister Namaskar, Sir, Jasdeep.
From Punjab, sir, you know, it is Sardar Patel's birthday on the 31st.
Sardar Patel is such a wonder that he has spent his entire life connecting the country with the nation. And I feel that he has succeeded, he has brought everyone along.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a human being.
A Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the job of uniting the country after Chanakya.
Successful attempts to bring down the Indian freedom struggle, the great soul who did such a great job, bowed down to the great soul.
However, it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb was alive for unity, he was struggling for unity and because of his priorities, he was also a victim of many annoyances but he never forgot the path of unity.
The birthdays of those great men who lived for the sake of unity and the birthdays of Sardar ji are blessed with joy.
But in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There may be many languages, sexes, dresses, food and drink but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
The root cause of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Sardar Saheb's journey of life began with the struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sometimes many of our fellow citizens hear the name of Amul.
People are familiar with every manufacturing of Amul today even outside India and India.
However, very few people would be aware that it was a divine vision of Sardar Saheb who had envisioned a cooperative milk producing federation.
And sports districts, which were then called 'Kera' districts, strengthened this idea in 1942.
Similarly, today's Amul is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had created happiness and prosperity for the farmers.
I offer my homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on 31st October, we should remember Sardar Saheb, wherever we may be.
My dear countrymen, in this series of Diwali festivals, the light festival of Kartiki Purnima is also a festival.
Guru Nanakdev, his teachings are guiding not only for the entire humanity but also for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the top of the deformity of the untouchables, caste systems and sects, Guru Nanak Dev was chosen as his colleague.
If we move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', the inspiration that Guru Nanak Dev gave us, the light of the knowledge that Guru Nanak Dev had given us, who could be our guide
I also bow down to Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival of his birthday is going on.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali.
Thanks a lot...
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, a few days ago, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
This cowardly construction was sufficient to stir up the entire nation.
There is also grief and anger in the country. And it is not only for those families who have lost their sons, brothers and sisters but also for the entire country.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our forces.
We have a lot of opportunities to speak to citizens and politicians, and we also speak.
But the army does not speak, the army shows valour.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well.
Citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the anti-national potential.
And as soon as they are beginning to realize the true reality, they have moved away on the path of peace by ignoring such elements.
Every parent wants to work as soon as school-colleges are formed, the farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. are produced in the markets across India.
Economic activity is also going on well.
And, in the last few days, business has started well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, our progress and our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem, we will find ways and at the same time paving the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that rule.
The administration has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will follow it completely.
Sometimes people who think Judas are also innovative because of what we think.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot about social media recently.
Every corner of India has the opportunity to understand and understand the emotions of all kinds of people and it strengthens the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th standard had given me a different kind of idea.
He has written, I was very distraught after the Uri terrorist attack.
But the way to do something can be understood by bathing and what can be done by a small student like me
I was wondering how I could work for the country's interests.
And I made a pledge that I would study for three hours a day.
The country will become an appropriate citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of joy for me that you can imagine healthily in this environment of anger and at such a young age.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of national consciousness.
But you must be aware that when the 165 war took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji was leading us and there was such a spirit in the entire country, it was like a patriotism.
Everybody wanted something or the other and wanted to get rid of something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a tremendous effort to touch this feeling of the country in a very good manner.
And he gave the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the people of the country how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had said that there is another way of expressing patriotism between the voices of Bombay and guns for every citizen.
When Mahatma Gandhi was also running the freedom movement, when the movement was at its peak and there was a need for stability in the movement, he used to do his best to turn that intensity of movement towards constructive work in the society.
If all of us, the army, the people sitting in the administration perform their duty and if we make a constructive contribution in the spirit of patriotism and patriotism then our country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the players who went to the Paralympics have made history and their views are a victory of human emotions.
Shri Varun Vishwanath also wrote on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a great job and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only these two, but every individual of the country has got an emotional attachment to our players of the Paralympics.
Perhaps, by moving ahead from sports, the Paralympics and our sportspersons have completely changed the vision of humanity, the vision of persons with disabilities.
There is immense strength in this sentence.
This time, 17 players, including three women from our country, participated in the paralysis.
In comparison to other players, when the disabled plays, physical capabilities, sporting skills are greater than all these.
He won the Golden uadrilateral in Devendra Jhajriya Bhalafang and won the Golden uadrilateral again after 12 years.
The age increases in the age of 12 years, and once the Golden Moon wins, the spirit also decreases slightly.
However, Devendra ji showed that the condition of the body, or the rise of age, could never weaken his resolve and for the second time after 12 years he took the Golden Moon.
And he was not disabled since his birth.
He had to lose one of his hands due to the electric shock.
Just imagine, the person who attained the first Golden Moon at the age of 23 and attained the second Golden Moon at the age of 35 years has done a great job in life.
The High Jump won the Golden uadrilateral.
And Thangavelu lost his left leg at the age of 5.
Poverty too did not come under the guise of their involvement.
They neither live in a big city nor come from a middle class Amir family.
Despite passing through difficult life at the age of 21, the country was given a solemn pledge in the midst of physical difficulties.
In the name of Deepa Malik of sportspersons, the pride of embarking on a variety of winners has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in the height.
These medals of the Paralympics are not only the significance of the medals but they have done a great job in our country, in our society, in our neighborhoods, in the direction of our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Our vision of looking at the Divyangjan has changed.
Very few people would be aware of how these Divyangjans had performed in the paralysis of this time.
A few days ago, the Olympics Competition was held at the same place.
This time it has been created.
The 1500 meter race in which the Olympics Competition had the Golden Moonlight Certificates, the record was broken by Algeria's Abdullatif Baka for a short period of 1500 meters in the 1500 meter race for the Divyangs.
Moreover, I was surprised at the fact that the fourth person among the Divyangjans who did not receive any medal as a runner, however, they also ran for a shorter time than winning a gold medal in the race for the ordinary runners.
Once again, I congratulate all of our sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth scheme for the Paralympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A Mega Camp for Divyangjans was organised by the Government of India and was established by the joyous day.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to publicly dedicate a book that has stored some successful stories of differently abled persons.
There were very inspiring incidents.
I consider it important to have a world record on the land of India and Navsari.
It was successfully used to insert machines in the ears for hearing disabled persons who could not hear within eight hours.
It was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to have a three-dimensional world order established by Divyangjans in a single day.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, two years ago, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become our nature and it should be the duty of every citizen.
Now, on the second October, when it is taking two years, I can assert with confidence that awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of millions and millions of Indians.
Today we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step towards cleanliness.
That is, the country has moved ahead by 1. 25 billion steps towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is correct.
Its fruits are so good that we can see what is happening due to some such efforts.
Bus stations, railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, hawkers, children to the elderly, villages, poor, farmers, women and everyone has been contributing to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For health, for the dignity of the citizens, especially for the honour of the mothers and sisters, there should be a halt to visit the trees in the open.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in the near future in terms of Open Defecation Free (ODF).
Recently, when I visited Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will be fully accomplished on this second October.
I would like to present a scheme especially for young friends who are using technology today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and hence the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
You will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in your city by phone number 16 but you will also be able to apply for making toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Moreover, a Swachhata App has been launched to find out the status of Swachhata Grievances and grievance redressal.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
The Swachhata Abhiyan will not only be limited to Sanskrit.
Cleanliness is not enough to become a nature.
This work should be done to make waste fertilizers and for this, the government has also started policy interventions.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to purchase the compost-centrial fertilizer that is produced from waste.
And the fertilizers that the farmers want to go for their livelihood reach them.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the soil, who want to stop the losses due to chemical fertilizers, and if such fertilizers are required in a small quantity, the companies will assure them.
And ShrimanAmitabhBachchanJi is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite youngsters to develop new start-ups in waste to wealth-waste driven kitchens, develop such instruments, develop such technologies and manufacture them in affordable manner.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, a special event - Indonesian-India Sanitation Convention is also being organized.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country, all of them together have to concentrate only on cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What could be the economic structure
How can public participation be done
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All the topics are going to be discussed.
And I see that new information about cleanliness is coming up.
One day I read in newspapers that students of Gujarat Technological University went to 10 villages and started awareness campaign to build toilets.
He worked himself and contributed to the construction of nearly a thousand toilets.
Just a few days ago, you might have seen that a team under the leadership of Vingakmandar Param Vir Singh swimmed the journey from Devprayag in Ganga to Gangasagar and sent a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also created a full-fledged calendar-time paper in its respective departments.
Each department will focus on 15 days, especially on cleanliness.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Panchayati Raj Department and the Department of Rural Development, in the coming months, will work together to increase sanitation in their respective areas from 1st to 15th October.
The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Department of Consumer Affairs (DoFPI) will undertake sanitation drive for 15 days from 16th October to 31st October last two weeks.
You must have seen that today the entire campaign for cleanliness is also underway.
Earlier, a report was presented to the people of the country about the status of cleanliness by doing the survey of three cities.
Now there are more than 500 cities in the country with more than one lakh population and because of this there is a belief in every city that we are lagging behind, but the next time we will do something good.
An environment of competition for cleanliness has been created.
I hope that all of us citizens can contribute in this movement as much as we can.
The next October marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has also been completed for two years.
I have been urging you to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge that in every family, Khadi should have something or the other so that the houses of the poor can have Diwali lamps.
On the second of October, as a citizen, how can we connect ourselves with the work of cleanliness
If there is a video, send the video.
If our efforts in the entire country will once again provide a new boost to the movement, new momentum.
Remembering the virtues of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, when I asked for gas subsidy and the response given by the countrymen, it is a very inspiring event in India's national life.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the shells and used to donate the old sports meant to the families and the sports meant for the poorest of the poor people.
The wonderful pleasure that the poor kids had seen when they were playing pellets was such a thing.
Millions of workers like me who have been working with political ideology, who have given their political philosophy to describe political ideology, who have been associated with India's original politics, who have given their political philosophy to reward India's cultural heritage, have started the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal ji.
The principle of Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the people of Howrah.
How can the poorest of the poor get the fruits of development
They gave every hand the work, every farm water, in two words the entire economic agenda.
We can get rid of poverty only when the country considers his birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, the governments of the society and the welfare of the poor gets the benefits of development.
As a part of this, the road which is now known as the Rescuers Road of the British, has been named as Lok Kalyan Marg on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's birth centenary year.
This is a reflection of this centenary year of poor welfare.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, two years ago I had started Mann Ki Baat.
It has been my sincere endeavour that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to commemorate those government works.
How are the people of this country inspiring me
Is it the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which Mann Ki Baat had accorded his appreciation and the way Mann Ki Baat had improved it and blessed it.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani who not only spread these things to me but also made every effort to reach this place in all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who have opened the doors of the government by writing letters after Mann Ki Baat and by informing them about the shortcomings of the government and Akashwani has made a special programme on these letters and has provided a platform to the representatives of the government to solve the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute conversation but it is also a new opportunity for social transformation.
For anyone what other reason of this bigger satisfaction can be any other reason .
My dear countrymen, on the coming weeks, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Diwali, have a different kind of atmosphere throughout the country.
It is a festival of universal worship and the unity of the society is possible for the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can it be a festival of worship of Sagat, of the unity of the society
How to make a festival connecting with human beings
And only then can we celebrate the festival of victory by embracing it as a means of realisation.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand ji, the magician of Hockey on 2nd August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and also remind you of his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in giving India a hockey gold medal in the 128th, 132nd, 136th Olympic Games.
We all know the name of cricket lover and breadman.
He said High Scores Goals are a living example of Rance, Dhyanchandji Sportsman Spirit, and patriotism.
Once, during the match in Kolkata, an opposition team player hockeyed Dhyan Chand ji's head.
At that time, only 10 minutes left to complete the match.
And Dhyan Chand ji had made three goals in those 10 minutes and said, I took revenge for the injuries.
However, I have seen that this time I was greatly urging everyone to talk about the Rio Olympics.
I see that this kind of appreciation of the ordinary citizen for the Rio Olympics, this kind of awareness and pressure on the head of the country or something about it.
Besides cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports as well, there is so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Reading this message for me has also become a source of great inspiration in itself.
Please speak to the daughters in Mann Ki Baat on their participation in education and sports because they have made the country proud by winning the medal at the Rio Olympics.
A Mr. Sachin writes, You must mention Sindhu, Witness and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
The medals that we received were released by these daughters.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not descending from anyone in any way.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India, and the other from East India.
So someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the entire India have taken the initiative to make the country proud.
On MyGov, Summit Thakur has written, We were able to perform better at the Olympics.
He has written, "Congratulations to Honble Modi sir, the first two medals we have won in Rio, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that was our performance really good
And the answer is - no.
We need to bridge the gap in sports.
Our parents are still asking to focus on education.
Even today, sports is considered to be the worst of times in the society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs inspiration.
Thus, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny that we cannot perform as per our hopes.
It also happened that the exhibition that our sportspersons had performed in India, the sportspersons were not able to reach there.
And only two medals could be received in the medal category.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, for the first time in many sports, Indian sportspersons have demonstrated great skills.
But why can we forget that she is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympic File
Such a thing happened in tennis with the combination of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopan.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babar made a convocation for the Trek Fild Field.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women hockey team has reached the Olympics.
India's sportspersons, the coming time will certainly be good for us.
As many sportspersons, Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do what we have been doing then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
It will create a work map of how we can do better.
Just imagine, the state chooses one or two of its games and plans how it can perform excellently in it.
I also urge the associations associated with sportspersons to motivate them in an unbiased manner.
And I appeal to every citizen of India to send a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App, whichever is interested in it.
write to the government.
Associations will give their representation to the Government in the course of discussions.
State Governments interact and send their suggestions.
But we should prepare ourselves completely and I am confident that we will move ahead with the resolution of achieving a better position in the world of sports, of which 65 per cent are youth.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for many years.
However, for this time I had to go to the G-20 Summit. Today, I have come here to express my feelings in the matter of mind.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life to his disciples, to his students.
Nowadays, after the Rio Olympics, Bullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson but he has given a brilliant example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a sportsperson.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teachers' contribution is always felt in our lives.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji's birthday and the country considers it as Teachers Day.
He may have reached that place in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Moreover, he always used to say - good teachers are those who never die in their students.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji had lived such a wonderful life to keep the inner student alive as a teacher and being a teacher despite being the President's post.
I think I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
However, today I can say with joy that even if a teacher of mine is now 70 years old then even today his letter comes to me every month.
And that is why I see some good letters then I feel a lot of respect in my mind.
It is the responsibility of all of us to take pride in our teaching community.
You must present your photographs with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if there is any inspiration for your teachers.
It is also very valuable to see the contribution of a teacher in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will take place in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a scholar and we all want that the lives of our country, our society, our family, every person remain intact.
But when we talk about Ganesh Utsav, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of Ganesh Utsav is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now, not only Maharashtra, but in every corner of India, public Ganesh Utsav has started.
Essays compete, colourful competitions.
His exhibition also highlights the issues touching society in a very artistic way.
This big campaign of public education is being run by the Ganesh Utsav.
Surajya is our birth right, let us move to Suryaya now, let us become our priority. Can we not convey this message through the Ganesh Utsav
Come, I invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are possible for the society.
This time many people have sent me a lot of books on Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
Why should not we use the statue of Ganeshji made of mud of the lake of the village
Statues made of POP are not unfair to the environment.
It is Gods service that protects the environment, protects our rivers and climates and protects the small creatures of this water.
Ganesh ji is a scholar.
We should not create such a Ganesh ji that produces widowhood.
I don't know how you will take these things but I don't say this thing alone. Many people say this thing and I have heard many things - a sculptor is Shriman Abhijit Ghondfal.
Ganesh Festival is also a social service to the environment.
Durga Puja is still in time.
Today, let us decide the old family that we build.
If we buy a statue from them then they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the soil of the pond or river then we will get it again.
My best wishes to you all for the Ganesh Festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the Sant Upahi on September 4th.
Mother Teresa dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud to be proud when Mother Teresa, who has served the poor of India for the rest of her life.
On September 4, the Government of India will also send an official delegation to lead our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
We have to learn something from the saints, from the sages, from the great men every moment.
Let us keep getting something, learn something and keep doing something better.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big a change comes.
Janash Kid is considered to be the form of God.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people with the cooperation of five state governments, for clean Ganga and for cleaning the Ganga.
On 20th of this month, Sarpanches of villages along the banks of Ganga were invited to Allahabad.
Villages do not let the river Ganga get dirty, they come from Uttarakhand for this resolution.
If someone comes from Uttar Pradesh, if someone comes from Bihar then someone from Jharkhand comes from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India for realizing this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by connecting the peoples power.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch me a lot and those who are imagined by them have a special respect in my mind.
On 15th July, more than seventy-seven school students in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote to their parents.
Children aged seven to seventy years have done this thing.
Congratulations to the students who made this effort and specially congratulated the parents who decided to make their children's letter seriously toilets.
There are things that inspire us.
Mallamma, a sixteen year old daughter in Kopal district of Karnataka, respected Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
It has become a resolution of some Indians.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
However, everybody is connected to it in some way, everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and people have been asked to make a film on cleanliness for two minutes, three minutes and send it to the Government of India.
You will get details on the website.
It will compete and be rewarded for the victory on Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
I also urge the Channel makers to compete for such films.
Creative creativity can also give a boost to Swachhata mission.
New methods will be known, new motivations will be inspired and all this will be done by the common artists in public participation.
It is not necessary that there should be a big studio, a good camera to make the film.
A very important thing has happened in the past.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel. Now some people will have to inaugurate a radio channel.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, the Akashwani Friendship and Bangladesh Betar on the other hand they will share mutual goods and Bangladeshi people on both sides will enjoy the sky.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate Akashwani's friends that they are contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even if you have given me the job of becoming a Prime Minister, I believe that I am like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a bit more.
Such emotional events also give new energy and new inspiration, which inspires the people of the gate to do something or the other.
In the past, I received a letter which touched my heart.
This letter has been written to me by the retired teacher who is a mother of about 84 years.
Had he not forbidden me to declare his name in this letter, I would have spoken to him today.
In a letter, he wrote that when you requested for gas subsidy, I had abandoned the subsidy and then I had forgotten it.
Friends, you must be aware of the fact that I have tried to send a letter to those people who have left the gas subsidy and some of my delegates would send a letter to him to Rubu.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a very good job and the campaign to free the poor mothers from slaughter is excellent and I am an retired teacher.
The question is not about fifty thousand rupees but it is about the feelings of the mother and it is the blessings of such Kotikoti mothers and sisters that gives them confidence and strength for the future of my country.
I bow down to that mother and I bow down to those mothers of India who are always bent on suffering themselves.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought but this month of August was constantly filled with floods.
There have been floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, local bodies, social institutions and citizens were able to do as much as possible by the central government.
However, among these flood news, there were some news reports that needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, how big a result can be achieved if we move together, we will be remembered for the month of August this year.
In August 2016, many opposition parties, non-opposite parties and nearly 70 parties from all over the country, many parties in the Parliament, all these political parties together passed the GST bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country had talked about Kashmir in one voice.
If we put it in the least words then I would say that unity and faith - these two things remain in the basic mantra. And all of us believe that it is from the sarpanch of the village to the head of the village that if anyone dies in Kashmir then whether it is a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, it is our people, it is our country, the people who have been trying to create unrest in Kashmir by taking forward these children, sometimes they will have to answer the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to build a nation full of diversity in the bonds of unity, that we should further emphasize the importance of unity, that the country will be able to build a bright future.
My dear countrymen, I believe in the lives of millions and millions.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi this morning. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports throughout the country will paint every youngster with enthusiasm.
We all know that in just a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be held.
The word Rio will reverberate in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the performance of its players. You will also keep an eye on them.
Our hopes and aspirations are immense but those who have gone to play in Rio, it is for 125 crore Indians to enhance the enthusiasm of the players.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a grand event Run for Rio, Khelo Aur Jio, Khelo Aur Khilo.
What should we do for the promotion of our sportspersons in the coming days, wherever we may be
No matter how much food habits are, we have to leave everything behind.
Even if there is a sweet smell in the winter, one has to leave the bed and run away in the field and not only to the player but also to his parents.
The player is not making night and night.
I am also ready to do this thing on behalf of you.
To deliver your message to these sportspersons, the Prime Minister of the country is ready to become a postman.
Come, let us make every sportsperson proud in the coming days so much so that we can enhance our efforts.
And today when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem was sent by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University.
There may be many other poets who would have sent poetry, maybe they would have written poetry but some would have heard it.
Everyday technology is changing, new forms are adopted every day, new impacts are generated and it keeps changing.
You cannot capture technology.
If research and innovation do not happen, the way sea water spreads, technology also becomes a bogey.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation with the confidence of old technology then we will have to go out in the changing era of the world. And that is why we will have to give a boost to the spirit of science, research and innovation in the new generation.
Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One goal is to create an ecosystem across the country through the Atal Innovation Mission, innovation, experiment, enterprise, and this will enhance the scope of employment.
Similarly, innovation is directly linked to the Incubation Centre.
And when I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has thought of providing a huge amount of Rs. 10 crore.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We face problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And the Atal Grand Challenge has called upon the youth of the country to find solutions to the problems faced by you people with the help of technology, research, innovation and solutions.
Government of India seeks to promote and reward the technology discovered for solving our problems.
And I am glad that people are interested in talking about the fact that when we talked about the Tinkering Lab, about thirty thousand schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions of education and non-educational organisations came forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that the true homage to Abdul Kalam ji - research, innovation, technology to solve the problems of our daily lives, simplification of our problems will do as much as our new generation will do.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worried about drought and today we are also enjoying rain and the news of floods is also coming up.
The state government and the central government are making every effort to help the flood victims get their support.
Even if there are some difficulties due to rains, every human mind, every mind becomes embraced because the focus of our entire economic activity is on rain-farming.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us relieved forever.
But if we remain aware, alert and striving hard then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
Dengu has brought it.
Dengue can be avoided.
Focus on cleanliness, be cautious and be cautious, give special attention to the children and the poorest of the poor is a disease but there is no case of dengue.
Dengu is the first to come to the prosperous regions and therefore, let us understand it.
You must have seen the news on TV but sometimes we become aware of it and sometimes we are confused about taking care of it.
The government, the hospital, the doctor will do their jobs but I will pray that we dont enter dengue in our homes, in our regions, in our families and will not be cautious about any disease caused by water.
On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the dear countrymen.
Life has become so radical that it has become so busy that we dont have time to think about it.
If we fall sick then we feel like healing soon and for this we take any antibiotics and purify them in our body.
But the bacteria that are present in it are used to these medicines and then the medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then these diseases continue to cause new complications in the fighting, preparing new medicines, scientific research etc.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing such changes within themselves that there is no effect of medicines on them .
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance and hence it is important to follow the rules of using antibiotics .
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
Though the maternal mortality rate has come down in the last one decade, the lives of very large pregnant mothers cannot be saved even today.
During pregnancy or during blood deficiency , congenital infections , high BP , unknown complications can ruin their lifetime .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new mission in the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, on 9th of every month all pregnant women will be provided free medical check-up at Government Health Centres.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give 12 days a year for the poor
I have written several letters in the past.
Thousands of doctors have moved ahead with my words.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I am sure you will join me.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna talks about the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says, "World: Sarvrikshana, I drink in all the trees.
As stated in the Surakshacharya Policy, Nasti Maula Anaushadhan is not a herb without any medicinal properties.
The Discipline Festival of Mahabharata has discussed it in many ways and it has been said that the trees that flow are the origin of the trees.
There is no doubt about it.
The tree that is donated to it is like a tree in the world as well.
A few days ago, I came across an example of a daughter Sonal of Pune that touched my heart.
In the philosophy of Mahabharata, it has been said that trees also fulfil the responsibilities of childhood in the entire world, so that not only their parents, but also the desires of the society are fulfilled.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring manner in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra.
When I saw a picture of them in social media, it was surprising that even though there were no jinns in the wedding, the plants were visible all around.
The sight of the picture was very cordial.
In a way, the wedding of Sonal became an immortal story of nature's love, and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatrejee for this new endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pilgrims visiting the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
And I would like to tell them that this is the blessings of the mother and if you worry about making this plant big by visiting your village then mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pedestrians used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed that year.
The temple can also initiate the tradition of planting in these seasons instead of prasad.
It can become a simple mass movement of treehood.
I have repeatedly told the farmer brothers that if we waste our land on the banks of our farms then why should we not do timber cultivation instead of jute
If we plant such trees on the banks of our farms that are used for furniture and housing then it can be sold after fifteen-twenty years with the permission of the government.
And it can also be a new source of income for you and India can also avoid importing a timber.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan - Marubhoomi - We have done such a big festival and we have pledged to plant twenty five lakh plants.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan know how big a seed has been raised.
The Prime Minister said that he has resolved to increase his green cover by fifty percent.
The central government has started the Green India Mission, under which the railways have speeded up this work.
There is a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav in Gujarat too.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Van, Martyrdom Forest in Gujarat have been taken up in the form of Van Mahotsav and have been running a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they also deserve to be praised.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage.
When we recall South Africa, it is quite natural for us to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness come to light in the face of Gandhiji and Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoenix Satellite, which is known as Mahatma Gandhis residence, Sarvadaya.
I am also fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel by the train on which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train which had planted a seed to become Mahatma Gandhi, that Peter Maritzberg Station.
But what I want to say, I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who had laid down their lives for equality and equal opportunity and had fought with Nelson Mandela.
Twenty-twenty-two years ago, Nelson spent his life with Mandela in jail.
In a way, he had cautioned the entire youth and I was fortunate to visit the friends of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Tathada, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bezori and Ronnie Casserils.
The manner in which the symptoms of the duties described in the Gita appeared to be quite evident.
My heart will be reminded of that visit.
Equality and equal opportunity cannot be a bigger mantra for any society and government.
Priority may be different, but the path is the same. And that is the path of development, equality, equality of opportunity, equality of feeling and maternal feeling.
Let us take pride in our Indian diaspora who has lived the roots of our lives in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who have conveyed my message and their concerns are very natural.
I am saddened by being a woman.
And some people get entangled in the fascination of money.
A new method of looting through this technology is spreading around the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a short while they came to know that everything has been looted.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
Artificial paintings are drawn at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must visit the station.
From many railway stations in India today, I have received such news and local people are presenting the identity of their areas on the walls of railway stations through their art.
A new feeling is being experienced.
This is an example of how public participation can lead to behavior.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, especially to my colleagues from Aligarh.
And you will also be joining the festival at home and outside as well.
We have special significance in Rakshabandhan's festival.
Like last year, can you not provide Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Just imagine, give such a gift to sisters who are truly safe in their lives.
And today is social security.
Today, Rakshabandhan has the true meaning.
My dear countrymen, there are many people among us who were born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in a free India.
The entire nation should be painted in the colours of the freedom fighters. Once again, we should create this atmosphere by feeling the aroma of freedom. And the Freedom Festival should not be a government programme but a programme of the countrymen.
We should be a festival of ours like Diwali.
I hope you too will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Whatever you want, your talk should also be kept on the ramparts of the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the technology platform is so simple that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes several programmes during the holidays.
And because there is a situation of a person in the holidays, it is also a matter of mind that one should enjoy the man.
And sometimes there is a feeling that if you get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it is good.
But the terrible heat of this time has spoiled all the fun all around.
But I have seen that even citizens do a very good job.
Awareness is visible in many villages and people know what is the value of water.
And that is why there is a sensitivity about water and there is activity in doing something.
A few days ago someone had told me that Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Maharashtra have solved water in the form of a very sensitive question in the village.
We have decided to grow the crops that used the maximum amount of water, be it sugarcane or banana.
It sounds very simple to hear, but it is not so easy.
And everybody went to the horticulture and vegetable cultivation that requires minimum water.
They have taken so many initiatives like fountains, drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting and water conservation that today this village has got its own strength to deal with the water crisis.
Yes, I am talking about Bajar village on a small hill but there will be several such villages.
I also thank all the villagers for their excellent work.
Someone has told me that there is a Gorwa Gram Panchayat in the Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
This Panchayat has tried to make Khet Tawdas.
Although water is saved, but when water level rises, there is also a big improvement in water quality.
Sometimes it seems that when the Indian government provided water to Latur by train, it became a news for the world.
It is true that the speed at which the Railways has done this thing deserves to be appreciated, but the people of Pela village deserve similar praise.
I would like to say that more than the railways are praiseworthy.
However, many such schemes which are being implemented by the citizens are never confronted.
The nature of the person, however, may be passing through a lot of difficulties but whenever good news comes, he feels that the entire crisis has been removed.
This year, it has come to light that the rainfall is likely to be 106 percent to 110 percent, as if a message of great peace has come to light.
Though it is time for the rains to come, the news of good rainfall has also brought a new consciousness.
The good news gives us just as much joy as it gives us a chance, it also throws a challenge.
Can we have a campaign to save the village water from now on
Farmers need soil and they work to grow that crop in the fields.
This time why do not we take soil from the lakes of the village and take it to the fields
This will also improve the land of the farm and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Whether water can be stopped by filling up cement bags, empty fertilizer bags, dust and soil
If water stops for five days, if water stops for seven days then water will fall into the ground and water level will rise in the ground.
Our wells will have water.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
So even if there is water crisis and drought, we have time for the next one and a half months.
And I have always said that whenever we visit Porbandar on the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, we will find a place in the different places where we want to see what kind of buses below the house have been constructed to save rain water and how pure water remains in it.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come up, several schemes have been formulated and blockades have been incurred. Therefore, it is very natural for millions and millions of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna to face this question.
Ganga is a mokshadayini for those who have religious beliefs.
I will accept this greatness, but I feel more that the Ganga is a lifeline.
Ganga provides us a new energy to live through it.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
We have brought Ganga but crores of neighbours are required to save it.
This cannot be accomplished without public participation.
And that is why we all have to become a representative of change for sanitation, sanitation and cleanliness.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to provide full support to the states that have been formed along the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
We have also taken several steps to prevent supplementary and industrial pollution.
Everyday, solid waste is washed away by drains and poured into the Ganges.
In order to clean such waste, the Trash Skimmer at Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. works to clean waste water immediately.
These machines have been provided to all local voluntary organizations and they have been requested to continue and clean the garbage from there.
And in the past, I have been told that there is a very good effort and at the same time garbage is being removed from 3 to 11 tonnes per day.
The waste or blacklinker emitted from the pulp and paper industry is almost completely closed.
All these are indicative of the fact that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he certainly says that if the Ganga will be cleaned.
So, the people who have faith in it will certainly succeed in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This system is being run in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system has started in our country.
And today gradually the Panchayati Raj system in the entire country is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic system.
Therefore, in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India launched the Bharat-Daya Abhiyan from 14th April to 24th April.
And today on the 24th of this day, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand where our most tribal brothers and sisters live.
Once again, on the occasion of Panchayati Raj Day, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness.
How can democratic institutions be strengthened at the village level in every corner of India
How to make the village self-reliant
How can the village plan its own development
A daughter's birthday should be a festival of village.
There are several such schemes.
Food donation programmes were organised in some villages.
Perhaps this kind of programmes have been running for 10 days in all these villages of India.
I congratulate all the State Governments and Sarpanches of the villages for this.
In a very original way, with innovation, this entire movement has been transformed into an opportunity for the development of villages, for the strengthening of democracy.
The kind of awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India's rise.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question for you about education in school colleges.
Over the years, there has been a need for reforms in the education sector.
For example, lack of adequate schools or colleges or quality in education.
Today, if the parents have a first dream in every family then they have good education for children.
Homes, cars, everyone gets the idea.
And for a country like India, this feeling of the people's mind is very powerful.
There should be greater awareness and anxiety about good education to educate and teach children.
And the children also become aware that I will go to school for this work.
And that is why I would urge all the girls and parents to talk to the children in detail about the activities being done in the school.
And if we consider anything then we should go to school and talk to the teachers.
This opportunity can also reduce many evils from our education system.
So, in a way, an attempt to spread education all around was a priority.
And it was also necessary.
However, the greater the importance that is going to spread now is the improvement in our education.
We have done a very big job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education will now be our priority due to literacy drive.
Entrance, entrance, mantra continued to cheer, but now the children who have reached school, we have to focus on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
But it is true that we need to bring about reforms from the base.
This time you must have seen in the budget that work has been done by chewing chila.
In the Budget, he has asked ten Government Universities and ten private universities to come out of Government bonds and come out on a challenging path. Let us tell you what you want to do to become the top university.
This scheme has been formulated with the intention of giving them complete freedom.
Universities of India can also become globally competitive universities.
Along with this, the importance of education is equally important.
Similarly, technology will also play a big role in education.
Remote distance education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I believe that the results will be visible in the near future.
People have been asking me on one subject for a long time.
Some people write on the web portal MyGov.
Some people write to me on the Narendra Modi App and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, sports is important not only for the youth but also for the youth.
So one day I also got the opportunity to talk to all of you before that.
The result was that I had just called a meeting in which NCC was headed, head of NSS, head of Scouts Guides, head of Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra.
And when I asked them when they had gathered earlier, they said, "No, my brother, the first such meeting was held after the independence of the country.
I have got that benefit in my childhood. And I also believe that a new life of these organizations should be fulfilled and a new strength should be laid.
This time I have put some topics in front of them.
Brothers and sisters, why dont our youth, all the organizations do a great job of water conservation in this environment
Which programmes can we create to connect the country
What can be the normal youth of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their work culture and programmes
If you write on my Narendra Modi App then I will be able to reach the right place.
Such a situation will certainly happen.
My dear countrymen, I have told you that today we are compelled to think.
I also see it as a matter of intriguing people.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country is such that in the last few elections, there used to be discussions on which side would give gas cylinders
And every political party felt that if the middle class had to reach out to the polls then the issue of gas ballasts was very big.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize them to reduce the subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were set up in which several big proposals and suggestions were made for reducing gas subsidy.
These committees used to spend crores of rupees behind.
But the thing was going on there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But it was never thought out of it.
My countrymen, I am glad that today I have followed the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy.
But if we calculate then we came to know that there were more than 80 percent of those families in this one crore families who had come out of the queue after distributing their produce.
One incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if it happens to the economies of the world then it will result in the economic equations.
For them, the limits of their thoughts are outward, and somebody has to think about it.
I would like to especially urge the entire political fraternity to make a point where we trust the people everywhere.
You must not have imagined that we will get the result.
And we should go in this direction.
Please rely on the one who is sending the marks through his examination.
Sometimes I feel that we should make a declaration that no ticket will be checked in the railway payrolls today.
Every newspaper and News Channel contains every breaking news.
Isn't there any good in the country with a population of 1. 25 billion
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that just publish positive news on the prior to the paper.
He used to say this thing continuously.
A few days ago, a newspaper had also written to me, he said, We have decided that we will not give any negative news on Monday.
Good news becomes the biggest cause of inspiration.
However, it is true that the more we strengthen goodness, the less space will be for evils.
If we light the lamp then darkness will go away and it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji has given a good suggestion but please do not be angry with me.
Let us all strive together to make a positive difference, let us strive to speak positively.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Congregation can also be a tourist attraction.
Very few people around the world will be aware that for such a long time crores of people will come to the bank of the river.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading the photographs of the Singhstha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India to compete with the State Tourism Department.
Photo Competition and tell people to upload beautiful pictures in beauty.
How will the environment be created at a rapid pace and people will also be aware of the diversity of the Kumbh.
So this can be done for sure.
Yes, it is true that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh had met me and he used to say that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that there should be cleanliness.
People from there also take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh may be a religious-spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
How can we enhance the love of water, how can we increase the faith of water and how we can use this Kumbh Mela to give a message of water conservation
My dear countrymen, I am going to meet you once again in the evening on this important day of Panchayati Raj.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You might remember that the last time I had talked about a book about Premchand ji's stories and we had decided that I would share a few things with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared information on several books.
I felt good that people are discussing and discussing books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
Yes, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to admit that now I cannot spend much time in reading books.
However, one advantage is that I am getting the opportunity to know about the many books when you people send them in writing.
But from the experience of last month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why should we create a permanent Books Corner on the NarendraModiApp And whenever we read new books, write about it and discuss it.
And you can also mention a good name for our books corners.
I want this books corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Keep reading, writing and sharing it with all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made for water conservation across the country.
People have been told about traditional methods and methods.
The media also respects many innovative initiatives on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, everything is doing something at war footing.
Seeing the capabilities of the community, it feels very good and satisfactory.
As far as Ranchi in Jharkhand is concerned, the enthusiasm that the villagers have shown about water management in Aara Karam village of Orenzi block has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of Ishaan Bharat, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, those crops are being promoted which require less water and the farmers are not harmed.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with the farmers and inspired them to stuff from traditional farming for less water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Many fairs are also organized on the occasion of festivals.
Why should we not use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and especially the achievements of the children, their bravery gives us a new energy. And that is why today I feel like talking about some children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Monish Joshi, Deenshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Naga, Atharva Deshmukh, Arunatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Al-Manda.
What I will say about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that frightens the whole world.
It seems that death is at the entrance but all these ten children have not only defeated a fatal disease like cancer in their lives but have also brought laurels for India in the entire world with their valour.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports event in which the Young Cancer Surveyors participate in the lives of those who have emerged out of cancer.
Competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organized in the competition.
All these ten champions of our country have won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I firmly believe that you must have been proud of India's success across the sky, in space, in Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjiv Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Aurobindo Rao, several such people from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and he has urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, 2017 has been very good for India in terms of space.
Our scientists left A-SAT in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
There was not much discussion of big and important news such as A-SAT during the election race.
We have achieved the capability of breaking the satellite in just three minutes, three hundred kilometers away from the A-SAT missile.
India became the fourth country to achieve this goal. And on 22nd July, the entire country proudly saw that Chandrayaan-2 took off from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me what two major teachings I have received from Chandrayaan 2 then I will say that these are two synonyms - Faith and Faith and Fearlessness.
We must have faith in our talents and capacities, we must have faith in our talents and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
It is Indian in terms of objective and spirit.
It is a fully indigenous mission.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-Ben by resolving all the technological problems day and night in the record time.
The entire world has seen this great penance of scientists.
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that we have the capability to achieve these things.
I sincerely hope that the Chandrayaan 2 mission will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In fact, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly awaiting the month of September when the Lander Vikram and Rover Pragya will land on the Moon surface.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country and invite the youngsters of the country for a quiz competition.
Our space-related curiosity, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology - will be the key topics of this quiz competition, such as what to do for rocket launch.
How the satellites are installed in the room and what information do we get from the satellite, what is A-SAT, what is happening
I urge young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge schools, girls, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools a victory.
The most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the most meritorious students from every state to Sriharikota at their own expense and in September they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan will be landing on the lunar surface.
This will be a historic event in their lives for these winning students.
But for that you will have to participate in the quiz competition, get the maximum marks and you will have to win.
Friends, You must have missed my suggestion.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our thoughts have given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago, today is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness but the way the cleanliness drive has been successful from ODF to public places, it is the power of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days back, I was watching Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother India.
He has taken the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful some time ago.
He started the Lodhi Garden with his team.
Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the Over Bridge and Schools to the slums, when he started covering his pockets, people also got the support and this sequence started.
You might remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street painting during the Kumbh.
I came to know that Brother Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in this.
Though there is no sound in the colors and in the lines, the sense of humor that is produced from the pictures is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this thing in the beauty of Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us that the culture of making West to Wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making garbage litter.
My dear countrymen, I have read a very interesting stamp on MyGov in the past.
This comment was from the brother Mohammad Aslam who lived in Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, Mann Ki Baat is keen to listen.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June.
I feel that such programmes should be organized every three months.
Besides, there should be online monitoring of the programme.
I think that was the first such programme in which people had a direct interaction with the government.
Brother Aslam ji sent me the message and after reading it my curiosity about the Back to Village has increased. And when I came to know about it from the region, I felt that the entire country should also know about it.
The people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the mainstream of development and they are enthusiastic about it.
The programme lasted for weeks and government officials in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state informed the people of the village about the details of government schemes and programmes.
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How to increase their income
What can be the impact of their services in the lives of the common man The people of the village also showed their problems free of charge.
Friends, This programme was not only recognised that the officers would return to the villages all day long but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
It also included several other things to make the programme interesting.
Sports Competition for Children was organized under Khelo India.
Further, Sports Kit, MGNREGA Job Card and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became a part of this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel one day or one and a half days on foot after passing through difficult roads.
These officers also reached the border panchayats, which are always in the auditorium of cross-border shooters, and also in the highly sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so impressed by their welcome that they stayed in the villages for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance and it also proves that the power of development is always heavy on the strength of the bomb.
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstacles, can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented something like this in one of his poems in the month of Shravan.
In this poem, he has said - "In fact, the bondage of rainforest and water currents is unique and the earth is bewildered by its beauty.
Throughout India, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
In this season, whenever we look around us, it seems as if the earth has covered a green sheet.
During this time, the festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that during the last four years, most of the devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July till date.
More than the number of pilgrims who had participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time they have joined in just 28 days.
I especially commend the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey become admirers of the feeling of sympathy and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months since the start of the Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
After the severe disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there for the first time.
I appeal to all of you to visit those parts of the country whose beauty blossoms a lot during the monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps, there can be no greater teacher than this.
My best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and lively month of Shravan. Let us share new energy, new hopes and new aspirations.
Similarly, it is reminded of the uit India Month of August.
However, when we look at TV then we get to see only one aspect of rain-filled water, traffic jam on all sides.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your children's examination.
But if we change our ways and means of examining the examinations then perhaps we can be relieved of our concerns.
In my last episode Mann Ki Baat, I said that I am delighted to share your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
The teachers, whose career has been very successful, have been sent to me by parents and some thinkers of the society.
I will talk about something that I have heard, what I have read and what I have told you.
Whatever I feel, I will be excited.
I would like to share with you the message that Bharat Ratna Shri Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India who are proud of.
You must work hard, but set a real target for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought that I would expect myself and fulfill my goals.
However, I am fulfilling this goal and I am fulfilling it. I certainly do something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on words and goals gradually gained momentum.
I would like to tell you that it is very important for you to have your thoughts positive.
Why is competition
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why should we not compete with ourselves
Why should we not decide to break all our old records
You lice, you will not be able to stop moving forward.
And when you break your old records then you will find satisfaction for your happiness, for your satisfaction and for your satisfaction.
Friends, do not consider exams as games of statistics.
Don't get stuck in the corner of your reach.
Life should be linked to some great objective.
We should move ahead with our dreams and commit ourselves.
Whether these exams are going to be true or not, our speed is correct or not.
And that is why if dreams are immense, then the exams will become a festival of joy.
Every examination will be a step towards accomplishing this noble cause.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
And do not be confined to what will happen this year and what will happen in this examination.
Walk with a very big objective and if nothing is less than expected then it will not be disappointed.
And it will go a long way in making efforts.
Thousands of people have written to me small things on my app from mobile phones.
Christen Gupta has stressed that healthy mind remains in the body.
Students, along with your studies, also take care of your health so that you can write properly in the examination.
Now, on the last day I would not like to say that you should start a campaign and go for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that what is your daily routine especially during the examination days.
Our 365 days must be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with one thing from Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has specifically urged him to sleep on time and revision should be done after waking up in the morning.
One should reach the examination centre by taking the entrance paper and other things ahead of time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said this thing that I may not hesitate to say this because I am a little sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends keep complaining to me that you are sleeping very less.
And this is possible.
I am not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable when there is a slight problem in one part of our body.
Not only this, our daily routine also becomes distraught.
And that is why we do not consider any issue as small.
You don't get stuck in your habit of compromising with licensing.
Fix it, do it.
Friends, sometimes I have seen that the students who go for exams have two types of students.
You must have seen two kinds of students.
If anyone can do this thing better than me, then it is a mastery in checking and the big players of the world who have checked it out.
Viswanathan Anand, Champion of the Tawa Chase will share his experience.
Come, let us learn from them how to check in this examination.
Hello, I am Vishwanathan Anand. First of all, my best wishes to you on your exams.
I will talk a little about the examinations and experiences given by me.
The examinations seem to be like problems in life afterwards.
When you play, you don't know what kind of study will be there, even in classes you don't know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have sufficient sleep, you will get the right answer which will give you the brain at that moment.
Therefore, stay calm.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself, don't keep much expectations.
As a challenge, I remember the lessons I have learnt during the year. I can solve the problems.
In the last minute, the topics that you don't remember properly should be passed out of these important things.
You can recall some details with teachers or students which will help you in the course of examinations.
If you repeat the questions that are difficult then it will be fresh in your minds and you will be able to write them very well in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, take a very deep sleep, don't be very confident, and don't be disappointed.
Therefore, have full faith in yourself.
Vishwanathan Anand has indeed spoken very importantly.
Sometimes we used to listen, Arjuna's life was accompanied by a bird watching him.
If sad sadness is going on, if you are moving in the last minute, then you will not be able to calm down.
Let's laugh, let's laugh, let's say jokes with friends, let's see, the atmosphere of peace will be created only when you see it.
You can imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and beautiful things are visible below the pond.
But if suddenly stones start flowing in some water and vomiting starts in the water then what can be seen the beautiful things that were seen in the pond
If water is calm then things may not be as deep as they are visible.
But if the water is very turbulent then there is nothing below.
Then I feel that if I don't feel a bit lighter then I will feel better.
So I myself have evolved my technology.
It can be my experience that will help you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my App - We feel comfortable with friends and family for at least half an hour every day. And Gappa Mai has said this very important thing because most of us want to sit down to calculate the extent that we have done the right thing.
We are trapped in it.
Friends, do not do this.
Just come out and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji's talk is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while describing it in the present context, is trying to bring this culture of the country and the world to Sarita.
Such revered Muraribapuru has also sent several important stamps for the students.
And he is not only a teacher but also a thinker and hence there is a combination of diversity in his speeches.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy by accepting the situation.
You will certainly succeed in your exams if you move ahead without stress and joyful thinking. Even if you do not succeed, it will not be an exaggeration and it will be a pride for you to succeed.
I am also grateful to the revered Mr. Muraribabu for giving us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
I see that the people who have shared their experiences this time have certainly discussed Yoga.
Well, friends, let me clarify today, it will be unfair to you if you start doing yoga tomorrow morning.
But it is true that whether it is in the student life or in the second half of life, Yoga is a big key in the journey of development of space.
Ease of doing business.
Look, if you can do it, you can do it.
I have great faith in it.
It's not like that, my friend.
However, if we read the suggestions then perhaps we have copied that, yes, it is okay, let me go the same way.
And I would urge you to go for five minutes but you must read the instructions.
For the first time, it seemed to me that I didn't get it, but when I read the same thing again, I noticed that no question was asked in other ways but this is the same thing that I don't understand the questions.
Rao, he emphasized on patience.
In very few words, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Come, listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
From Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
Rao speaks.
I believe that it is natural to have anxiety because of the examination.
And these are competitive exams.
Don't worry, you do a good job.
I say the same to my young friends.
Always remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
Strength, devotion and penance should be in you.
With such a quality, you will be successful in every exam and other efforts.
Goodblase, how is the way to talk about a scientist
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
Whatever he has said - devotion, penance, this is the same thing - dedication, determination, diligence.
If you feel like you will be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do a good job.
Now, my app has given a message on the experience of exams from the right.
He said that his family is constantly trying to create a positive environment during examinations.
It is true that Sachin ji also said that Positive Approach, Positive frame of mind.
We read in our syllabus about the researcher Thomas Lwa Edition of Electricity Guarantee.
Friends, how many years did it take for them to do this thing how many years did it take for them, how many times did it take for them, how much time did it take for them, how much money was spent, how much depressed it was due to failure.
But today this electricity and this bulb also illuminates our lives.
It is said that the possibility of success is hidden even in failures.
Who does not know Shrinivasa Ramanujan One of the calculators of modern times - Indian Mathematician, you must know.
His formal education did not include numerous subjects, nor did he receive any special training.
However, he contributed immensely to various sectors such as Mathematical Analysis, Number Theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved at any time.
The Harry Potter series is popular all over the world today, but it was not the case in the beginning.
They had to bear many difficulties.
Rolling said that in the face of difficulties, he used to apply the entire energy to what was really important for him.
Nowadays, the examination is not only for the students but also for the entire thinking and for the entire school and the teacher.
But the situation is not good if the student is alone without the support of the girl and the teacher.
The examination becomes easier if all the teachers, maidens or senior students come together to form a unit and move forward in a planned manner with a uniform idea.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app: He has complained that the parents should never pressurize them to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged only to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Build a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, be it your daughter or daughter, what kind of conferences are there
You will also be able to see those conferences.
Friends, one thing is certain, especially I want to tell the young friends that the lives of our people have changed much more than our older generations.
Every moment, new discoveries, new technologies, new colours of science are visible.
And this is not the only thing we are proud of.
We also want to move ahead with the scientific pursuit.
I am doing this because today is National Science Day.
The Vigyan Mahotsav of the country is being celebrated on 28 February as National Science Day.
28 February, 2018, 128 sq.
Rumon announced his search for Roman Effect.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
The curiosity is of science.
And new discovery cannot be possible without science and technology.
Emphasis should be laid on innovation in the country on this National Science Day.
Knowledge, technology and all these things should become a comfortable part of our development journey.
This time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Drive Innovations.
Friends, sometimes success comes after a long time and when success comes, the vision of the world changes.
If you are very busy in exams then you may be aware of the fact that a lot of news has not been recorded in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important discovery of science in the world.
The world's scientists worked hard, the generations went on doing something and after nearly a hundred years a success took place.
The exploration of Gravitational Waves has emerged from the males of our scientists.
This research is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery does not just authenticate the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the past century, but is a great discovery for physics.
This entire mankind will work for the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are glad that the sons of our country were associated with the honourable scientists of our country in the entire research process.
Our scientists will continue to strive for further research in the future too.
India will also become a partner in international efforts.
And my countrymen, we have made an important decision in the last few days.
In order to achieve even greater success in this discovery, the government has decided to open the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which is called Lego in India.
By joining India, this process will get new energy and new momentum.
India will surely become an active partner in this multi-scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to all the scientists.
From tomorrow onwards, you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by placing a message on that number.
You will also be able to listen to your mother tongue.
The number of messed-ups is 8108-8108.
81908-81908 posts, your examination is underway.
You know, the budget is tomorrow.
All of us celebrated the Christmas Festival and are now preparing for a new year's reception.
India is full of diversity.
In a way, every festival waits for another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where there is a festival economy.
This becomes the reason for the economic activities of the poorer sections of the society.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on behalf of me and my best wishes to you all for the New Year of 2016.
The year 2016 brings a lot of happiness to all of you.
New zeal, new zeal and new resolve will take you to new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Savleshwarkar has written to me that this weather is the environment of tourists.
A large number of tourists from India and abroad come here.
People also go for breakfast holidays.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the better India's image in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh ji and I am conveying the message of Ganesh ji to the countrymen.
And we say, "Guest of Honour", whenever we have to visit a hospital.
And, in our tourist destinations, in our visiting places, in our pilgrimage destinations, this is indeed a special emphasis.
However, they are ordinary workers and they work hard and work hard.
He has done a wonderful job that has been published by the newspapers.
And when this thing came to my notice, I also felt that I had come to you.
In Bhojpura, he has constructed 100 toilets so far, considering that this work is a sacred work without his hard work and hard work.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear depression about the country.
And that is what makes the country proud and it is natural for them to take pride in Mann Ki Baat for Dilip Singh.
This is the result of the untiring efforts of several people that the country is progressing very fast.
125 crore Indians are moving ahead with one step by one step and the country is also taking the lead.
New opportunities for better education, better skills and employment.
It is a big task to provide easy loans under the MUDRA Yojana to the common family members who cant afford to reach the bank doorsteps.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna When Balkrishna opened his mouth and visited the entire universe of Mother Yashoda.
The incident of Yoga has made India self-reliant.
In a way, the issue of cleanliness has been resonating in the households.
Citizens' participation is also increasing.
Perhaps, the people living in the cities who use electricity can never guess the extent of the enthusiasm and zeal that the villages that will have to face due to the darkness of their villages.
It has not been discussed widely in the media but I am confident that the media will reach out to such villages. And the biggest benefit will be that those employees of the government who are working in this direction will be satisfied and they will be so happy that they have done something that will bring about a change in the lives of a village.
Whether it is a farmer, a poor, a young man or a woman, should all these services be reached or not
Therefore, it should not be possible to know which government has done and which government has not worked.
But, therefore, they should not let them go if they are entitled to this.
Should they also get information for their rights
We should try that the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of a service.
I have made a small effort in my own way to do this thing.
I can't do everything alone.
But should I do something from what I am doing
Even a common citizen can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and connect with me.
And I keep sharing these small things on them.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that people also tell me a lot.
How can I reach without your help
Come, let us together share the interests of the common man in the language of the common man and inspire them to get their rights.
This was followed by a discussion in all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India is launching the entire Action Plan Action Plan of Startup India, Stand Up India.
And in this programme, IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, NITOs, whichever are youngsters from all over the country will be connected through Live-Connectivity.
For example, whether it is digital world or IT business, this startup is for them.
No, we have to bring about a change in it as per the requirement of India.
Market will be available.
In the same way, is the intellectual property of our youth limited to certain cities
This idea is wrong.
The youngsters in every nook and corner of India are blessed with talent.
These Startup India, Stand Up India should not be sufficiently limited to certain cities.
And I urge the state governments to take this forward.
On January 16, I will be present before you and will interact extensively with you and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Friends, 12th January marks the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanandji.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanandji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12 January to 16 January.
And I have come to know that this is their theme because their theme is based, that the theme is very good. I have been told of the Indian Youth: of Development Skills and Harmony that more than 10,000 youth are going to be gathered from all the states, from every nook and corner of India.
Young India is about to create a vision.
In a way, dreams have to be fulfilled.
The resolution is about to be realized.
Can you suggest me about this youth festival
I especially urge the young friends that I am the Narendra Modi App.
So I will wait, my friend, to know about your thoughts on the Narendra Modi App about the Festival of Jubilee.
Dilip Chauhan of Ahmedabad Gujarat, a visually challenged teacher, celebrated Excellent India Day in his school.
He has conveyed his heartfelt condolences to me by phone, Sir, and accompanied by the Excellent India Summit in my school.
We enjoyed schooling and inspired children to help the disabled in the society.
I feel that this was the first time that you have done.
Dilip ji thank you very much.
And you yourself have been working in this field.
If you understand these things very well then there will be a lot of difficulties.
Sometimes there is a chance for such an individual to be found in the society, then some thoughts come to our minds.
We also express our vision to visit them as per our thinking.
Several words have been used in the world for such people but there has always been contemplation of words.
Every time people feel that it is not good for them to recognize this word, it is not honorable.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I was going to attend that programme.
However, in some districts of Tamil Nadu and particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu, programmes were organised so that I could not attend the campaign launch programme on that day.
But it was supposed to go to that programme.
At that time, I had thought that the Paramatma who had given some deficiency in the body, who had done some harm, whom one organ used to work properly, he was also called a disabled person and he knew it as a disabled person.
But when they come to know about them, they come to know that we see a deficiency in their eyes but God has given them some special protection.
After that, I got the idea that we feel that it is a disabled person but it feels that he has some extra power.
And then I thought that why should not the word Divyang be used in place of disabled persons in our country
These are the people who have such organs that are different from one organ, which have diabetes and the transmission of persons with disabilities, which we do not have in common body.
I like this word very well.
My countrymen, can we develop the habit of word 'Divyang' instead of disabilities
I assure you that you will take this forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, we will make it easier for the people with disabilities by amending the inter-operable framework both physically and indirectly.
Schools, bus stations, railway stations, ramps, accessibility parking, accessibility lifts, braille lipids, how many things are there.
In order to simplify their availability, they need innovation, technology, system, sensitivity.
We have picked up the seed of this work.
People's participation is also being received.
They should not be dead in files.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the beneficiaries of schemes are easily benefitted.
Subsidy is being given to gas cylinders in our country.
The government has made some changes in it.
Be it Jan Dhan Accounts or Aadhaar Aadhar cards, the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (LDBT) provides the subsidy directly to the bank account of the beneficiaries.
The scheme is known as Pahal and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people using cooking gas have become beneficiaries of Pahal Yojana.
Government money has started directly entering the bank accounts of 14 crore people.
No middlemen, no recommendations, no corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar, on the other hand the opening of Jan Dhan Account, on the third hand the State Government and the Government of India together prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiary's account through various schemes.
I have a glimpse of the fact that about 35 to 40 schemes are being directly incorporated into the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, a golden moment of the Republic Day of India on 26th January is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of our Constitution.
A special discussion was held in the Parliament for two days and it was a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs, had a very good discussion on the sanctity of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the real understanding of the Constitution etc.
We should move forward in this regard.
Can Republic Day truly connect people to the system
Our constitution gives us a lot of rights and the officers are discussed in a cordial manner and should also be there.
But the Constitution also emphasizes duty and obligation.
But it has been observed that the discussion of duty is very rare.
Most of the time when elections are held, there are publications all around, it is written on the walls, hoardings are placed, it is our sacred duty to vote.
There is a lot of talk of duties at the time of voting, but why do not there be any obligations in adventurous life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we compete in schools, colleges, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations by organising a competition on duties and duties, poetry competition, orientation etc
What a great history can be achieved if one-and-a-half crore Indians move forward with duties.
Can you send me that
I want to know your thoughts.
Send it to me on my portal MyGov.
I would definitely like to know what the youth of my country thinks about it.
I feel like making a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, we are citizens, children of school colleges, statues of great men in our city.
And I am not saying this thing about the government.
Can we make it easier for us, for the society, for the country
On 26th January, we should collectively endeavour to honour the statues of such great men, to clean them, to clean the premises and all these things should be easily done by the people, by the citizens.
Friends, Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
You must have got the opportunity to go.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, trade and employment must have started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Every nook and corner of the world has received news of natural calamities and reports of natural calamities that have never been heard or thoughtless.
People are also experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
Many people have died.
My thoughts are with all those families in this hour of grief.
The state governments are fully engaged in relief operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Recently, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But whenever we want a lot of trouble, we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity was a part of the agriculture sector as it was confined to the highest natural calamity i. e.
Today its form has changed.
At every level, it has become imperative for us to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small and big institution has to work for capacity building in a very scientific manner.
After the Nepal earthquake, I spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
And I had suggested to them that SAARC countries should come together to make a joint statement for the prevention of disasters.
I am glad that a Tabletok Exercise Is and Best Practices seminar and workshop of SAARC countries have been concluded in Delhi.
There was a good beginning.
I have received a phone call from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
(He speaks from Jalandhar, Punjab District.
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people.
I am delighted to hear your message.
Moreover, you are well aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concerns are true but this is not the case with Punjab Haryana alone.
This is our habit throughout India and traditionally we are moving forward on the path of burning the remains of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
The first step is to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of crops are also very valuable.
It is a biological fertilizer in itself.
We wade it.
Moreover, if a small piece of it is made then it becomes a dry fruit for the animals.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the land gets burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Imagine for a moment that our bones are strong, our hearts are strong, kidneys are good, everything is good, but what will happen if the upper skin of the body is burnt
Heart cannot survive even if it continues.
Our upper layer burns, which pushes our yield to death.
And therefore, we should make a positive effort.
Once again the thumb is buried in the ground, it becomes a surety.
Or if some water is poured into a ditch by pouring potatoes into a ditch then it becomes an excellent organic fertilizer.
Animals are not only used for their food but they also save our land but also if they put the fertilizer produced in the ground, it will double the benefits.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who had cultivated bananas.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier when he used to do banana cultivation and when the banana crop was over, he used to spend Rs. 5,000, 10,000, fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people carrying it they used to carry tractors and bakers.
However, some farmers proved that they had made six-six-eight inch pieces of this mattress and plunged them into the ground.
The water in that tank keeps the crop alive.
My dear countrymen, on the next three Decembers, the entire world will remember the International Day of Persons with DCabilities.
Last time, Mann Ki Baat had discussed my contributions.
The Helpline for the Organisation was also discussed.
On November 2, 2018, Indian Organisation was considered as DoNER Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and many well-known people joined the film.
Partnership can save valuable lives.
When one organ goes from body to body then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense, the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be given as much as possible.
I had earlier said that it is being celebrated on 3rd December as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally challenged people also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes they get pain when they get fun.
Sometimes a feeling of compassion and kindness is expressed.
But if we change our vision and change our vision, these people can inspire us to live.
You can inspire you to do something.
We start crying even when there is a small problem.
Then I remember that my problem is very small, how does it manage
And that is why all these are a source of inspiration for us.
His philosophy is commendable for converting the ways and hurdles of his life into capability.
Javed Ahmad, I want to talk to him today.
40-42 years old.
In 1966, Javed Ahmed was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir.
The ability to stand on his feet went on forever but Javed Ahmad did not give up.
Even the wounds of terrorism cannot defeat them.
Body does not support but she has been immersed in the study of children for twenty years.
How to improve infrastructure for physically challenged people
How to develop facilities for handicappedness in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also altered his studies in that direction.
He received Master Degree in social work and as a social worker, he is making a silent revolution by becoming an enlightened citizen of the disabled.
Is the life of Javed not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmad and his penance and dedication on December 3.
I may be talking about Javed in the absence of time but the lamps of such inspiration are flourishing in every corner of India.
New lights of life are spreading, they are showing ways.
On 3rd December there is an opportunity to draw inspiration from all such people by remembering them.
Whether it is the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the Dalits, the oppressed, the deprived and the deprived sections of the society, the government is constantly working with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes someone gets a bad feeling from someone's government.
And this very bad experience changes our perspective of looking at the government system forever.
Sometimes we dont even know because we are so simple that we dont know that any government system, any government servant is doing this thing.
ASHA Workers in our country, which is a network across the country.
We have never heard of ASHA workers among the people of India, nor have you heard of them.
But when I became the worlds most renowned family Entrepreneur of Bill Gates Foundation, his success has become a phenomenon.
In the past, we had jointly embraced Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
He works very socially in India.
Whatever he earns, whatever he earns, he has been working for the welfare of the poor.
In the last few days, the Government of Odisha had specially honoured ASHA Worker on his Independence Day.
They should be treated on the basis of the preliminary systems they have learnt.
Emphasis should be laid on using insecticides every household.
As our children sleep well and take care of them, ASHA worker Jamuna Mani Singh is working with dedication to protect the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he fought against Malaria and prepared to compete with the entire village.
How many jamunamanis would be there if they had come.
How many lakhs of people will be around us
We will look at them with some respect.
Such people become so impossible for our country.
How big is the happiness and grief of the society
I salute all such ASHA workers through jamunani.
An e-book in the context of the inspiring events of Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of MPs and healthcare sector.
I urge you to look at it.
See, not only this, but also show others.
Read it and you may feel like adding such things.
So you need Mygov.
in.
Such things do not come very quickly in our minds but they are the only ones that can come true for the society.
Positive potential is the largest energy.
You should also share good events.
You can become a social teacher in the true sense.
The temperature of the earth should not rise anymore.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also a concern.
And this is the first way to save the temperature.
14th December is National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are underway from the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
Once I had said that on the full moon night, cane lights should be darkened and bathed in full moonlight for hours.
It should feel the light of the moon.
A friend sent me a link to see and when I got the opportunity to see it, I felt like telling you this thing.
In Kanpur, a woman named Nurjahan does not seem to have had the privilege of studying more on TV.
But they are doing something that perhaps no one would have thought of.
He is working with solar energy to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He has created a committee of women and has set up a plant for solar energy driven funnels.
And they pay the rent of 100 rupees per month.
People take funns in the evening and come back in the morning and give it again for charging.
I have heard that people from 500 households come here.
Now see what the world's largest people will do for climate change, but a wonderful saying is inspiring everyone.
And the meaning of Noorjahan is to publish the world.
He is spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nur Jahan and JTT because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the Prime Minister how these MUDRA banks are helped by adventurers like us.
Mudra promotes business enterprises.
Mudra generates income opportunities.
And Mudra empowers in the true sense.
This Mudra Yojana is going on to help the small adventurers.
However, the pace at which I want to go, that pace is yet to come.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of these 66 lakh women, about 24 lakh are women.
And most of the SCs, STs and OBCs who are working hard to run their family with dignity.
Abhishek has spoken of his own enthusiasm.
There are many news reports coming to me.
Someone has just told me that there is a Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he received a loan of Rs. 8.
And he started trading in Suez Dress Sufi.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhata Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle has done so.
They have brought a tank and they have been working and I have been told that in such a short span of time they have given two lakh rupees to the bank.
This is the purpose under our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to raise money from more interest.
And because of the earlier interest and other reasons, due to other reasons, the amount of money that was spent was now coming into their hands, they started saving about one thousand rupees per month.
And a good business of his family has also started increasing.
However, I would like that there should be more propaganda of the scheme.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help the smallest of the people.
In fact, the economy of the country is run by these people.
Only those who do small things are economically impossible for the country.
We also want to insist on it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things in which there should be sustained awareness in society.
What should be the framework of the program
What should be logo
How to increase public participation
I had asked for all these suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are being received.
But I still expect more suggestions.
I expect a lot of chowks.
And I have been told that the participants will have to get certificates.
Some big prizes have been announced.
You should also run your creative mind.
How can Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra of Unity Integration a mantra to connect this mantra with Ek Bharat
Whether it is a public or a dignified person or a living person, whether it is easy to connect with everyone or not, what should the government do
What does society do
What does civil society do
There can be many things.
I am sure your suggestions will be used.
My dear brothers and sisters, Winter has arrived.
I would urge you to use this good weather for a while to keep the body healthy.
And we should create an environment in the family, it should be a festival for the family, it should be done for an hour together.
See how consciousness comes and how much body supports the whole day.
So if there is a good weather then a good habit can also be developed.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind...
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
Once again I am fortunate to join you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to commemorate the fifth day match in Mumbai.
This series has been named as the Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre in Akashwani.
I would like that if such cyclones across the country pay attention to such vigilant and active people in their respective areas then our aim of running the country with public participation will get a new strength.
And that is why I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the colleagues of the Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School, Chittor have written a letter to me in Kerala.
The letter is special in many ways.
First of all, these girls have painted a picture of Mother India with their thumbs.
I have sent a picture of the map of India.
At first, I was very surprised to know why he made the map of India with the help of his thumb.
But when I read his letter, I came to know what a great reflection he had delivered.
These are the girls who have not only made efforts to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is running a public awareness campaign for participants.
He has also staged drama at various places to understand the contributions of the people.
Organ donation becomes a attitude and activity.
These girls have written to me in a letter to you all to appeal to the people about your contribution in Mann Ki Baat.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have received a lot of messages on phone calls.
Debesh ji of Delhi has given me a similar message.
The ambitious goal of donating one donor by every ten lakh people is a very productive step taken by the government.
I feel this thing is very important.
More than 2. 5 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 1. 25 billion people, we can achieve only five thousand transplants.
Every year one lakh eyesight is required.
And we can reach only twenty five thousand.
We can only give one in front of the need for four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the penetration and speed it up.
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of Organ donation.
Several social institutions and several voluntary organizations have been working very well in this direction.
National Organisation and Teacher Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to promote organ transplant transplantation.
A round-the-clock helpline 1800 1140 services are also available.
And we have been told there that Tyaktein Bhujeetha.
This Takteen Bhujeetha mantra describes the joy of sacrifice.
A few days ago, we had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
We must fulfil the spirit of Tyktein Bhujeetha and give a boost to this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Recently we have celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days we will also celebrate Diwali.
Id is also celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi.
India-Africa Forensic Summit is being held in New Delhi, the capital of India from 26th to 2nd October, 2018.
This is the first time that such a large scale event is being organised on Indias soil.
Choppon African countries and Union leaders have been invited.
Outside Africa, one of the largest conferences of African countries is being held.
India-Africa relations are deep.
The population of African countries is as much as that of India.
And if we both meet, we are the third largest population of the world.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago this was the same hunger.
Later these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
It is our good fortune in natural resources.
And nearly 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural and political ties.
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of the most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India in Human Resource Development, Capacity Building.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have studied in India.
So how close we are
And in that sense, this Summit is very important.
Normally, when the Summit comes, heads from different countries meet.
Similarly, the Summit is scheduled to be attended by Heads of States.
But it is our endeavor that people should also be included in it.
Approximately six hundred schools participated in it.
It also included schools outside India and India.
And thousands of school children have written about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition titled 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is going on from Porbandar to the Northern states, on the 2nd October.
Millions of school children witnessed the exhibition.
The people of the village witnessed how Mahatma Gandhi had played a major role in Africa and India's relations. What was the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's archaeology on both the landscapes
Children from schools in our small places are also very brilliant in their vision and their deep thoughts are visible in them.
In fact, the summit is of India-Africa, but we can clearly see the opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in the competition, over 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on 15th August, I had made a proposal on the MPAGY.
Thereafter, many of the Parliamentarian friends have done this work.
He was very impressed.
A workshop was held in Bhopal last month.
Where this ideal village is being built, the Sarpanch, the Collector, the Parliamentarians, the Government of India, the State Government, all of them together discussed the issue of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
A lot of innovative things were noticed and very enthusiastic things came to light.
I would like to bring some of these things to your attention.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a big region, a tribal area.
He chose to make Parsi Gram Panchayat an ideal village in Kunti district of Jharkhand.
It was also difficult for government employees to go there.
I congratulate Honble Member of Parliament, Shriman Karia Mundaji.
And in a way, the school offers education for children in the morning and teaches children in the evening.
And these children taught about five hundred and fifty illiterates.
We see that there is no budgetary system, no circular system, no special system in the society, but what a big change can be brought about by willingness through Gram Panchayats.
This village is well known for sugarcane production and kurtaya jaggery in the state.
Smt. Ruwala ji started the Kurtaya Galle Sherdi festival in this village on 11th March.
People of old public life also came here.
The government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was organized to increase the sale of sugarcane products.
How the village can be made a hub of economic activity, how sand can be sold in the village itself.
Ruwala ji is truly a complimentary officer for his efforts to build a self-reliant village along with an ideal village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and not a matter of cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent a telephone message to me: We clean our homes every year to prepare for Diwali.
On this Diwali, let us make the outside environment clean along with our homes and keep it clean even after Diwali.
He pointed to the correctness.
My dear countrymen, I want to remind you that last year, after Diwali festivals, our country, especially the media, had launched a massive drive. And whenever there was a scarcity of firecrackers, they said that this is not the same.
All the media had launched a campaign of awareness.
And the result was that immediately after Diwali a clean drive was launched.
So, Savita ji, it is true that the more we worry before the festival, the more we should do after the festival.
It should be done in every public program.
And today I would particularly like to congratulate the entire media world of India.
On 2nd October, I was fortunate to be here on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and participate in the SafaiGiri Sammelan organised by India Today Group on the occasion of one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He gave away the Clean India Awards and I was also seeing how many activities are going on.
For this, people themselves are working like the One Light One Mission.
What are the places that have been kept so clean in our country
All these things came to light and I conveyed my heartfelt gratitude to them for their commendable work at that time.
Through e-TV, he has been promoting sanitation work for the last one year.
He has added 51 lakh children of about 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra-Telangana.
Whether it is a public place, a station, a religious place, a hospital or a garden, a massive cleanliness drive has been launched in many places.
Now these reports themselves show the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
The Mission Clean India is the hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of printing presses, I cannot take everyone's name due to lack of time, but everyone has started this campaign.
And that is why according to the suggestions given by Savita Raiji, today the entire country is considering this thing as its own.
From Meghalaya, our Governor has written a letter to His Excellency Shanmugnath.
And through that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years, this village has faced a challenge of cleanliness, and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cause of cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he was awarded the Swachh Village of Asia.
I am glad to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in the far-flung North-East of our country which has been in the field of sanitation for years.
This has become the nature of the citizens there and it has become a culture of the village.
This is what gives confidence to all of us that our country will be clean.
And when we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we can proudly say that lice have freed our mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that there are some things where corruption has taken place.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know how difficult it is to bear the burden of anybody's recommendations.
I have never heard of a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological phenomena that surrounds a person in a two-minute interview.
And I had announced this idea that why should we not abolish the Interview tradition for small jobs
My dear young friends, today I am proud to say that the government has completed all the procedures and now the interviews will not be taken on non-gazetted posts of Group D Group C and Group B.
The Rules shall come into force from 1st January, 2016.
We will not put any hurdles in the process that is underway, but it will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we have announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered as a medium of economic security.
The crisp time key is considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will pay you interest on it, just as you deposit your money and get interest, you get interest on it.
Earlier we used to keep the gold in the locality and we had to pay the local rent.
Now I will put the gold in the bank and the bank will give you the money in the form of interest.
Can't the patriots now become the wealth of gold
Whether the dead of gold can change from money to life force or not
We have to do the same thing, please join me.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Its security and interest are two benefits.
Take certain advantages.
There is another scheme Sovereign Gold Bond in which you do not have a gold bond in your hands but there is a paper.
However, the price of this paper is as much as one gold, on the day you return this paper, the same amount of gold will be paid back to you.
So we are launching these schemes.
Because of this, we will no longer have to buy gold.
So, I will definitely present this guaranteed security scheme to the countrymen next week.
I am glad to say that we are bringing a gold coin with Ashok Chakra.
It has been almost 70 years since our independence but till now we have been using foreign gold or gold boolean bars.
Why should not the indigenous market of our country be there
Therefore, in the next week and in the next week, Indian gold coins comprising five grams and ten grams of Ashoka cycle are being started.
Besides, a 20 gram gold bullen will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new innovation in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October marks the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is remembered as a map of Ek Bharat.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
Iron Man has shown his ability.
We will pay our homage to Sardar Saheb but his dream of uniting India was what he had geographically demonstrated. But this mantra of unity should continue to be a medium of our thinking, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Our country is full of several sects, sects, dialects, castes, dresses and diversity and this is the reason for our diversity.
Had it not been a diversity, perhaps we would have taken pride in the splendour that we would not have taken.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, Run for Unity programmes are being organised across the country on 31st October.
I have heard that this time too, it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the race for unity.
The race for unity is in the true sense of development.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race of unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Proceed with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting the United Kingdom on the second day of Diwali.
I am very excited about my visit to the UK this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such classes of society, be it Dalits, tribals or backward classes, their bright children who go to study abroad.
I am confident that this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for him when our children of India will study in Britain.
And that is why I am saying that I am particularly thrilled about my visit to Britain.
And you can imagine the kind of joy the people like me if that building is going to be constructed by 1. 25 billion Indians, with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
I will also get another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Basweshwar.
The work that Lord Basweshwar had done for democracy and women empowerment several years ago is truly a studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Basweshwar to the household of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India used to think and think centuries ago.
You know, whenever such incidents are connected, the hearts of our countrymen get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you all are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, there are discussions on the skies of your letters.
Government officials are being called upon and discussed.
Some people write about their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
A good relationship has been created between us.
Last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
There has been a fundamental idea in my life and because of this I have had immense faith in the power of the people. However, I can tell from what Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what has been explained, what has been understood and what has been experienced by me that peoples power is more than what we think.
Our ancestors used to say that Janardan is a part of God.
I can say with my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is a lot of power in the thoughts of our ancestors, it is very grave because I have realized that I used to ask for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and I could talk about only two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to inform me when they were active.
Yes, these lakhs of letters have also given me a big message.
Different departments of the government analyzed the public's letters and what is the matter of policy, what is the personal question, what is it that is not in the government's mind
Who would have thought that the source of these information would be Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that the selfie with the doctor and the whole world were surprised.
Perhaps, in all the countries of the world, what was the honor of millions of selfie with the doctor and the daughter
And when he used to do selfie with a doctor, he not only encouraged his daughter but also made a commitment within himself.
Even when people looked at it, they felt that the neglect of the daughters would be neglected now.
It was a silent revolution.
Keeping Indias tourism in mind, I had told the same citizens that if you go to Incredible India, if there is a good picture then I will see it.
The tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government has never thought that we have such a beautiful legacy.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is there no demand of time now for Khadi for fashion
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the last one year, the sale of Khadi has almost doubled.
On a TV channel, I had seen that a retired teacher was standing on a widow's line to lay down the subsidy.
It is difficult for the common man to leave the subsidy for the middle class, lower middle class, but such people have left.
Is not this a silent revolution
Is not this the vision of people power
Governments must also learn that the work done in our government offices is a powerful, energetic and determined society outside Umbara.
We made every small thing ourselves and tried to connect ourselves for the betterment of the country.
What can be a bigger satisfaction than this .
In Mann Ki Baat this time I thought of doing a new experiment.
I prayed to the citizens of the country to telephonize your questions and suggestions.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a very pleasant experience.
People of all ages have given a message.
I liked to hear some messages myself and I felt good.
My team is working on the rest of the work.
You may have taken a minute or two minutes but for me your phone call, your message is very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But one thing was astonishing for me and it was a pleasure.
However, it seems as if there is negativeness and negativeness all around.
But my experience was different.
These five thousand people had to say their own words.
However, I am surprised to know that all these things were just like being in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, indicative, creative.
People have said more than 70 of the remaining energy-filling and enjoyable things.
They must have listened to the radio.
I came to know about the importance of radio for the blind.
I have seen a new Ayam and have said such good things that these people and the government are sufficient to make them sensitive.
I have received a message from Pawan Acharya from Alwar Rajasthan.
Listen to what they want to say - "My name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
Pawan, I am confident that like the wind, your feelings will certainly reach every corner of India.
We have suggested that soil should not be valued and soil can be priceless.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the army personnel.
Whether it is our navy, the land, the air force, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy
The war in 1965, completed 50 years with Pakistan.
On this occasion, a gallantry exhibition has been set up near the India Gate in Delhi.
From the point of view of history we can learn a lot and if we look at them for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no bigger inspiration than this for serving the motherland.
Whether it is the Hajipir, the real Northern, the Chamindaani or the Hajipir, the vision of victory is thrilling and our soldiers are proud of it.
I had to meet these brave families too. Those who took part in the war are now in the Northern Region of their lives.
If you want to make history, it is important to understand history deeply.
I came back in two and a half hours but it will take you three-four hours.
Look at the power of democracy, a small child has ordered the elderly but the child has forgotten to mention his name in a hurry.
We should also make the nature of cleanliness and make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from the message of this child.
I have to hear a lot too.
I see that the Parliament of the country is also discussing about the cleanliness of India.
And on the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the one hand the child of this country talk about cleanliness - what could be the good fortune of a big country
The movement that is going on - the atmosphere of hatred towards filth - the awareness about cleanliness - will also empower and enable governments to work.
And in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once he had said that if I had to choose one of the two things for freedom and cleanliness, I would like to choose cleanliness first. After independence, even cleanliness was more important than independence for Gandhi.
From Delhi, Gulshan Arora ji has sent a message to May Gov.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men are always a source of inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to evaluate the ideals of our great men.
If you take out any date, you will find the name of a great man out of the orientation of history.
In the days to come, let us remember all these great men, let us convey the message of their lives to every household and let us also try to learn something from them.
I would like to especially urge you once again for 2nd October.
2 October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothing, every kind of fabric, every kind of thing but it should also have a place for Khadi.
Once again I said that Khadi is freed from 2nd October to 1 month.
We should take advantage of this.
And along with Khadi handlooms should also be given equal importance.
And that is why in this Diwali, we must give Khadi a place in our homes and place it on our body.
And we have doubled the sales in the past.
How many poor people have benefited
You people have done the work that the government cannot do with the publication of billions of rupees.
This is the strength of the people and that is why I once again urge you for this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a lot of joy in this thing.
I feel like you should also get some taste for this joy.
I had gone to Kolkata in the month of May and had come to meet the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
His brother Chandra Bose organised everything.
For a long time, I had got the opportunity to spend a happy evening with the family members of Subhas Babu.
Can you imagine how much happiness would be for me
Perhaps for the first time in his life, there might have been an occasion for all to go to the prime minister's residence.
But more than that, it is a matter of happiness for me that I have never had the privilege of receiving such hospitality at the Prime Ministers residence in October.
More than 50 people of Subhas Babu and the entire family live in different countries, all people are coming specially.
I received a message from Bhargavi Kanda and listening to his voice, I felt that he felt like a leader himself and perhaps he would become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to make a statement to the elder Prime Minister that you should create awareness among the younger generation about water registration so that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation is increased and the government is selecting and running important cooperation of the younger generation in the future.
Every voter in the democracy has the privilege of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we saw that our Election Commission was working as a controller only but in the last few years there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just a regulator but a facilitator, it has become a voter friend and it has become a voter friend in all its ideas and programmes.
The electoral roll should continue to be upgraded and we should also keep examining.
I am telling you during the elections that water has been supplied after the first polls.
Everyone should do such a sacred thing.
On the ultimate day, I visited Kashi.
Once I got a seventh grade student named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh standard in Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is very intelligent.
But at such a young age, I saw his interest in physics research.
What kind of sensitivities should be there in robots, what kind of things he was talking about, it was awesome brother.
There should be continuous questions in the mind of the child .
How to do
When
This child should ask his mind.
Similarly, I had to meet a very small child.
He is nine years old.
This daughter of Sadabrij Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the entire song that she had sacrificed is her heart.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him he used to say Shloka, he used to interpret it in English and used to define it in Hindi.
Read only the Gita or the other thing .
If we take history, we keep it in the evening.
We all wonder how the entire family is blessed with such talent
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes some children feel celebrity but there was nothing like that in Sonam.
Besides what you see on TV, you read in newspapers, we do a lot of things and sometimes enjoy such things.
In the same way, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people bring me a lot of work in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
Once in a month, I have to make such a mistake, I have to adjust so much time.
Sometimes my colleagues in the skywalk have to wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestions.
Now it is just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how Subhas Babu used the radio
He started his radio from Germany and continued to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He started the Azad Hind Radio from a weekly News bulletin.
He used to run this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu.
It has been a year since I talked about Mann Ki Baat on the sky.
I say that I am also yours and this is my satisfaction.
We will again meet for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending the suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution is valuable to me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you for Mann Ki Baat.
People in far flung areas are celebrating Onam and yesterday the entire nation celebrated Raksha Bandhan's holy festival.
In keeping with the social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, everyone has accepted these schemes in a big way.
I had made a small request that we should give this security scheme to our sisters on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have got the first information that about 11 crore families have joined this scheme since its inception.
Moreover, I have been told that almost half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
A year ago, since I was talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in a big way.
Why would the work that has not happened for sixty years be done in such a short span of time
I also saw the Amir of the poor
The accounts were to be opened with zero balance.
But the poor saved and deposited twenty two thousand crore rupees.
Youngsters have got employment.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, one lakh thirty one thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poorest of the poor.
Opening of accounts is not about to stop.
And now thousands of people have become officers of overdraft under the Jan Dhan Yojana and they have taken it
And there was a belief that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and now it is your duty to keep it alive.
All of us should have an active account.
I am sure you will do that.
Over the last few days, the incidents of Gujarat, the drums of violence, made the entire country restless.
But in a very short span of time all my enlightened citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
The situation prevailed and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this is the right path.
And we have to walk on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I have got the opportunity to hear the kind of things that I have experienced in a way that music is playing.
I felt very good.
It is perhaps the most important thing in the world to realize the true nature of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and liberality will take this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that we may believe in any community but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya.
First Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
I will have the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to tell you a special mention of Mann Ki Baat.
I have already mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
He must have listened to me in the Parliament, heard me in public meetings, listened to me in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mindset is open on the issue of disputes regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the welfare of farmers and I have been reiterating that.
However, today I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the issue of reforms in the Land Acquisition Act has come through the states and it has been urgent that if we want to provide water to the villages, if we want to provide water to the poor farmers then we will have to take a pillar to provide electricity to the fields, if we have to build a road for the village, if we have to make arrangements for the employment of the poor youth of the village then we will have to leave the laws in the limbo.
And then there was a proposal for amendment.
But I saw that the danger was spread so much that the farmers were so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My farmer should not be misguided nor should he be afraid.
And I dont want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears the farmers and misleads the farmers.
We presented an Ordinance.
Ordinance is being completed tomorrow on the 3rd of August.
And I have decided that it should be abolished.
It means that the situation that preceded my government was re-established.
But one work was incomplete.
And that is why we had brought them in the Ordinance but due to these disputes this issue was also wrong.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not just a slogan but it is our mantra.
Welfare of Villages, Poor Farmers
And that is why on 15th August I had said that not only the agriculture department but also the welfare department will be created.
And when it comes to the battle of 165, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural for us to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan- Jai Kisan.
It is also very natural to remember all those martyrs who have maintained the tri-color flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 War.
And I am glad that India is doing a very good job in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are actually doing a great job.
Now we have the opportunity to take these researches to the masses .
How to convert principles into appliances
How to connect labels with land
We have to take it forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an extremely inspiring experience for me.
And when I had reiterated in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and many possibilities.
I get a lot of letters from citizens.
He has written about Skill Development.
Sriman Prakash Tripathi from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu has stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I have also told my young friends one thing.
I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August that why interview for lower level jobs
And when an Interview call comes, where will every poor family, widowed mother get employment
Poor people dont have to run for employment.
There should be no exploitation, no corruption.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially maternal and infant mortality reduction, the call-to-action was jointly deliberated upon by twenty-four countries of the world.
This is for the first time in any other country outside the USA.
However, the improvement has gone up.
India is getting praised at the international level, yet this figure is not small.
Just as we got rid of the police, we also got rid of the tetanus in the deaths of mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous but it is very easy to save it.
And the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about is directly related to it.
We need advertising on TV.
There is widespread public education in this regard, but we do not care.
I would urge you all to say that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Concentration on water, satisfaction about sanitation, it is not a fact that it becomes a cause of death.
Free Dengue testing facilities are available at around 500 square centres across the country.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, in a way, there is a festival in our country from Rakshabandhan to Diwali.
Why should not every festival of ours be connected with cleanliness
You see, Sanskrit will become that nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, however, has a feeling of serving the tribals of India in his heart.
Both of these brothers have enhanced India's pride.
These two brothers won the race this year.
India's respect has increased.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am extremely delighted to note that their entire mission is being carried out by Team India - Vision for Tribals with the intention of saddling them.
See, what kind of efforts everybody is making to take the country forward
When we hear such incidents, the chest blossoms.
Sometimes because of perception, we commit grave injustice to our elders.
My experience with regard to youngsters is different.
Sometimes we also learn a lot when we talk to the youngsters.
I have met many youngsters who say, "Brothers, I have taken a pledge in life that "Sand on Cycle".
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day a week.
Today I would especially like to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand, divine, inspiring memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
When the Indians travelling across the world will go to London, the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar which will now be constructed by the Maharashtra government will be an inspiration for us.
I express my heartfelt condolences to the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
After a long gap, once again, we are launching Mann Ki Baat amongst you, Mann Ki Baat among the people, talk of the people, talk of the people and of the people.
Sitting in the midst of him, he used to listen, repeat and sometimes our thoughts became an inspiration for us.
You can imagine how the time has passed.
Perhaps this was not a lifeless programme.
I used to miss something every moment and when I speak Mann Ki Baat, I may be saying that the words are mine, the voices are mine but the story is yours, the story is yours, the strength is yours, the valour is yours.
I used to use my words, my rhetoric and that is why I was missing you and not the programme.
It was an empty feeling.
But this Sunday was awaiting a lot.
Well, the opportunity has come to an end.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, Minimum, Little, Social, Life, which becomes a cause of change.
In a way, this sequence gives rise to a new emotion and in a way supports the spirit of New India.
I feel a sense of belongingness.
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the world.
This is my journey from Aham to Um.
For me, my silent interaction with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions in the race for elections, why I was going to Kedarnath.
Most people have derived political meaning from it.
For me, this was the opportunity to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I will discuss it sometimes.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, I have been feeling relentlessly in your efforts to strengthen one positive thing.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are very different from the regular government functions.
Sometimes, sometimes the work of pushing forward my thought process is done by you people.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is showing disagreements with dirt but he also predicts the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment then he does not feel the pain but at the same time he also tells us the experiments he has seen and also portrays the imaginations that he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I am feeling a glimpse of how socially behavioural problems can be solved.
Mann Ki Baat is like a blessing for the country and the society.
It shows us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent in our countrymen.
The need is to incorporate that strength and talent, to provide opportunities and to activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also says that all the 130 crore countrymen want to connect with the country's development with strength and proactiveness. And I would like to say this thing from the necessity that I have received such a letter in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls are received, but the level of complaints is very low and if someone has asked for something, I have not noticed the same thing in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how much pleasure my heart might be, how much energy I might be getting.
You have left me alone and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, let us move forward the sequence of Mann Ki Baat.
When there was a crisis in the country, the opposition was not confined to the political sphere, it was not confined to the politicians, it was not confined to the jails.
There was an anger in the hearts of the people.
There was a thirst for lost democracy.
One doesnt know what is hungry during day and night when one eats food, just like one knows what is the pleasure of the rights of democracy in normal life when one snatches away democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country felt that something had been snatched away.
Perhaps in a country of the world, every person in the country has voted for democracy instead of fulfilling his rights and necessities.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a massive election campaign was completed in our country, from Amir to Poor, everybody was eager to felicitate the future of our country with happiness.
Whenever anything is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing facts are also ignored.
These numbers may seem very common to us but if I say that in terms of the world, if we leave a China then more than one country in the world voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2017 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total number of Europeans.
This reflects the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The 2017 Lok Sabha elections were the worlds largest democratic elections in history.
You can imagine how large the need for resources and manpower must have been created to complete this kind of election.
Elections of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff could be made possible by day and night labour.
In order to successfully fulfil this magnificent magnificence of democracy, about 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces took responsibility, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laboured.
As a result of hard work of these people, more votes were cast than last time.
More than 10 lakh Polling Stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big theme is for the polls in the country.
All this was done so as to ensure that no voter is deprived of his vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one female polling station was set up.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two-two days to reach there. This is the true honour of democracy.
The world's highest polling station is also located in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is one more fact of pride in this election.
Perhaps this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm just like men.
The percentage of women and men's voting in this election was almost identical.
One more enthusiastic fact is that today there are seventy-eight women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the electoral process and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth that "Book not Book" was my request that we can give books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books at many places.
Someone recently gave me a book called Premchand Ki Popular Story and I felt very good.
Though I could not get much time but during the tour I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His words, expressing human sensibilities in simple, simple language touched my heart.
Their interaction covers the whole of India.
When I was reading his stories of intoxication, my mind went on its own to the economic contradictions in the society.
I was reminded of the days of my youth how these topics were being discussed overnight.
It is learnt from the legacy of the landlords son Goddess and the heroes of the poor family that when you are not careful then the impact of a bad world can never be known.
The second word that touched my heart was 'Idgah'.
A child's sensitivity, a pure love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling in such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches his grandfather with a chapio from the fair, the human empathy reaches its peak.
In this interaction, a life-threatening picture of the problems faced by the poor farmers was seen.
Though its crops have been destroyed, the small farmers are so pleased that they will not have to sleep in the fields in extreme cold.
Though this is about a century ago, its relevance still remains the same.
After reading this, I felt a different kind of feeling.
When it comes to reading, I used to read about Kerala's Akshaya Library in some media.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village located in the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of primary school here, P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here tied in potla and placed on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
The 'Vanche Gujarat' campaign in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Millions of people of every age participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would urge you to take some time out and place books in your daily routine.
You will actually be very enjoyable and write on Narendra Modi App about all the books that you read so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issue which is a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, the Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf, many people have written to me about the water related challenges.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
In the Rig Veda Aap: Suktam, it is said about water, . . . . water is the source of life energy.
Your grace keeps on showering your blessings on us like a mother.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received during the rainy season is saved in our country.
Only 8.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will also solve this problem with the participation of the people, with the power of the people and with the capabilities, cooperation and determination of 1.
Keeping in view the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed in the country.
This will speedily take decisions on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote letters to Sarpanches from across the country, to the Gram Pradhans.
I wrote to the Gram Pradhans that to save water, to store water, to save rain water, to hold a meeting of the Gram Sabha, to discuss with the villagers.
I am glad that he showed great enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People took a pledge to collect one drop of water in the village.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
On behalf of me, I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, to all the Sarpanches for their activity.
There are several sarpanches across the country that have accelerated the seed of water conservation.
In a way, this has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now competing for the construction of a Jal Mandir in their villages.
As I said, collective efforts can have many positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for exit of water crisis across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But everyones goal is one and that is water conservation.
Trainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the construction of a tank in Themaipalli, Telangana.
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about those women from Garhwal who have been doing a very good job at the Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that several such efforts have been made and when we work together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will connect, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have been making three requests to the countrymen.
My first appeal is - just as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement, let us also start a mass movement for water conservation.
We all resolve to save every drop of water together. And I believe that water is the Prasad of Parameswar, water is the form of mercury.
Earlier it was said that iron becomes gold from the touch of mercury.
I say that water is mercury and through mercury, water touch creates a new life.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell about the problems related to water in it, also propagate ways to save water.
I specially urge the stakeholders of different sectors to lead innovative camps for water conservation.
Whether it is in the field of film industry, in the field of sports, media friends, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, storytelling people, every person should lead this movement in his own way.
It connects society, society, society and society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My second request is that many traditional methods are being used in our country for water conservation for centuries.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit the place of birth of Porbandar and venerable Bapu then there is another house behind the house of venerable Bapu, where there is a water tank of 200 years old and there is water and there is a provision to stop rain water then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes, that water should be observed.
There will be many such experiments everywhere.
Come, let us inspire people for water conservation by making a list of more and more methods.

My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude for one thing and also express my gratitude to the people of the world.
Once again on 21st June, on the occasion of Yoga Day, three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for the Holistic Health Care.
In every corner of the world, if a lover of Yoga welcomes it as soon as the sun rises, then it is the entire journey till the sun rises.
Perhaps there will be a place where there is no human being or Yoga is not associated with Yoga.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from the Air Force to the Aircraft Carriers, from the AC gyms to the smoking desert, from villages to cities, wherever possible, Yoga has not only been done in every such place but it has also been collectively celebrated.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and common citizens of many countries of the world have shown me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive people are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the promotion of Yoga is a great work of social service.
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me to announce Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution towards the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019.
This award has been given to those organisations from all over the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly in the promotion of Yoga.
Take the example of 'Japan Yoga Niketan' which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Several institutes and training courses of Japan Yoga Niketan are either conducted by MSMEs or by MSMEs.
Take the name Antonietta Rozzzi, who started the 'Surva Yoga International' and promoted Yoga throughout Europe.
This is an inspiring example in itself.
If this is a subject related to Yoga, can Indians remain behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger were also honoured and dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also felicitated and set up a White Mission and Lukulish Yoga University.
Honouring the massive celebrations of Yoga and the honour of those who have delivered the message of Yoga has made this Yoga Day special.
It is a very big journey for me to connect with your thoughts, Mann Ki Baat.
Let us keep meeting, let us keep on talking.
Keep listening to your feelings, remaining true and understanding.
Sometimes we try to live those feelings.
May your blessings be with you.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us together enjoy Mann Ki Baat and fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India had lost her blessings.
These brave heroes have sacrificed their lives for the protection of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Our brave sons had united day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the braves in the Pulwama terror attack, the people and people of the entire country are shocked and angry.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have emerged.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who have saved their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to tackle the challenges faced by the country by forgetting the differences between casteism, communalism, regionalism and all others so that our actions against terrorism become even stronger than ever before.
Our Armed Forces have been displaying unique valour and valour since time immemorial.
Once upon a time, he has demonstrated unprecedented potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also been given answers in their language.
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has pledged to destroy the integration of terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring stories of his family members have been strengthened by the media.
Ramniranji, the father of the martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all in this hour of grief.
He said that he will send his second daughter to fight against the enemy, and if necessary, he will fight himself.
The entire country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meenaji, the wife of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
They have pledged to enroll each other in the CRPF.
When the body of Martyr Vijay Soren reached Gumla in Jharkhand via Triranga, his Masum Dikra had said that I too would join the footsteps.
The spirit of this month expresses the feeling of a single child across India.
Such feelings are being seen in the homes of our heroic martyrs.
I appeal to the younger generation to try to understand and understand the spirit and sentiment shown by these families.
We do not have to go towards the ancient event of history to know what is sacrifice and penance .
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty ji of Udupi Karnataka expressed his happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was surprised and painful that there was no national war memorial in India.
It is a memorial where the heroic legends of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation can be kept alive.
I decided that such a memorial should definitely be there in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on the 25th of February, we will dedicate this National Army Memorial to our Armed Forces.
The country will make such a small effort to repay its debt.
A new memorial has been built just close to the heart of Delhi or the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti have come.
I am confident that we will be able to visit this National Army Memorial at any shrine for our countrymen.
This is a symbol of national gratitude towards the supreme sacrifice made after Independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the indomitable courage of our armed forces.
The martyrdom of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the soldiers.
The second is the Circle of Veerta Cycle, which shows the courage and valour of the soldiers.
Thereafter, there is a cycle of sacrifice.
This circle shows the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters.
After that the guardian cycle demonstrates security.
This circle contains dense trees.
The identity of the National Army Memorial will emerge as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country for studying their gratitude, and it is a matter of those who sacrificed their lives.
Those who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
In the month of October last year, I had got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to those men and women police personnel who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments of yours keep getting me read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comments, I remembered a very interesting copies of Atish Mukherjee ji.
He writes that when the British captured Birsa Munda on 3rd March, 2009, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
He further writes that both these personalities have come from an entirely different family background, which enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is apt to salute the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brought laurels for not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if we need an inspiring personality to guide our youth then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When he was sleeping, the British hid and grabbed him very carefully.
Do you know why the British took the support of such draconian actions
Because the British who had such a great empire were also afraid of them.
Lord Birsa Munda had not only stirred up the British rule with guns and guns but also with his traditional tactics.
In fact, when people get an inspiring leadership, the collective will power of the people over the power of the weapons is heavy.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight for political independence only against the British.
But we fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals too.
In his short life, he did all this.
In the dark life of the underprivileged and the oppressed, he shined like a sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at a young age of 25.
Mother India like Birsa Munda has come to all parts of the country.
There is no point in India where no one has contributed to this centuries-long freedom struggle.
Unfortunately, his words of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda had made us aware of his existence then a great personality like Jamshed ji had given a big institution to the country.
Jamshed ji Tata was a philosopher who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a hub of science technology and enterprises.
As a result, the TATA Institute of Science was established which is now called the Indian Institute of Science.
Moreover, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tat Steel.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on February 2nd.
You all are aware that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the owner of a simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is the record for presenting the highest budget in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India at a difficult time when there was a danger to the democratic tensions in the country.
Morarjibhai Desai jumped into a crispy anti-democratic movement to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price even in his old age.
The government of that time had arrested him and put him in jail.
But when the party won the elections in 1991, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also provided that the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be slaughtered in time.
It was for the first time that the President would announce the crisis only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet and it was also decided that the time of the crisis would not be increased for more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which the Crisis Ladies were killed in the 1955s cannot be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember his invaluable contribution to the upliftment of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this year too there was a lot of curiosity about the Padma awards.
Today, we are at the forefront of a New India. We want to honour those people who are doing their jobs at the grassroots level with utmost sincerity.
With their hard work, those who are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, he is a true Karmayogi who remains self-reliant in public service, social service and nation service ahead of all this.
I want to tell you about some of these people.
Talking about Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional pathogenic art of Kutch.
He is doing great work to bring this rare painting to the new generation.
The Tree of Life (Life Tree) manufactured by Abdul Gafoor was gifted to former US President Barak Obama.
In receiving the Padma awards, Shabbid Syed of Marathwad is known as the servant of Mother cow.
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of the mother cow, it is unique in itself.
You will be pleasantly surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America and Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he has trained people from all over the world in Yoga and till now he has made 1. 5 thousand people Yoga teachers.
Famous as Lady Turzon in Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu did adventurous work to face Timber's apology and extremists who not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also motivated ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to get an example of the work done by him for the upliftment of Divyang women, even though he himself is a disabled person, by establishing an institution called Pragyachakshu Mahila Sevakunj, he has been working towards making the visually impaired children self-reliant.
He has set an example to empower women and make agriculture profitable.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in their area to join the Self Help Groups to become economically legitimate.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about the experience that will touch the hearts of all those who have been experiencing this experience for the past few days.
Nowadays, whenever I go to the country, my effort has been made that some beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) scheme of Ayushman Bharat will be available to some beneficiaries.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how a big change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you all are aware of such a poor person who cannot get treatment due to lack of money then you must tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every such poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for exams in schools is about to start.
Different education boards across the country will launch the process for examination of 10th and 12th standard boards in the next few weeks.
I extend my warm greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers of the examination.
A few days ago, a major event of Pariksha Pe Charcha was held in Delhi in the form of a Townhouse.
The unique feature of the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme is that there have been open-hearted discussions on various topics related to examinations.
Some aspects came up which could certainly be beneficial for the students.
All the students can see this entire programme on your parents and teachers YouTube and convey my best wishes to all the warriors of my examinations for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, be it a matter of India or not of festivals
Speech should not be in our country for a day which does not have any significance, which does not have any festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivratri will take place and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, a special significance of it will emerge in our temple.
My best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I had got the opportunity to spend time with the Divyang brothers and sisters.
So he said, I remember the Prime Minister.
I am really impressed with the power of the youth with disabilities.
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, I meet every month with crores of families through radio.
Sometimes, while talking to you people, reading your letters or listening to the thoughts sent by you people on the phone, I feel like giving me the share of my family.
This is a very pleasant experience for me.
Friends, the election is a big issue of democracy.
For the next two months, we will be busy in all the elections.
And for years, I will continue to talk to you.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Shivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - i. e.
His fame was a scholar who had a wonderful footprint on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his entire life to the cause of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
It was the priority of Swami ji's life to ensure welfare of the farmers in every way.
Siddhganga Math used to organize animal and agricultural fairs regularly.
I have had the privilege of receiving the blessings of the supreme venerable Swami ji.
Kalamsaheb had written a poem on this occasion for revered Swami ji.
This poem by Dr Kalam Saheb reflects the life of Shri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is not only an integral part of our democracy but is also older than our Republic - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
In our country, there is no difficulty in ensuring that every citizen of India who is a registered voter gets an opportunity to cast his vote.
When we hear that a polling station is set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet above sea level, even in remote islands of Andaman Nicobar Islands.
Only for a voter
When we hear these things, it is natural for the Election Commission to be proud.
Keeping in mind a voter, it provides an opportunity to the voter to use his voter, so that the entire team of ECI employees goes to the remotest corners of the country and arranges for the voting and that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its relentless efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, there will be an election to the Lok Sabha in our country. This will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
For them, an opportunity has come to take responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to become part of the decision making process in the country.
It's time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to cast their votes.
Each one of us must realise that becoming a voter in the country, achieving the right to vote is an important milestone in the important achievements of life.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote - this feeling should remain in us continuously.
There should be a lot of pain if one cannot vote for any reason in life.
If there is something wrong in the country then it should be sad.
I urge the renowned personalities of the country to collectively raise awareness among the people about the registration of voters or voting on the day of polls.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some amazing work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary with a different style.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You are aware that many rooms and buildings have been closed since independence in the Red Fort.
They have converted the closed Red Fort rooms into a very beautiful museum. The museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army Yad-e-Jallian and the museum dedicated to 185 Indias first freedom struggle and the entire campus has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
The aroma of our glorious history lies in each and every brick of these museums.
At the corners of the museum, the words that reflect the heroes of our freedom struggle inspire us to enter into history.
At this place, the British ruled over the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji at the Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort, the members of Netaji's family gifted me a special cap.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
I kept the cap in the museum so that people visiting the museum can see the cap and take inspiration from the patriotism.
In fact, the patriotism and patriotism of our heroes need to be repeated in different ways to the new generation.
Just a month ago, on 30th December, I visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted in the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had hoisted the tricolor five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there was such a tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion of the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organiser.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with spectacular slogans like 'Delhi Chalo', 'Tum Muse Khaundo', 'May Tumhe Azad Dunga'.
For many years, there has been a demand that files related to Netaji should be made public and I am glad that we have been able to do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family had visited the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we did a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is the 26 Alipur Road connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar or the Sardar Patel Museum or the Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a case related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting people, like Netaji had a close relationship with the radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and with the people of the country through a radio.
I was told that it used to broadcast radio stations, weekly news bulletins that used to live in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangladesh, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
In the operation of this radio station, the resident of Gujarat M.
Vyas Ji played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual museum has also been built in this revolutionary temple .
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and artworks of the three centuries old.
The museum exhibits excellent works of great artists like Amrit Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Seloz Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge you all to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you must be wondering that things are happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent work done by Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has painted a number of themes.
He has also painted animals and birds, he has painted many beautiful sceneries, and has also worked to bring human characters to the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his work.
He believed that those who saw their paintings should themselves understand the paintings and see the messages given by them in the pictures from their perspective.
His pictures are also exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope that you will definitely see their pictures in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
It was such a saint Sant Ravidas.
1st February is the birth anniversary of Ravidas.
Sant Ravidas ji's Doha is very famous.
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to understand the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the true meaning of labour prestige to the world.
He used to say - 'Man Changa Kathauti Me Ganga' means if your mind and heart are sacred, Sakshat God resides in your hearts.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced people of all walks of life, be it the majesty of Chittor or the queen of Meerabai, all of them were his followers.
Once again I salute Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidhar has written on MyGov that I have highlighted the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
He also wanted me to ask the students to take interest in the space programme and think about going beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and the message given to our children in particular.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
The Kalam-Set created by our students on 24th January has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
Since the independence of the country, the number of space missions that have been launched since 2014, almost the same space mission has started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously along with the same spacecraft.
We will soon record India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan 2 mission.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way to protect the lives of people.
Whether it is air or rail or road safety, all these have been getting much help from space technology.
Our fishermen brothers and sisters, Navic Devices have been distributed among them, which are helpful in their safety as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
Under this scheme, about 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been geo-tagged.
Besides, nearly three and a half crore assets have also been tagged under MGNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country.
It contributes a lot to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellite has been a unique initiative, which has provided development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our limited competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
Sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme provides children a great opportunity to think and move beyond the limits which were considered impossible till now.
It is a vision for our children to keep watching stars and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whatever games will be played will be played and many talented and young sportspersons have emerged in Khelo India this time.
In January, about 6,000 players participated in 18 games at the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When the player performs well at the local level, he will also perform well at the global level.
This time, players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The lives of many medal winners are inspiring.
In boxing, young player Akash Gorkha won a silver medal and I was reading that Akash's father Ramesh Ji was working as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
She lives in a parking shed with her family.
So, Kaptan Sonali is a resident of Helvi Satara of Maharashtra's 21 women's kabaddi team.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and mother encouraged Sonalina Hunar.
It is often seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
However, Sonali chose Kabbaddi and performed excellently.
Ten years old Abhinav Shaw of Asanasol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Kamati, daughter of a farmer in Karnataka, won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we talk of creating India then it is the resolution of Youth Power that is New India.
These stories from Khelo India show that the people of not only big cities are contributing to the creation of a New India but they also contribute a lot to the youngsters and young talent from small towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to shine the toilet
Moreover, more than 50 lakh toilets have taken part in a unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is Swachh Sundar Shauchalay.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, people are also making it beautiful by making some pictures by making it colorful and you will also get to see several pictures of a clean toilet from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans to lead this mission in their Panchayats.
Share your clean beautiful toilet picture with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
Today, in collaboration with the people of India, India is moving towards becoming Open Defecation Free long before 2nd October 2017, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have also contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And that is why I am glad that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and six hundred districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and have crossed 8 in rural India and toilets have been provided to nearly nine crore families.
My young friends, the days of exams will come.
Himachal Pradesh resident Bhagul Sharma has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exam warriors.
Bhagul ji, thank you for raising these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the period of examination.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are busy in exams.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would surely like to discuss this topic in this programme of Mann Ki Baat today, but you will be happy to know that after two days I will be interacting with students from all over the country at 11.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I will talk to my young friends about all aspects related to examinations, especially the stress-free exams.
I had requested people to send inputs and Idea for this and I am very happy that a large number of people have been putting their thoughts on MyGov.
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall programme.
You must be part of this program...
You will also be able to see its vibrant spread through social media and the Namo App.
My dear countrymen, the 30th of January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
The entire nation pays homage to the martyrs at 11.
Wherever we may be, we must pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
Remember the virtue of venerable Bapu and to fulfil the dreams of venerable Bapu, to build a New India, to fulfil our duties as citizens.
May this visit of 2017 be successfully carried forward.
My best wishes and thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can transform our lives and together contribute to furthering the country and society
Many congratulations to you all for the year 2019.
You must have wondered how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to recall how India will remember 2019 as a country, its capacity as a 100 crore people.
It makes all of us proud.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's renowned institutions believe that India is making the country free from poverty at a record pace.
With the determination of our countrymen, the cleanliness coverage has increased to 5.
For the first time since independence, a tricolor was set on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government from the Red Fort.
The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue, in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was found in the country.
The country's name was elevated in the world.
The country was honoured with the UN's highest environmental award Champions of the Earth Award.
Indias efforts in the Solar Energy and Climate Change have been ranked globally.
The security of the country has got a new strength.
This year our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, so now we have attained nuclear power in all three water, space and space.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The country's longest rail-road pool Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the nation before Sikkim and the country's Soma Airport - Pakyong was inaugurated.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time India won a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
However, if I keep talking about the mandate of every Indian, our collective efforts, our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that even in 2019, this journey of Indias progress and progress will continue and our country will be able to scale new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, we lost some extraordinary countrymen in December this year.
Dr. Jayachandran knew for providing affordable and affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that he was always ready for the treatment of the patient.
He used to lease and visit elderly patients who came for treatment.
I'm thebeterindia.
He has read about his many such works that inspired the society on the Com website.
Similarly, the demise of Sulagitti Narsamma of Karnataka on 25th December.
Sulagitti Narsamma was a helping mothers and sisters in delivery.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas of the country.
Earlier this year, he was awarded Padmashri.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narsamma who dedicated their lives for the welfare of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to discuss the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past, some of our party workers have told me that some young doctors in the city are providing free treatment to the poor by setting up camps.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors and friends engaged in selfless service is truly praiseworthy.
Today, I am going to say this thing with great pride that due to collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
We got to read about Jaychandran and when we got the opportunity, we got the helpterindia.
I have been trying to know about such inspiring things by visiting the com.
I am glad that today there are several such websites that are familiar with many stories that inspire the lives of such informal people.
Like thepositiveindia.
Com is working towards spreading positiveness in the society and making the society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who bring about change in the society.
It is easy to spread negativity but many good things are happening around us in the society and it is happening with the collective efforts of all the 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a great significance in every society.
When sports are played, the minds of the observers are filled with energy.
We have experienced and experienced a lot of things in the name, identity and dignity of the players.
But sometimes there are many things behind it which are even bigger than sports.
I would like to talk about a daughter-in-law of Kashmir who has won the Gold in the Karate Championships in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and resides in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hania studied hard work and related matters and proved herself in a thorough vision.
My best wishes to all fellow citizens for a bright future.
Many congratulations and blessings to Haniyya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a daughter-in-law of 16 years of age.
You must have read.
Rajni has won the Golden uadrilateral in the Junior Women's boxing competition.
After winning the medal, go to a milk stall and drink a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni put his medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You are wondering why Rajni should drink a glass of milk
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji, who sells a lassi on a stall in Panipat.
Rajni said that her father has made a lot of effort to make her reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work in the morning before Rajani and his brothers and sisters woke up.
When Rajini expressed his desire to learn boxing in front of his father, his father enhanced his enthusiasm by availing all possible assistance.
Rajini had to start a booking exercise with an old sword as the economic condition of his family was not good at that time.
Despite all these things, he did not lose his courage and continued to learn boxing.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini.
And I also congratulate his parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting Rajini and for enhancing his enthusiasm.
This month, Pune's 20-year-old daughter Vedangi Kulkarni Cycle has become the fastest Asian tourist in the world.
It used to run around 300 kilometers of cycle per day for 15 days.
Can we not get inspired by knowing about this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents, we also get inspired to do something in the midst of difficulties.
If the resolution is capable and full of enthusiasm then the obstacles are automatically overturned.
Problems can never be hampered.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration in our lives.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals full of joy and enthusiasm in January like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi.
During this time, Surya enters the Makar Rasi after landing.
After this day, the day gradually starts to grow and the crops of cold begin to grow.
My best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the essence of our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered different, but individuals and worlds are the same.
A good example of our close relations with nature is the calendar based on festivals.
Along with festivals, there is a list of planetary constellations.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
According to the moon and the sun calendar based on the moon and solar moon, festivals and festivals are determined.
It depends on who the calendar believes.
Festivals are also celebrated in accordance with the status of planetary constellations in many areas.
Gudi Falls, Cheti Chand and Ugadi are all celebrated in accordance with the lunar calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the Sun Calendar.
Rivers and water conservation is particularly inherent in many of our festivals.
Chhath Parva - Rivers and ponds are associated with the sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people immerse themselves in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals also give us an understanding of social values.
On the one hand, it has an ancient significance, on the other hand, every festival can easily learn the inspiration to stay with each other.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2019 and wish you all the very best for the upcoming festivals.
Share the photos taken on these festivals with everyone to see India's diversity and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of things in our culture that we can take pride in and showcase the entire world with pride and one of them is Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Even in films, there must have been a lot to see about its magnificence and enormousness.
People from the country and around the world come and join the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, a peoples ocean of faith and reverence emerges.
Millions of people from India and abroad are connected at one place.
The tradition of the Kumbh is brimming with our great cultural heritage.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Congregation to be held in Prayagraj on January 15, perhaps you all are eagerly awaiting it.
For the Kumbh Mela, the silos to reach out to the Saints have already started.
Its global importance can also be gauged from the fact that last year UNESCO has identified the Kumbh Congregation in the Integrated Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of several countries witnessed the preparations for the Kumbh and at the same time flags of several countries were hoisted.
The Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is likely to be held in more than 150 countries.
The divinity of the Kumbh will illuminate the magnificence of India in the entire world.
This can be a great experience especially for the youngsters.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on with great vigour.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for the Kumbh.
I dedicated the Integrated Command and Control Centre there, and the devotees will be greatly helped in it.
This time, a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If there is cleanliness along with devotion in the event then its good message will reach far and wide.
This time, every devotee will be able to worship Akshayvad after a sacred bath at Sangam.
This Akshayvad was a symbol of the people's faith in the fort for hundreds of years, which the devotees could not visit.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
I appeal to all of you that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep the different aspects and photos of the Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspired to visit Kumbh.
May the Kumbh of spirituality become the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh become a Kumbh of nationalism.
May this Kumbh of devotees become the Mahakumbh of national unity and may also become the Mahakumbh of the world tourists.
May this Kumbh of artistry also become the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have had an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa from where Mohn became Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firm in opposition to apartheid.
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, which echoed peace and justice across the globe.
2018 - the birth centenary year of Nelson Mandela, he was also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of racial conflicts all over the world and who was the inspiration of Mandela
He was inspired by the valour and inspiration that he had spent so many years in jail.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals also inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a DGP conference in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the world's tallest statue is Statue of Unity and there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen was discussed in detail.
During that period, I also announced the launch of the Sardar Patel Awards for National Integration which will be given to those who have contributed in any form to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength lies in its diversity.
Respecting Sardar Patel's spirit, we pay homage to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary is auspicious on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For a long time, his workplace was North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Birth place in Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India received his blessings.
If they want to live their lives then they get the glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had attained Guru's position at an early age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was a calm and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, he was wronged, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and hence it is said: "Seven lakhs to one fight, Chidio Sona Baj Tudantbe Gobind Singh ji
He said that power cannot be demonstrated by fighting against the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human misery.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice and compassion, who had a supernatural knowledge of both armament and science.
He was not only an archer but also a scholar of many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, Food Safety and Standard Authorities are being done by India.
Several programmes are being organized across the country to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
Under the Eat Right India Campaign, healthy India journeys are coming out across the country.
The drive will continue till 2nd January.
When India is clean and healthy, India will also be prosperous.
Nutritious food is the most essential for good health.
You should also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, we will talk about mindsets, be it the life of a person, the life of a nation, the life of a society, the life of a society, the basis of inspiration is progress.
Come, let us move ahead, let us move ahead, let us change ourselves, let us also change the country. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October, 2014, the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi, we started our journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat have been completed.
Similarly, today is the Golden Jubilee Episode Golden Jubilee Episode.
The letters and phones you have received this time are mostly in the context of this 50th episode.
On May Gov, Angukumar of Delhi, Amarkumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, similarly on Narendra Modi App, Monica Jain of Delhi, Burdwan, Prasenjit Govt of West Bengal and musicians of Nagpur have asked about the same question.
He says that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile app but why did you choose radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era, when the radio was lost, why did Modi bring the radio
I was in the month of November and I was going to some other place in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal Pradesh, it gets cold in the evening. And when I gave orders for tea then it was a very small dhaba, only one person used to make tea and sell it.
There was no cloth on top.
Similar was standing on the edge of the road with a small lari.
He said, No, sir, you don't know what, it's a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand it, he said, "Listen, listen to the radio, there was talk about it on the radio.
Communication and its depth, perhaps, cannot do anything equivalent to the radio.
In my mind, this thing has been done since time immemorial and I realized its strength only then.
So when I became the Prime Minister, it was very natural for me to pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I took charge as a Prime Servant in May 2014, I wanted the unity of the country, our glorious history, its valour, the diversity of India, the serpents of our society, the strength of the people, sacrifice and penance, to reach out to the people and to the people of India.
From far-flung villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals...
Recently, Akashwani conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these talents which are very interesting.
On an average, 70 of the people surveyed are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has increased the feeling of positivity in the society.
Mann Ki Baat has given a big boost to mass movements.
There has also been widespread discussion on indiapositiveness.
It is also a glimpse of the emotion of positivity and positivity in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of volunteering.
Along with radio, mobile, internet, Facebook Lives and Pariscope, Narendra Modi is also connected to Mann Ki Baat through App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of Mann Ki Baat family for their faith in it and for being a part of it.
Your fears are true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and millions and millions of listeners then what should be the need
Some young friends studied all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, analysing the word episodes, lexical analysis, and studying how many times the words were spoken.
Which words were spoken again and again.
One of his ideas is that the programme has been non-political.
When Mann Ki Baat was launched, I had decided that there should not be politics in it, neither should there be government praise in it, nor should there be Modi in it. And I got the greatest strength, the greatest inspiration for fulfilling this resolution.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain immortal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
It will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When will the strength of any government be so strong that the zeal of selfiewithdaughter starts from a small village in Haryana and spreads not only across the country but also abroad
Every section of the society, celebrities, all should be connected and in a new, modern language of conceptualization in the society, which today's generation considers.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat is a joke, but in my mind, 130 crore Indians live.
I have a feeling of his heart.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government - it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
India's original life is not political, India's original life is not political.
India's root cause is social policy and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one aspect is politics.
Everything happens in politics, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes events and politics dominate so much that other talents and others of the society are buried.
Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the talent of the common man gets the right place for the bright future of a country like India.
Your question is, in a way, a question that has been asked in a spiritual way.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are asking questions not to the Prime Minister but to your close friends.
If you answer the questions that you have asked, in the direct words, you will say nothing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple thing for me.
Every time letters of people come before Mann Ki Baat.
MyGov and NarendraModi, who share their thoughts on the mobile app, have a toll free number - 1800 11800.
People also record their messages in their voices by calling them there.
When the episode of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read very closely the ideas and information sent by you people during the visit.
And, for this reason, when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I would like to mention some facts like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
In fact, I have a voice in Mann Ki Baat but the emotions, emotions and sentiments belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet been able to name in Mann Ki Baat but they keep sending their letters and comments without being disappointed. Your thoughts and feelings are very important in my life.
I am confident that I will meet you all more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
Efforts are also made to ensure that the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat are also taken into consideration by the concerned departments on the letters and instructions.
With his hard work Mann Ki Baat reaches the maximum number of people.
Akashwani team prepares every episode to be broadcasted in multiple languages.
Some people efficiently speak of Modis voice in regional languages and Mann Ki Baat in the same tone.
Thus, he becomes Narendra Modi only for 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank those people for their talent and skills.
I would urge you all to listen to this programme in your local languages as well.
I would like to heartily congratulate my friends of the media who regularly telecast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Anyone is never happy with the political media, he feels that he gets very little coverage or the coverage he receives is negative but the media has made several topics raised in Mann Ki Baat.
There are several topics like cleanliness, road safety, Drugs Free India, Selfie with Daughter, which the media has innovated and carried forward in a new way.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete without your cooperation.
In fact, I do not have any secrets.
Whatever I am doing will happen to all the families as well.
In a simple language, I try to put myself in the youth, I try to put myself in the same condition and make an effort to create a harmonious balance with the ideas and to match a ballant.
It is that old bag of our lives, when it does not come in the middle of it, it becomes easy to understand anyone.
Today's youth is very much pleased that they will not do anything that they do not believe in themselves. And when they believe in something then they leave everything behind for it.
Sometimes people talk about the Communication Gap between the elderly and the elderly in their families.
In fact, interaction with youngsters in most families is very limited.
In most of the times, there is a hurdle in the matter of studying or habits or lifestyle, there is a problem of income tax and non-tax, there is a lack of comparison with open minds and gradually it is a matter of concern.
Discussing instead of accepting and dismissing the expect will make the dialogue impressive.
My efforts are being made to continuously interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always tried to learn what they are doing or are thinking.
They always have a storehouse of Idea.
They are highly energetic, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts of the youth as much as possible.
Sometimes there is a complaint that the youth asks a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that a young man asks questions.
This is good because it means that they want to examine everything from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth but I believe that there is no time for the youth to wipe out the same thing that helps the youth to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that todays youth are very ambitious and think of a lot of big things.
Good, big dreams and big achievements.
After all, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I tell you what is wrong with that
He is well versed in multitasking, so he does it.
If we look around, it is the youth who bring about a big change in the society, be it social internship or start-ups, sports or any other sector.
The youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and dream big.
If we bring down the ideas of the youth to the ground and provide an open environment to express them, they can bring about positive changes in the country, they are also doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji from Gurugram has written on May Gov that I should talk about the Constitution Day tomorrow i. e.
He says that this day is special because we enter the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vineeta Ji, thank you very much for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
It is a day to remember those great personalities who created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1947.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic task of building the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great personalities gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary speed at which he built the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the great talents of the country. Each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution for the country so that the people of India could be empowered and the poorest of the poor could be empowered.
The special feature of our Constitution is that rights and duties, i. e.
The combination of these two will take the country forward in the lives of citizens.
If we respect the rights of others, then our rights will be protected. And in this way, even if we follow our duties in the Constitution, it will protect our rights automatically.
I still remember that in 2010, when India's Republic was completing 60 years of its existence, in Gujarat, we took out a panorama journey of constitution on elephants.
It was a memorable occasion for the youth to raise awareness about the Constitution and connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as a Republic in 2020 and we will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all pursue the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contributions of those great men can never be forgotten who were at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
I salute Babasaheb on behalf of all the citizens who have given the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say - India's democratic values have not come from anywhere.
What is a democracy and what is a parliamentary system it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect our freedom after such a struggle till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be from different backgrounds but we have to uphold the country's interest in all these things.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony to society.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I recalled that time of Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara.
The Gurudwara suffered a lot during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat but the way the state government revived it along with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan, Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, after 50 episodes, we will meet again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I have got the opportunity to place the sentiments behind this programme of Mann Ki Baat before you because you people have asked such questions but our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the more our journey will become deeper and satisfying for everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
I would like to say today that one thing touches my mind about the imagination of Mann Ki Baat, while most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat while sitting with all the family members, it seems that the elders of our family are sharing our own words with us.
When I heard this thing in a big way, I was very happy that I am from amongst you and in a way I will continue to come here again and again as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat.
Your ambition, my ambition.
Let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October, 2018
Six and a half months before independence, on 2nd January, 1944, the world famous International Magazine, Time Magazine, had a picture of Sardar Patel on the face of the version that was published.
He had published a map of India in his main store and it was not a map we saw today.
It was a map of India shared in many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that India was facing threats such as partition, violence, food crisis, inflation and power politics.
Time Magazine further writes that if anyone has the ability to serve the nation in the spirit of unity, then it is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
How he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha
His authenticity and commitment to the country was such that all the farmers, labourers and industrialists used to trust him.
Whether it was Junagarh or Hyderabad or Travancore or Rajvad of Rajasthan, it was Sardar Patel whose swelling and strategic skills today we can see an India.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for seeing this nation and mother India bound by unity.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special. On this day, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
Settled on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is double the height of the US State of Liberty.
It is the world's highest skyscraper statue.
Every Indian can now take pride in the fact that the world's tallest statue is on the soil of India.
This Sardar Patel, who was associated with the land, will now enhance the beauty of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their valour but do you know why we all the citizens of India believe in this Infantry Day
This is the day when the Indian Army personnel landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the terrorists.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with Manekshaw, who was the greatest military officer of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manekshaw was remembering the time when he was a Colonel.
During this period, in October 1944, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said how during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was disappointed for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, while Sardar Patel looked at him in his special sense during the meeting and said that there should be no delay in the military operations in Kashmir and as soon as possible solutions should be taken out.
After that, the army personnel flew into the Kashmir-based airplane and we saw how the army was successful.
The 31st of October is also the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji.
The Prime Minister also paid tributes to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Our Para Athletes of the Asian Para Games 2018 held earlier in Jakarta got the opportunity to meet.
In these sports, India won a total of 2 medals and made a new record and enhanced Indias pride.
I was fortunate to personally meet all these talented para athletes and congratulate them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youth have done the best ever in the Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we received 13 medals and 3 second medals in mix events.
You might remember that this time India's performance in Asian sports too was excellent.
See, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best, the most glorious words ever.
This is the story of todays Indian sports which is touching new heights day by day.
India is not only creating new records in sports but also in those fields.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won the Gold Medal in Athletics for the country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He is a Divyang from his birth.
When he was eight years old, he lost his father.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a driver in Dhaba to clean the buses of DTC and to drive the roadside in Delhi.
Today, the same Narayan International events have been winning gold medals for India.
Moreover, see the rising maiden of excellence in India's sports, India never won an Olympic Medal in Judo, whether it was a senior level or a junior level.
But Tababi Devi made history by winning a silver medal in your youth Olympics.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsperson, lives in a village in Manipur.
His father is a labourer while his mother works for selling fish.
There have been times in front of his family when he did not even have food money.
Even in such circumstances, the courage of Tababi Devi will not be overwhelming.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are countless stories.
Every life is an inspiration.
Every young sportsperson is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that we had successfully organized the FIFA U-1 1 World Cup in 2019.
The entire world appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
FIFA UNDER 1 World Cup also created a new record about the number of spectators.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and increased the courage of young players.
This year, India is fortunate to host the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian, whether it is sports or sports or any other sportsperson, must have an attachment to hockey.
India has a golden history in hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in several tournaments and has been a World Cup winner once.
India has also given hockey a number of great players.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world is familiar with Hockey's magician Major Dhyan Chand.
After him, Hockey has cut a huge commodity from Balwinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the players of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey due to their hard work and achievements.
There is a good opportunity for sports lovers to see thrilling matches.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only encourage the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing in their support and I also convey my best wishes to all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming volunteers for this thing, it is inspiring and passionate for all the countrymen.
But today, in a new era, in a new generation, with new zeal, with new zeal and enthusiasm, we are coming forward to do these things with new dreams.
Every Indian will feel proud to see the enthusiasm and zeal that they have for this work.
It is an aroma of the journey from age to age, from self to world.
Somebody is educating children and somebody is educating the elderly.
Somebody is engaged in cleanliness and somebody is helping the farmers and there is no lust behind doing that but it has a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man himself learnt a wheelchair basketball to help the Divyangs wheelchair basketball team.
The dedication and dedication of this mission is the activity that follows.
Wouldn't any Indian be proud of this
This spirit of 'Main Nahin Hum' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was seeing your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I got a very interesting copy of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov - Please talk about how the practices and traditions of Indian tribes are a great example of coexistence with nature.
We need to learn something from our traditions for sustainable development.
I compliment you for keeping this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one of the topics that inspire us to look at our glorious past and culture, the entire world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways to balanced lifestyle.
However, our India is not free from this problem, but for its sake, we are just going to do our job, we are going to see our rich history and traditions, and especially the lives of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature has been a part of the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Central India, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship the trees like Peepal and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
In particular, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for the conservation of trees, but they are not allowed to damage even a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
He considers them as his brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger is also seen as the protector of the forest.
In Maharashtra, the people of the Warli community consider tigers as guests and they are prosperous to have a tiger presence.
There is a belief in the Coal community in central India that their own fate is associated with the tiger and if the tiger does not get food then the village should also be hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the river Kathan in the season of confluence.
They consider these areas as refugees of fish, which is why they get healthy and plenty of fish.
Adivasi community makes their homes naturally strong and environmentally friendly.
In the solitary areas of the Nilgiri plateau of South India, a small wandering community is traditionally made up of locally available habitations.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a fact that the tribal community believes in living in peaceful and mutually confluence but when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against British rule to protect his wild land
There are many examples of the tribal community that we have to learn how to live in harmony with nature and the country is indebted to our tribal people for the forest wealth that we have saved today.
Let us express our respect for him.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which appear to be normal at first glance but in reality, they have a deep impact on changing their mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the farmer brother Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
A common and hardworking farmer was the daughter of Gurubachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry smoothly.
There is no need to spend on life, on other things.
Some things may be difficult to provide for the family members of the daughter but you will be surprised to know that the straightforward farmer who was a brother Gurubachan Singh, the condition that he said to the poor is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji asked him to promise me that now you will not be able to afford the consumption.
You can imagine how big a social force is in it.
Gurubachan Singh ji seems to be very valuable but it shows how enormous his personality is. And we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform personal events into social interests.
A similar example has been set before us by the family of Shriman Gurbachan Singh.
I have read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who have made their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
All of you have been taking forward the Indian heritage of a healthy lifestyle as a true heir.
Just as Tipte Pe lake is built, small awareness and activeness and positive work always play a vital role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our texts:- ...... .. :: You mean, O God, there is a habit of peace in all the three worlds, in water, in the earth, in the sky, in the fire, in the wind, in the medicine, in the plants, in the garden, in the desert, in the entire universe.
May there be peace in the heart, in my heart, in the stars, in every part of the world.
India has a special significance of 11th November this year as the World War I ended 100 years ago on 11th November, that is, the end of 100 years will also be a century of mass destruction and the end of life.
The First World War was an important event for India.
In the true sense, we did not have any direct involvement with the war.
Yet, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have demonstrated their valour in difficult areas and in difficult situations.
It was the only objective behind all of them - the restoration of peace.
The world witnessed the destruction of destruction in the First World War.
According to estimates, nearly 1 crore soldiers and almost the same citizens have lost their lives.
With this, the whole world understood the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony do not mean a war.
There is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination, from terrorism to transformation, from economic development to social justice.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, Ishaan Bharat is something or the other.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is incomparable and the people there are very talented.
Our Ishaan Bharat is now known for its best practices.
Ishaan Bharat is an area that has made immense progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that the awards given for the best policy formulation in this field are similar to the Oscars in that field.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by leaving behind 51 nominal policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is coming to an end.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on these festivals.
I will urge you all to take care of yourself, to take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society in these festivals.
May this festival become an opportunity in your life to move forward as a mission and take a solemn pledge.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The progress made by you people will be as much as the progress of the country.
My best wishes to you all.
