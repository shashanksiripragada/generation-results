Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Deepajyotirnamastute
I salute this kind of Divya Jyoti.
What could be a better idea to remember this Deepawali, to spread light everywhere, to spread positivity and to end the feeling of enmity
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian diaspora participate in it but also the governments of many countries, its citizens and its social organisations celebrate Diwali with full fervor.
In a way India is realised there .
Friends, Festivals in the world have attracted tourists.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has immense potential for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, we should strive to connect people from other states and other countries with the joy of festivals.
We have so many different festivals in each state and every region that the people of other countries are very interested in this thing.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had to move ahead in this Diwali.
I used to say - let all of us celebrate this Diwali with the women power of India and the excellent success that we have achieved. This is the honour of the Laxmi of India.
Immediately after this, innumerable inspirational stories began to emerge in the social media.
Kodipka Ramesh from Warangal wrote on Namo App: My mother is my power.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today, we are in five good businesses.
Ramesh ji, my salute to our mothers
The song Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him, Major Khushboo is the Laxmi of India, the daughter of a bus carrier, who led all the women battalions of Assam Rifles.
For poet Tiwari ji, the goddess of India is his daughter, which is also his strength.
He is proud that his daughter is painting well.
She has also secured a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
Megha Jain has written that a 92 year old woman provides free water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Laxmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by people.
We must take inspiration, inspire ourselves and do the same thing in our surroundings.
I salute all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sanchi Honamma, a well-known poet of the 17th century, wrote a poem in Kannada language in the 17th century.
The same feeling, the words that we are talking about every goddess of India, the foundation stone of that thing was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how beautiful emotions and wonderful ideas are there in these poems of Kannada language.
Our daughters, these are our pride and the glory of these daughters is the strong identity of our society and that is the bright future.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is a day to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji across the world.
Guru Nanak Devjis influence is not only in India but in the entire world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are really dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I can never forget my visit to the Gurudwara of Vancouver and Tehran.
There is so much about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you, but for that many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be taken.
He always placed service at the top.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believes that the work of selfless service cannot be valued at all.
He stood up against socially evil practices such as untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji delivered his message to the world, far and wide.
He was one of the most travelling people of our time.
He went to many places and won the hearts of everyone because of his simple nature, humility and simplicity wherever he went.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had undertaken several important religious journeys which were called sad.
Whether it is north or south, east or west, taking the message of goodwill and equality, everywhere people, saints and sages met.
It is believed that the renowned Saint Shankardev of Assam had also drawn inspiration from him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Gurunanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water.
Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bidar, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Dev Ji who constantly remembered us.
During a sad hour, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
This has established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him as a Guru.
In Uzbekistan, they are the venerations they had visited.
During one of his distress, he also travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lived in the minds of millions of people who have been following his teachings with full devotion and are still doing it today.
Recently, ambassadors of about 85 countries had moved from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which marked the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
While all these ambassadors visited the Golden Temple, they also got the opportunity to learn about the Sikh traditions and culture.
Thereafter, several ambassadors put their photographs on social media and wrote very proudly about good experiences.
I wish that the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji will inspire us more to bring his ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I believe that 31st October will be remembered for all of you.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was a great hero of unity to the nation.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to bring people together while on the other hand he used to keep a good coordination with those who had differences of opinion.
Sardar Patel used to go deep into small things and examine them.
In fact, he was the Man of Dettels who insisted on penance.
At the same time, he was an organisational expert.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the systems of the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
And it has been decided that no one will face any shortage of water.
Moreover, he was keen to steal a delegate's luggage or shoes at the session site. And you will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel had done this thing.
He urged the farmers to come in contact with the farmers and make Khadi crops.
The farmers made tasha vines and sold them to the delegates.
We put our shoes in these cloaks and kept the cloaks with us so the pressure of the delegates to steal shoes went away.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
They did an important job in ensuring fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for discrimination based on caste and creed.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a very great work of uniting the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai had a special feature that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, there was talk of his role in integrating certain regions of the country.
He told the Mudaliar brothers, Arkot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arkot Laxmanaswamy Mudaliar that they should take the people of Travancore and hurry the tricolor and throw the first tricolor in Lakshadweep.
Immediately after his orders, the Tricolor was thrown out and the neighbouring country was rushed to see the sight of Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that he should personally assure that Lakshadweep will get all necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is making significant contributions to India's progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that we will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, a statue of unity that was built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the worlds tallest statue.
It is twice the height of the statue of freedom fighter in America.
The tallest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian has a dignity.
You will be happy that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the statue of unity.
It means that everyday about eight and a half thousand people will see the grandeur of the statue of unity.
He reiterated the faith and reverence that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has in his heart and now there are several attraction centres like the Cholong Garden, Phulpakhru Garden, Jungle Safari, Nutrition Park for children, Ekta Nursery etc.
Considering the convenience of the tourists coming here, the people of many villages are providing such facilities in their homes and homes.
Vocational training is also being imparted to those who provide home-step facilities.
I am confident that the people there have started farming of dragon fruits and soon it will become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, The effigy of unity can be a subject of study for the country, for all the states, for tourism industry.
We are all witnesses to the fact that in one year a place has been developed as a world famous tourist destination.
People from the country and abroad come here.
Several facilities like transportation, comfort, guides, environmental supplementary systems are developing automatically.
A massive economic activity is taking place and people are creating conveniences as per the requirements of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month Time Magazine has placed a statue of unity among the 100 important tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of your valuable time to see the statue of unity.
But I urge that every Indian who takes time to travel should travel to at least 15 tourist destinations in India with his family, wherever he goes, wherever he goes, I urge him to spend the night.
Friends, As we know, every year 31st October is celebrated as National Unity Day since 2014.
This day instructs us to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
On 31st October, every year, Run for Unity Ekta Run is being organized.
People from all walks of life, from all walks of life, from all walks of life will participate in it.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one and is moving in one direction and achieving one goal.
However, nowadays, people are seeing a metre and wad about the marathon.
The Run for Unity is also the next.
We are also running here, we are connected to Fit India and Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And because of this not only the body but also the mind and culture of the country is going to take India to new heights for the unity of India.
For this, you can get information about the Run for Unity around you in the city where you live.
In this portal, the portal provides information about the locations in which Run for Unity will be organised across the country.
We will all run on 31st October for India's unity and for our well-being.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had united the country.
This mantra of unity is like a culture in our lives. And in a country full of diversity like India, we should strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every level, at every level, at every level, at every level and at every level.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been active and alert to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had given its reply to the Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember that day, how was the atmosphere
How many different kinds of people had come to the ground.
How interest groups were playing games to take advantage of the situation.
What kind of language was language used to fever the atmosphere .
Attempts were also made to fill different voices.
On the one hand, everything used to take place to fever for two weeks but when the result came to Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, the political parties, the social organizations, the civil society, the representatives of all the communities, the saints and saints gave a very modest response.
Attempts are made to reduce the tension in the environment .
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us a lot of strength.
This is the example of unity that gives strength to the country.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed.
Today I also pay my homage to the country.
My dear countrymen, what kind of stories can be heard in every household today, what kind of stories can be heard from every village, what kind of stories can be heard in every corner of India from north to south, east to west
Every individual, every family and every village feels comfortable in terms of cleanliness because this effort is made by 1. 25 billion Indians.
25 billion Indians are also the owners of their results.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I have heard that I would like to tell you.
Just imagine, the highest battlefield in the world, where temperatures slide from zero to fifty degrees Celsius.
The name of oxygen is oxygen in air .
Staying in such a difficult situation is also not less than a bravery.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only trying to protect the country's borders but are also running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I appreciate the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold here that it is also difficult to see some disruptions.
In such a scenario, isolation and management of waste is an important task.
In such a scenario, 130 tons of garbage was removed from the glacier and its surroundings and in such a delicate environment.
We all know that Siachen is such a part that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those living in the lower areas and also using the water of rivers like Nubra and bed.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a new spiritual festival in our entire life.
And in Deepawali, especially in every family, it is happening to buy something or the other from the market.
The more we try to purchase local items the more 'Gandhi 150' will be a great opportunity.
And I urge that we should buy something that is manufactured by our weavers, hand made by our Khadiwala.
Even in this Diwali, you might have bought a lot before Diwali.
However, there will be several such people who would think that if they go after Diwali they will get a little cheaper.
There will be a lot of people whose purchases are still there.
On the auspicious occasion of Deepawali, I would like to urge you to come forward to buy local goods and buy local goods.
See how Mahatma Gandhis dreams can play an important role.
But sometimes the fire starts to destitute.
Somewhere wound occurs .
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, be it region, ethnicity, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated Parikrama.
We recall the targets of 2016 when our soldiers responded sufficiently to those who fought against terrorism.
In different parts of the country, our armed forces and exhibitions have been organized so that the maximum number of people of the country, especially the younger generation can realise their potential.
How capable we are and how our soldiers sacrifice their lives to protect our countrymen.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, I remind the youth of the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces and inspire them to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of bravery.
Our soldiers will give a befitting reply to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to promoting it. However, we are never inclined to fight with dignity and pay the price for the sovereignty of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a bravery by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries where maximum number of troops are being sent to the United Nations in different peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our soldiers have played an important role in ensuring peace across the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the people eager to participate in the Republic Day celebrations is the Fly past in which our Air Force demonstrates its capabilities by showcasing shining terrible airspace.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I congratulate all the air warriors and their families who are serving the nation.
In 1947, when Pakistan launched an indirect attack, the Air Force ensured that Indian soldiers and materials would reach the battlefield on time to defend Srinagar.
The Air Force also responded strongly to the enemy in 1965.
Who didn't know the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from infiltration in 1999.
The IAF drove him to the dust by showering a rough night bomb at the enemies' shelters in Tiger Hill.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the nation is grateful for the commendable achievements of our Air Force personnel.
His efforts to combat natural calamities from storms, floods to forest fires and help the people of the country are unique.
The Air Force has set a model for ensuring gender equality in the country. They have opened the doors of each of their departments to their daughters.
Now the Air Force is giving the option of 'Permanent Commission' along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15 August this year.
India can proudly say that along with male power, the contribution of female power is also being made in our armed forces.
Women are empowered and now they are getting armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our Naval Officers, Abhilash Tommy, was braving life and death.
The whole country was worried about how to save them.
You all are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian officer to travel the world with a small name without any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he has been advancing his pace to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean. However, the Cyclonic Storm has created a crisis in front of him.
I pray for the good health of Abhilash Tomy. And that is why this courage, his valour, his determination and the rare strength of winning will certainly inspire the young generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, even small children know what is the significance of 2nd October for our country.
There is another special significance on October 2 this year.
Two years from now, we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi across the world.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the entire world.
Great personalities like Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela derived strength from the thought of Gandhi and could fight a long battle for equality and dignity for our people.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important work of our venerated Bapu, which more and more people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas in the form of a constructive programme.
Later in 1945, when he insisted on the freedom struggle, he reflected in reforming these ideas.
Pujya Bapu placed his ideas before the countrymen on subjects such as farmers, villages, protecting the rights of workers, cleanliness and spreading education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujya Bapu was a folk gathering.
It was Bapu's habit that connecting people and connecting people with them.
Everyone must have experienced their unique features when they didn't know.
He gave everyone the experience that the individual is most important and absolutely essential for the country.
The biggest contribution in the freedom struggle is that they have transformed this struggle into a mass movement.
Reflecting the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, every section of the society, every section of the society bowed down to it.
Bapu gave you all an inspirational mantra.
Whether it is possible to capture our lives and parts
Whether it will provide self-rule to crores of people who are hungry and their souls are incomplete
Then you will find that your doubts have started declining and your ego has started to end.
My dear countrymen, one mantra of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, the growing economic strength of the middle class, the growing purchasing power of the country, while purchasing something, can we remember Bapu for a moment
Who is fortunate that this purchase will directly or indirectly benefit.
If the poorest of the poor is benefitted then I will feel more joyous.
Keeping in mind this mantra of Gandhiji, we should certainly keep in mind what kind of shopping we have purchased in the coming days, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, what kind of interest should we make in building a country because of our purchases and what kind of profit should all those people who have used their sweat, their money and their talent
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step of ours can be a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
But this was achieved that India got freedom.
Today, you can feel that my small work can also contribute immensely in strengthening the economic development, economic empowerment and fighting poverty.
This is the true patriotism in todays era. This is the work done by revered Bapu.
He said all these Khadi clothes have been made very hard and every dhaga should be used.
The intimacy of patriotism and the feeling of affection for the countrymen was rooted in the essence of this childhood nobleman.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji.
With the name of Shastri ji, there is a feeling of immense devotion in the hearts of our people.
His gracious personality is always a matter of pride for every Indian.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked humble from outside, but he was firmly determined in his mind.
His announcement of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' is a recognition of his great personality.
It was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that in a short span of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to scale the heights of success.
My dear countrymen, if we remember revered Bapu then it is natural that we will not stop talking about cleanliness.
Swachhata Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Crores of people participated in it and I was fortunate to have got the opportunity to do Shramdaan with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school where the foundation stone was laid by the venerable Baba Saheb himself.
People from all walks of life participated in the Shramdaan on 15th.
The institute also participated in the event.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Private Industries participated in large numbers in Swachhta Shramdaan.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those Swachhata lovers.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a success story not only in the country but in the entire world.
India is also hosting the largest global sanitation gathering in history, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC).
The sanitation minister and the experts from all over the world are working together to share their experiences and experiments on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude with the commencement of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on 2nd October, 2018.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: Justice Swarajya Sey, which means justice is at the root of Swaraj, whenever there is talk of justice then the feeling of human rights is inherent in it.
This is especially essential for ensuring freedom, peace and justice for the oppressed and the deprived.
The Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on 12th October, 1993.
In a few days, NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has worked to protect human rights and enhance human dignity.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister of the country, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had clarified that human rights are not a concept for us.
The emblem of our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) encapsulates all the buildings of the Vedic period.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society and for good democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with National Level Human Rights.
As a society, there is a need to understand and practice the importance of human rights and that is the basis of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
This year also, we should make efforts to organize a Run for Unity in our village, city and metropolis.
Running for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb as he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society, every part of the country through the Run for Unity. This will be a great tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August, 2018
Today, the festival of Rakhi Purnima is being celebrated throughout the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and trust between brothers and sisters.
Janmashtami will be celebrated soon.
He said that the atmosphere of elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal ji, Govinda-Govinda etc. will be overwhelmed.
The joy of coloring in the color of Lord Sri Krishna is unique .
Excellent Sanskrit-Dinmasti.
Sanskrit language, Sarala etc. Sarve Vadanti.
Brothers and sisters, Besides Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima Day is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
At the same time, we Indians are proud that from the Vedic times to the present, Sanskrit language has played a very important role in spreading the message of knowledge.
In Sanskrit language and literature, there is a lot of knowledge about every sphere of life.
Not only this, it is also said that Sanskrit language also mentions the mantras given in detail about the challenges of heat-growing in today's global problem.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village in Shivmoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language to speak.
You will be surprised to know that innumerable words can be produced in this language.
How important is the Guru's name in life, it has been said in a clear message that Ekampi Akshramastu, Guru's disciple address.
My dear countrymen, Monsoon rain brings a new hope for our hardworking and hardworking farmers.
This rain is a boon for sand, dry trees and dry reservoirs due to heavy heat.
But sometimes this storm brings destructive, catastrophic Mahapur.
Rainfall at most places with heavy falls at isolated places over the country.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover at the earliest.
But in times of such a crisis, humanity is visible to us.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody helps the people in their own way whether it is in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He made untiring efforts to save the lives of people stuck in the floods.
Whether it is the Air Force, the Navy as well as the Local Army, the Border Security Force, the CISF, the RF and the Army have played a very important role in the rescue and relief operations.
I pray that the country, especially Kerala, get the strength to get out of this crisis as soon as possible during this holy period of Onam and the development journey of Kerala gets a better momentum.
On behalf of all the countrymen, once again I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of the country that the entire country is with you all in this crisis.
For the last ten years, he had gone far away from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that the common man of India had a warm affection for Atal ji even after a gap of ten years.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has brought about two major changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of States has been restricted to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the Anti-Pacific Act was one-third, it was increased to two-thirds.
Clear directions were also fixed for eligible members to be eligible to be eligible.
Atalji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time of presenting the country's budget in the House was changed.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget in Parliament to tax in the morning.
Some of the rules in the Code have enabled the public to throw tricolor at public places.
This gave more and more Indians an opportunity to hoist their flags.
Atal ji did a great job to bring our favourite tricolor closer to the people.
Some people are expressing their views as opponents and as opponents.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India, he said, I pay my homage to Atal ji, the daughter of all of us.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will safeguard the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had heard about five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
In Rajasthan too, the courts of Rajasthan have decided to deal with such cases of atrocities against women in a similar manner.
The Act will play an effective role in curbing the atrocities committed against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the members have come together to present an ideal objective.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country for this thing at the public level.
My dear countrymen, crores of Indians are now looking at the ongoing Asian Games in Jakarta.
The Asian sports are still on the table.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has increased, particularly our daughters are participating in it.
Pay attention to your well-being because a healthy and healthy country can create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste Bhav ji, I respect our feelings.
Everyone was surprised to see Patan in Gujarat which was built in the 11th century by Rani Ki Bao.
The land of India is like a laboratory of engineering.
Several engineers from India have shown this thing that it is possible only in their imagination.
We have got this kind of gem in our tradition of telling the legacy of great engineers.
This jewel is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Visvesvaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built by him on the Kaveri river is still benefitting lakhs of farmers and the common man.
In Kutch it is called Bhunga.
My house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
I myself have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But go inside and see that you will not see any damage.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature and geographical structure of this place.
After seeing that house, I realized that even a long time ago, the engineers of that period had constructed a house by considering the local conditions, so that the common man could be safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think of the future.
Workshops should be held at places .
What new things should we learn in the changing times
What should people be taught
How to connect
Nowadays, disaster management has been a major task.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
In such a scenario, how can a new form of structural engineering be
How can it have different courses
What should the student class learn in this
Many such things should be thought out when Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivities.
Alongside, preparations for Diwali are also going on.
In Mann Ki Baat, you will continue to meet and speak Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, we will be working to take our country forward with all our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all
The people of some regions are still awaiting Varun Raj.
India is vast and diversified, but sometimes Varunaraja also shows its favourite character.
In such a scenario, one of the most important responsibilities comes to us that we should become nature-loving, the protector of nature and the protector of nature.
If we become nature-friendly, we will be able to achieve the balance of natural things by ourselves.
You must have seen this incident on television.
Actually it takes usually a few hours to go and return to that cave .
After reminding them that they could not come out, they took shelter in the cave at some height.
However, they did not have a day or two but had to wait within 18 days.
Now we can imagine how their moments would have passed in the state of mind when there is a direct death ahead.
On the one hand, these children were jealous of crisis and on the other hand, humanity across the world was united and manifesting the divine human qualities.
Especially after seeing everyone's humble behavior, I feel that this is a learning and understanding qualities.
Those whose children were stuck inside, their parents did not feel sad or their mother did not suffer due to grief.
But with patience and patience, the calm behavior of the entire society is extremely important.
A soldier from Thailand's navy lost his life in the entire operation of this relief operation.
The entire world saw and renewed the courage and courage to help those who were trapped in the cave in extremely difficult situations filled with water and darkness.
This incident showed that when humanity was united, such a wonderful thing happened.
But for that we only need to work calmly and stablely and focus on what we are working for.
A few days ago, our beloved poet Neeraj ji had left us forever.
Neeraj ji was a special feature of this thing.
He believed in himself along with hope, faith, determination.
Everything about Neeraj ji can be extremely inspiring and powerful for all Indians.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmer brothers and the youth.
Because there is a problem of getting admission in colleges during this period.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school and enter college.
Young people are walking on a new path in life, so their focus is on getting rid of the problem and getting rid of it.
Now the attention of the student goes from home to the hostel.
Students come out of the umbrella of their parents and come under the umbrella of professors.
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic about the start of college life.
For the first time you should leave the house and leave the village and go to the other side, you must leave the safe environment and become your partner.
Several youngsters leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you that you should remain calm and enjoy this life.
You must have to study but you must have a natural curiosity of finding new things while learning.
Old friends have a special value.
I can see how a student named Asharam Choudhary from a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh has achieved academic success while facing many difficulties in his life.
The first ever MBBS entrance examination for AIIMS at Asharam Jodhpur has been completed.
Similarly, Anushka Pandey, a disabled girl from Gurgaon, is suffering from a genetic disease of 'spinal muscular atrophy' atrophy.
All of them have worked hard to overcome all the difficulties faced by them by their determination and distress.
If we look at the gathering, we will find many such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country that has taken place in every corner of the country gives me energy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes fell on a news story and it was written in it: Two youngsters realized Modi's dream.
On reading the news, we came to know about how our youth uses technology in smart and creative ways and how they try to transform the lives of common man.
The incident was such that San Jose in America was considered as the centre of technology and once I was talking to the Indian youth there.
At that time I urged them to think about how they can use their intellect and skills for their India and take a short while and do something new.
I had called upon you all to get the answer to brain drain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpai ji accepted my request and brought a new vision to the fore.
Using our vocational skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together have created a Smart Gangetic App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the entire world but also provides information and information through this app on their mobile phones.
The residents of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, the village heads- Sarpanchs, District Magistrates, Chief District Magistrates, all have created awareness among the people about the use of this App.
In fact, it is a wonderful journey to Pandharpur.
Friends, This year, on the eleventh to 23rd of July, the festival of Vari is celebrated with a lot of devotion on Pandharpur.
Pandharpur is a holy city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In the footsteps of great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, he started walking towards Pandharpur with a thunderous thunderstorm.
Vithal, also known as Vithoba or Pandurang, visits Pandharpur.
Vithal is a god who protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense devotion towards Panduranga.
Go to the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
An important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood has been given through the literature of these saints.
The saints gave a mantra to fight against superstitions.
And he also praised the eradication of old evils from the society, and reflected the values of compassion, equality and defecation on the people.
Lokmanya Tilak was a sea of courage and self-confidence.
The British tried their best to prove him as an accusation three times in 20 years.
This is not something simple.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen about Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
At that time, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad to welcome him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with Tilak Ji.
During this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was deeply impressed by Lokmanya Tilaks personality and thoughts.
Lokmanya Tilak ji died on 1st August, 1920 and after that Patel decided to make Tilak a memorial in Ahmedabad.
The statue of Tilak was finally built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial on February 28, 1929, not by anyone else but by Mahatma Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you one more thing: Lokmanya Tilak is sitting on a chair and along with Tilak ji has written 'Swaraj Hamara Janmasiddhi Rights'.
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium for social awakening, collective work, harmony and equality among the people, besides traditional devotion and devotion.
In such a scenario, there was a need to unite against the British in those specific times.
And because of the festivals initiated by Tilak, he worked to break the walls of the society and to bring everyone together.
The popularity of organizing all these festivals in the Ogha of time can be recalled from the fact that today's younger generation is also very attractive for the heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today, in many cities, in almost every street, a pavilion of Ganesh Utsav is visible.
All the families of the streets together organise Ganapati Festival .
Our youngsters get good opportunities, their leadership qualities, festive composers, event organizers, coordinators can develop their qualities.
Everything from the statue of Ganeshji to the decorated things should be environment friendly.
Today, every Indian needs to have good results of good governance and development.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad led his life but he never bowed to foreign rule.
I am fortunate that Chandrashekhar Azad is the village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I got the opportunity to visit this village.
I also got the opportunity to pay homage at Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, the desire to die by the bullets of foreigners was not Chandrashekhar Azad, it was as if he had pledged to fight for freedom and sacrifice for the last time.
This was one of their specialties.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
India's brave daughter Hima Das has won a gold medal in the recently concluded 400m event at the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland.
Ekta Bhayan, another daughter of the country, has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia to reply to my letter and is now preparing for an Asian Games.
In our e-mails, unity has been written that one of the most important moments in an athletes life is the moment when a player holds a tricolor in his hand.
Unity, all of us are proud of you.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
The World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 won the Gold and Bronze medal in Tunisia.
We should move ahead, we should keep on sports, we should continue to develop.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place this month.
Once again I will definitely meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, today I have got the opportunity to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Recently, there was a historic encounter of cricket in Bengaluru.
You must have remembered very soon. I am talking about the Cricket Code between India and Afghanistan.
Both sides showcased excellent sports.
Rasheed Khan, a Goldman from Afghanistan, had done a very good job in IPL this year.
I thank our Indian friends for providing a platform to showcase their skills to our sportspersons.
Whatever is the best and best in Afghanistan, it is the representative.
You have experienced the spirit of sportspersons, what a sportsperson is.
Sports is a very good medium for uniting the society and showcasing the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will continue to play and develop with each other in a similar way.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June i. e.
Be it the European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, or the Japanese Naval Warships, people were watching Yoga all around.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme on Yoga has been organized and I am told that women have done guidance for several asanas.
Soldiers from India and China jointly practised Yoga on the high-altitude snow peak in Ladakh.
He is working to break the bonds of borders and connect everyone.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day across divergences such as caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world were participating in the programmes of Yoga Day with so much enthusiasm then why wouldn't there be any enthusiasm for its films in India
Our country's security forces have been practicing Yoga at three locations - soldiers, bases, navy and air force.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga on submarine.
Some soldiers performed Yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors were surprised by the warriors of the Air Force who performed Yoga asanas in the sky at a height of 15000 feet above the ground.
It may be mentioned that he did not practice Yoga by sitting in the air but waved Yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga was practiced everywhere.
Yoga has done the work of uniting people across the world by crossing the caste, creed and geographical boundaries and we have been keeping in mind the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam since ancient times.
Our sages, saints and sages have always emphasized upon this idea.
Today, Yoga has proved it in the right way and has shown it in the right way.
Today, I believe that Wellness is working with a revolution.
We see Mother in the form of gods, mother gives us birth and we consider her as gods, this is our culture.
Sometimes doctors give us rebirth.
The role of doctors is not limited to medicines only.
The not only cure but also affects the health of the doctors, but also has a very deep experience of how they should be able to lead their lifestyle, what should be the effect of style and what is the impact of routine on their health.
Indian doctors have displayed their immense capabilities and skills and have created a distinct identity in the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on behalf of all my fellow citizens for Doctors Day on 1st July.
India has a rich history.
When I was in Gujarat, when I was working there, the people of the tradition of Saint Kabir used to attend a national session.
Saint Kabirdas, a village in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, is well aware of this.
But we are aware of the fact that Kabirdas ji had chosen the place where Maghar had chosen to take the tomb.
At that time it was believed that the one who died here did not get a place in heaven.
And in contrast, whoever sacrifices in Kashi, he goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered a polluted place but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in such things at all.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through Sakhiya and Doha.
This was his ideal.
This is the ideal that we see from his writings.
It means that the one who understands the pain of the other is the true fakir , the Saint .
And whoever does not know the sufferings of others, he is ruthless.
Kabirdas ji had a special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and they should be honoured.
Though it has been so long, the words of Kabir are equally effective.
Today, we have read and heard the stories of Kabir ji. This is what we are talking about today's knowledge story.
We feel that their ideas are relevant even today.
I am reminded of a couple of words from Saint Kabirdas ji: Guru Gobind Dou Khadhe, Kake Application
There is such a great Guru, Jagatguru-Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the guidance to crores of people and inspired generations.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that serving the poor and the needy means serving God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the welfare of the society.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had started the Langar system in which a person of any caste, creed, religion and sect could come and feed on the kitchen barrier.
Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrating the 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
The Jallianwala Bagh incident will mark 100 years in 2019, which was blackmailing the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on his Jayanti. And in today's programme, I would like to congratulate Dr.
Between 1947 and 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed immensely.
He was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Come, let us all remember Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
On the other hand, I got the opportunity to go beyond the files and get to know about the changes in the lives of people.
In remote and far-flung villages, the youngsters are providing services through the Common Service Centre (CSC) from wages to passports.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to gather Sitafar and make its ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and going to nearby villages and providing medicines at affordable prices.
I am glad that the success of the common man is much greater than the success of the government in this entire programme.
The government cannot be credited with the hopes, enthusiasm and events that are taking place in the lives of the common man in such a disappointing environment.
The incident of a small girl from a small village in remote and far-flung areas also inspires 1. 25 billion Indians.
It is a pleasant and inspiring moment for me to interact with the beneficiaries through video bridge with the help of technology.
It gives new joy, new zeal and new inspiration to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in the video bridge programme and they worked to give me a new strength.
I would like to once again express my gratitude to you all for this.
On the one hand there are professionals and technicians while on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters working in the fields.
Now you would be wondering that agriculture and technology are very different businesses.
The schemes were formulated and successful efforts were made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, a chain has been created from crop production to its marketing and on the other hand, the role of the farmer brothers is very important and on the other hand it is also trying to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profits.
Friends
This work that you have done in your youth is really an inspiration for the youngsters.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
I will give the states the highest credit to improve One Nation, One Tax.
The GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the States decided to work together for the benefit of the nation and thereafter tax reforms were made possible at such a massive level in the country.
Till date, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and this meeting is being attended by people from various political ideologies.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of taxation systems in the country but now only one tax system is being implemented across the country in the new system.
GST is a victory of honesty and it is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, several times there were complaints regarding Inspector Raj in tax cases.
GST is perhaps the biggest tax reform in the world.
Generally, it would have been possible for a period of 5-7 years to improve such a massive population and to stabilize the entire scheme in a complete manner.
Namaskar recently hosted the 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
And when such an environment exists, no one will be left untouched by enthusiasm, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations and solemn pledges.
This was a time when people from all over the country used to think about which sportspersons would play today.
How India's achievements would be, how many medals you would win and all these were natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well in fulfilling the aspirations of the countrymen and won one medal after another.
Be it Nambaji, Wrestling, Weightlifting, Table tennis or badminton, India has done its best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze India has earned a total of 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
Winning a medal is a matter of pride and happiness for every sportsperson.
It is a matter of great pride for all the countrymen and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be shortened to express that feeling.
But I would like to hear what I have heard from these sportspersons.
Specially, this time there were several such things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals amongst all the contests that she participated in.
She is the first Indian woman sportsperson to win Indias first Gold in the Personal Table Tennis event.
India won the highest medal winner.
He became the youngest sportsperson to win a Gold in the Commonwealth Games on the 15 year old Indian leader Anish Bhan.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian Para Power elevator to win the Commonwealth Games.
The game was special because most of the medal winners were women sportspersons.
Women sportspersons showcased excellent performances be it squash, boxing, weightlifting or naming.
Everyone was eager to fight and India would receive both the medals.
The sportspersons who participated in the competition had come from different parts of the country and from small towns.
His friends have also contributed to those who have elevated their morale in every situation.
Last month in Mann Ki Baat, I had urged the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India, represent Fit India.
And I am glad that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Several people have written letters and expressed their support, sent letters, shared their health mantra - Fit India story on social media.
My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel happy and healthy because of the morning walk.
And he further says - "For me - Fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, we we are happy.
Devnath ji has no doubt that happiness is health.
Shri Dhawal Prajapati shared his portrait of Mountaineering saying: Travel and Mountaineering for me is Fit India.
I feel very good to see many eminent personalities motivating their youth in a very attractive manner for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many more youngsters have shared their experiences while participating in Fit India.
I believe that such a movement is extremely beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
One more thing I would say is the name of Fit India Movement without spending any money.
21st June is the significance of International Day of Yoga which is now accepted by the entire world.
You will also be preparing from now on.
Your city, your village, your department, your school, your college, every individual should try to participate in Yoga, be it male or female.
Today, I would like to invite you for a new work. And I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new during this time.
My young friends, I urge you to join a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - be it Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Division - have come together and launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 initiative.
The students of the college, the youth of the NCC, the youth of the NSS, the youth of the Nehru Yuva Kendra, who want to do something, who want to become a part of the society to change.
This is an opportunity for all those who decide to do something in the society with a positive energy and it will also strengthen cleanliness. And before we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be happy to do something.
Moreover, the UGC will also provide two cadet points to those trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will certainly succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us make use of these holidays as an opportunity to experience a new one.
This group of youngsters has started a massive campaign to educate children living in the streets and slums.
In the beginning, the condition of the children who had been seeking or doing big things on the road surprised them so much that they completely bowed themselves in this work.
This campaign, which started from 15 children in the slums near Gita Kalni in Delhi, has now reached to 2,000 children from 12 places in the capital.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this mission have participated in this massive effort to bring about social transformation by taking two hours out of their busy routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand's hilly areas have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
They have changed the fortunes of not only themselves but also of our region through collective efforts.
In Bageshwar of Uttarakhand maize or barley crops are taken primarily in Mandwa , Cholai .
They started making biscuits from these crops of the farm and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative societies in Munnar village and have set up a factory for biscuits there.
Recognizing the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only in the 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also in Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs but it has also reduced the migration from the district due to the employment opportunities provided to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be a war for water in the world in the future.
Everybody talks about it but isn't it our responsibility
Whether water conservation should be a social responsibility or not
Every individual should have a responsibility.
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered innovative ways to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have noticed that some temples in Tamil Nadu have written big works in temples related to irrigation, water conservation and drought management.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadeo, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will get to see a lot of spectacles everywhere.
Even today, various Vihiris are popular as tourist destinations, but we cannot forget that these are also the living testimonies of our ancestors' water conservation campaigns.
The UNESCO World Heritage in Gujarat, including the ueen of Adlaj and Patna, is a reflection of its magnificence.
Vihiris are in a way only water temples .
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chand Vihar in Jodhpur .
This is India's biggest and well-known diversity. And most importantly, this is the area where there is shortage of water.
April, May, June and July are the best time for storage of rain water. And if we prepare beforehand then we will get the maximum benefit.
MGNREGA funds are also used for water conservation.
In the last three years, everyone has made efforts towards water conservation and water management in his own way.
In addition to the MNREGA fund every year, an average of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, out of the total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore, 55 of the total cost of water conservation has been spent on works like water conservation.
Nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted due to water conservation and water management measures in the last three years.
The district administration under MNREGA has taken up the responsibility of conserving land and water in a big way.
Sasur Khadri has revived these dry rivers with the help of people from nearly 40-45 villages.
Be it animals, birds, farmers, farming, villages, this is a big success.
I would like to say that once again April, May, June and July are before us, we should also take some responsibilities for water conservation, we should also make some plans and we will do something.
When there is Mann Ki Baat then messages come from all sides, letters come, phones come.
Ian Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on Mygov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the philosophy of living the life of Rabindranath Tagore in the Nobel Prize.
Please deliberate on this subject in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people will get information about it.
I express my gratitude to INJI for attracting the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a man of wisdom and wisdom, whose writings have left an impression on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-faceted person, but he used to be a teacher every moment.
I was habituated to listen to Rabindra Sangeet on the radio early in the morning. And when I got the opportunity to hear the poem 'Aaguner, Poroshmani', I got a new consciousness.
You must have been fascinated by Rabindra Sangeet and his poets.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
In a few days, the holy month of Ramzan will begin.
The entire world is celebrating the month of Ramadan with full devotion and respect.
The collective purpose of daily routine is that when a person is hungry automatically then he also feels the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty then he feels the thirst of others .
It is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammad.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once an individual asked the prophets what is the best thing in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, Whether you recognize them or not, giving food to the poor and the needy and thinking of everyone closely.
He believed in his knowledge and compassion.
He had no pride in anything.
He used to say that ego defeats knowledge.
Mohammed was convinced that a person is not a source of wealth but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcased the power to serve and sacrifice, who guided millions of people across the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds one of Lord Buddha of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are the human values that are the most essential in todays world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar emphasised that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Babasaheb empowered crores of people be it Dalits, oppressed, exploited or deprived through the accident.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion.
To understand the sufferings of people, compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that the Buddhist monks travelled to different countries, carrying with them the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha and this always happens.
Throughout Asia, the legacy of Lord Buddha's teachings is found.
Many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar have deepened the Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings. And for this reason, we are developing infrastructure for Buddhism, which will connect important Buddhist sites in Southeast Asia to important Buddhist sites in India.
I am glad that the Government of India is partnering in the restoration of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Anand Temple of Bagan in Myanmar, hundreds of years ago.
Today, everywhere in the world there is conflict and human misery and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end the misery with compassion.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima, to all those who have faith in Lord Buddha and believe in the principle of compassion.
I seek the blessings of Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility for creating a peaceful and merciful world based on his teachings.
Today, when we recall Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is believed that Lafing Buddha brings a good fortune but very few people know that Smyling Buddha is also related to an important development in India's defence history.
Now you are wondering what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
Atomic tests were conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan on 11th May, 1998.
Twenty years ago, this test was conducted on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus, India has demonstrated its strength in science and technology.
We can say that the day marks its military might in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we are strong as a country, we take peace with each other.
This month is not only important for the country as it was conducted in the month of May 1998, but it is important that the way these tests were conducted.
This event showed the entire world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
When we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of May 11, 1998, every youth should take a pledge to contribute to the creation of a modern India, to build a strong India, to build a strong India by assimilating the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan' that Atal ji had given us for the power of India.
Participate your strength in the strength of India.
We can also get a new happiness and a new satisfaction to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, I visit the following Mann Ki Baat programme and amidst further distress.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is a sacred festival of Ram Navami.
A few days ago, when all the ASEAN leaders came here on 26th January, the art teams of that country along with them also came here.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of his countries have presented the Ramayana before us.
It means that Ramayana and Ramayana are equally effective and inspiring not only in India but also in the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, I have received letters, emails, phone calls and responses from all of you in large numbers.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about the opening of an online class of Sanskrit on MyGov.
Mr. Dhanshyam Kumar ji from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar read a copy on the Narendra Modi app.
The concern that you have expressed on the degraded water bodies of the land is very important.
Sriyut Shakal Shastri of Karnataka utilised the words very brilliantly and wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when Ayushman Bharat is there.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji asks me to talk about the health of the youth this time.
According to him, if we compare with other Asian countries, Indian youth is physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I had thought that I would discuss with everyone about health in detail - Strong India.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared all those photos and videos on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi app.
Now you can lick those photos and retweet them and reach out to your friends.
Anghha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written to me about the gratitude cards they have given behind the book Exam Warrior.
Anghha, Jayesh and all other children, I would like to tell you that my day-long fatigue is lost due to your letters.
So many letters, phone calls, reactions, whatever I got to read, whatever I got to hear, I got a lot of things to my heart.
Even if I decide to say the same thing today, I will have to say the same thing for months or months.
This time more and more letters have been sent to the children, they have also written about the examination.
I have been told about my vacation plans.
We have been worried that the animals and birds do not get water in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters for the kind of farming and farming that is being done in the country.
Some aware citizens have suggested measures for water conservation.
Ever since we have started this Mann Ki Baat with each other through radio, I have experienced one way since then that maximum number of newspapers in the summer come on the topics related to summer.
Press appears on the care of the examination of the student before the examination.
It means that things change according to the weather conditions and perhaps it is true that these things in our mind change the weather in some other person's life and why not change the weather
When I got to read in your letter how the rickshaw puller of Karimganj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, constructed nine schools for the poor children with his willpower.
When I got to hear the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary from Kanpur, he went on the sidewalk to feed the poor and treated them free of cost, then I got the opportunity to feel a sense of brotherhood in the country.
Several travellers from his cab helped him a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full salary.
Thus, after depositing 12 years of money, Akhir Saidul Laskar succeeded in relentless efforts.
Today, due to his determination and hard work, he has constructed a sick hall in the village of Punari near Kolkata with a provision of about 30 beds.
Today, the whole world has changed its vision of India.
Today, when India is named with great pride, the hard work of these sons and daughters of Mother India is lost.
A positive atmosphere of hope and confidence has been created.
This self-confidence, this positivity and the resolve of New India will be realized.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Shastriji, Lohiaji or Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as an integral part of the economy and common life of the country.
At the same time, Lal Bahadur Shastri also emphasized on protecting plants, plants and plants and better agricultural structure.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies, innovate and utilize them.
This state, which has a very small area, has done a great job.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have achieved record production during 2015-16 as compared to last five years.
They have proved this thing from their experiences that when the goals are certain, when there are concrete resolutions, if there is a will power to realise them then they can be fulfilled.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, an important decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get the right price.
It has been decided that the notified crops will be guaranteed at least one and a half times the cost of their produce.
If we talk in detail about the cost of production for guarantee, the labour and expenditure incurred on the farms, the hard work and expenditure incurred on the animals, the cost of the fares, the cost of the equipments or animals, the value of the seeds, the value of all types of fertilizers used by the state government, the interest on the capital leased, the rent on the farms and the farm lease of farms is not only the fare but also the hard work done by the farmer himself or the value of his labour will also be added to the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving the farming markets across the country is also going on at a rapid pace so that the farmers can get a fair marketplace.
Efforts are being made to bring together local markets, wholesale markets and global markets.
In order to ensure that the farmers do not have to go far off to sell their products, 22,000 rural markets in the country are being upgraded with the necessary infrastructure and will be linked to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and the e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to link agriculture to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our pledge, how can 1. 25 billion people join hands in paying their best tributes to Gandhiji
How should the theme of Gandhi 150 be logo
Let all of us together pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and take inspiration from Bapu and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
Earlier it was considered that the responsibility of the Health Ministry was to do all the work related to health in the country.
However, now all the Ministries and Departments, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, are working together for a healthy India.
Care of health is the cheapest and easiest way of preventing health .
Therefore, the more vigilant we are to take care of health, the more it will be beneficial to the individual, family and society.
Besides, work is underway at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up of health care centres across the country.
Today, Yoga has created a new identity in the world for preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga .
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home because of our commitment towards Yoga.
The International Day of Yoga this year i. e.
In the last three years, people from all parts of the country and around the world participated enthusiastically in the International Day of Yoga.
This year also, let us decide that we will do Yoga ourselves and motivate our entire family, friends and all others to do Yoga.
We have to make Yoga more popular with new and attractive methods to reach out to children, youngsters and senior citizens and to women and men of every age group.
However, the country's television and electronic media are doing various yoga programmes throughout the year.
But can there be some programmes for creating awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher but I am practicing Yoga.
However, some people have made me Yoga teachers by using their innovations and they have made some 3D animated videos while doing yoga.
I would like to share this video with all of you that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
We are also working to set up new centres.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to provide information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy so that their cost of medicines can be reduced.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been reduced by 85.
The cost of knee implant surgery has been reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, nearly 10 crore families i. e.
The total number of seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and better health care facilities to the people of the country.
A new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
Our goal is to make the country TB-free by 2025.
This is a very big task.
Every person needs to be awakened and he needs your help.
In order to get rid of TB all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Several years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialisation in the country.
Industries also believed that the poorest of the poor can get employment.
Today, the Make in India campaign is going on successfully.
In such a scenario, the dream that Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of becoming an industrial super power in India is inspiring us.
Today, India has emerged as the brightest star in the world's economy and the world's largest foreign investment is taking place in India.
The world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
Keeping this in mind, today Smart City Mission and City Mission have been launched to provide facilities like better roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Babasaheb had a strong faith in his self-reliance.
He was not acceptable that someone should lead a life in poverty.
Besides, they also believed that by providing some facilities to the poor, their poverty would not be removed.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India and Stand Up India are creating young innovators and young entrepreneurs in the country.
It was he who saw Jal Shakti as a nation power.
Babasahebs vision was to establish various river valley authorities and various water related commissions.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing at different sea coasts of India and infrastructure in the old ports is being strengthened.
Discussions were main issues in the forties, others were wars, cold wars and divisions.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar in a way laid the foundation for Team India spirit.
He spoke of the importance of the federal system and emphasized the need for the Centre and States to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of competitive federalism in every sphere of governance, in addition to the cooperative federalism.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is the source of inspiration for millions of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in a wealthy or respected family to move ahead in life. He showed us that even those who are born in a poor family in India can dream big, they can make efforts to fulfil them and they can also succeed.
Several people have dealt with Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India which belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward classes.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May, 2019 to commemorate the birth anniversary of Dr.
There will be separate programmes for rural development, poverty alleviation and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to join this programme in greater numbers.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days many festivals like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Baisakhi are coming.
Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who preached the message of non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Best wishes to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
The Prime Minister said that Lord Jesus recalled the inspirational teachings of Jesus, who gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, kindness and compassion to mankind.
Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
Many Thanks
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue but in everyday life we experience that water is colorless, it does not have color.
Whether it is rivers or oceans, why do we see the color of the water
This question came to the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
With this question, a great scientist of modern India emerged.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
His discovery is well known by the name Raman Effect.
On 28th February, Raman is believed to have discovered Light Scattering and we celebrate 28th February every year as National Science Day, which he received the Nobel Prize for his discovery.
In the field of science, this country has given many great scientists.
On the one hand, great mathematicians Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta have a tradition and on the other hand, Sushruta and Charak have a place of pride in health care.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India.
Satyendra Nath Bose has also been named after the famous Boson particle.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme at the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai.
It was a great joke to know about the miracles in science.
Artificial intelligence helps in creating robots and specialized work machines.
Nowadays machines are making their intelligence smarter through self-reliance.
This technology can be used to make life easier for the poor, the deprived and the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make life easier for the disabled brothers and sisters.
Can we guess about natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got the opportunity to visit Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There a young man had developed such a digital device that he couldn't speak. The dumb person had written that his voice was transformed. And we can talk to a person just as we talk to him.
I believe that at many such places we can use artificial intelligence.
Machine works as you wish .
But what we want to do from the machines is dependent on us.
The human endeavour here is of great significance, the use of science for the welfare of mankind and the use of science to scale the heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the light of the light, was lost many times in his experiments.
When he asked them about it, he told me that I have discovered ten thousand methods of not turning the lights into lights, that is, Edison made his waste his own strength.
Today, I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo with Yoga.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and sought responsibilities for their rule.
As a great sage, he questioned every aspect of his life.
He found the answer and showed the path to mankind.
In order to know the truth, the spirit of repeated questions is important.
Behind scientific exploration this true hoof is also an inspiration .
Do not stay healthy until the answers to these questions are not answered.
On National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and science.
May our younger generation be inspired to discover truth and knowledge and be inspired to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, In times of crisis, in times of crisis, in times of security and disasters, I get a lot of messages and people write something.
Pune, Rabindra Singh has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on Occupational Safety.
He wrote that the quality of safety in factories and construction sites in our country is not equally good.
On the occasion of Indias National Security Day on 4th March, the Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat address, Shri Narendra Modi said that the theme of Safety is Safety, which will enhance awareness about safety among the people.
When we talk of public safety then two things are important, principles and preparations.
Safety is of two types one which is essential during disaster and the other is essential in daily life.
In our daily lives, we are not aware of safety, but it is difficult to secure security during disasters.
If we remain vigilant and follow the rules and regulations, we can not only protect our lives but also save our society from adverse accidents.
We see that many things have been written about the safety of the workplace but they do not seem to be compliant.
The municipalities, municipalities, who have fireworks cars, should go to different schools once in a week or a month to make mock drills before the students.
It will have two advantages, the fire brigade will also get a habit of being alert and the new generation will also be educated about it and there is no need to spend on it. In a way, it becomes a part of education.
India is geographically diversified in terms of disasters and disasters.
The country has witnessed some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management of the country.
NDMA is swiftly escaping disasters like earthquakes, floods, storms, landslides etc.
Training and awareness play an important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to heat waves, NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness in this regard and organized a workshop.
This reflects that if we prioritise security, we can attain security.
The Fire Services, the National Disaster Response Forces, the Armed Forces, and the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces, help the people in times of distress.
NCC and Scouts also assist and impart training.
The joint exercise of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal was the first and widespread effort.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this budget, under the Swachh Bharat Mission, emphasis has been laid on waste to wealth and waste to energy for the villages through biogas.
Initiatives have been initiated to name Gobar Dhan, Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from dung and biological fertilizers but it was not fully utilized in India.
We are moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
Animal Husbandry, Farm Waste, Cooking Waste etc. are targeted to be used for bio-gas based energy generation.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged not only to look at waste but also to look at waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas in a big way and it will help in keeping the villages clean.
It will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal rearers.
Garbage collection, transportation, sale of biogas will increase employment opportunities.
An online platform will be created for proper implementation of Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers to the consumers and will provide a fair price to the cereals and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take the lead, create a saving group, create a cooperative committee and take advantage of this opportunity.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement for clean energy and green employment, and take the initiative to convert waste into wealth and convert it into dung money.
Different art works were made using waste.
Work schools were organized to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone put forward innovative ideas on cleanliness, charts and poetry.
A festive atmosphere was created on cleanliness.
In particular, the school students took part in it.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which this festival has been celebrated for waste management and sanitation.
March 8 is celebrated every year as International Womens Day.
Several events are organised in the country and around the world.
Women who have done remarkable work in different fields are celebrated on this day.
Today, the country is moving forward in the direction of women-led development by moving ahead of women's development.
On this occasion, I recall the thoughts of Swami Vivekananda. He had said that the ideal woman concept is complete freedom.
125 years ago, Swami ji's idea reflects on the power of women in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life. It is our collective responsibility.
We are part of a tradition where men are recognized by women, the son of Yashoda, the son of Kaushalya, and the son of Gandhari.
Women are empowered, empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of a New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good thing to me. He said that on March 8, many programmes are held on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women swachhagrahi 50 thousand raj mistri.
You can imagine what a big event is.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that will transform the cleanliness drive into a habit of masses in the normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, I had the news that Elephanta Island had achieved electricity in three villages after 70 years of independence.
You know that this island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai.
For 70 years, in three villages of Elephant, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Set Port had spread darkness in the lives of the people.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
I am glad that Elephanta village and caves have lit up.
This is not just electricity but a new start.
What could be a matter of joy rather than brightening the lives of the countrymen and enjoying their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated Maha Shivratri.
This month marks a special feature of the month of March, when the crops of the month of March and the shower of the Amra Mandir are blossoming.
This month is dear to us for the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March, Holi will be celebrated with fervor throughout the country.
Holi has a special significance as Holika Dahan has an important day to burn the evil tendency.
May this festival bring joy in the lives of our people.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, January, 2018
For the first time in 2018, I have been interacting with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
This was the first time in history that the prestigious guests of ten countries were present at the event.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention Prakash Tripathis letter.
It gives me great pleasure to see that today women are making rapid strides in every sector of India, they are moving ahead and uplifting the country's standards.
It is a matter of great pride and respect for the women of our country from the ancient times, their place and their contribution to the society.
There is a great tradition of great scholars in India.
Several scholars from India have contributed significantly to the creation of the Ring of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi cannot be known by many names.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society and her family in the shadow of unity.
Whether it is the great scholars like Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi of the Vedic period, the great saints like Akka Mahadev and Mirabai, or the rulers like Ahilyabai Holkar, or the brave Ranagini like Rani Lakshmibai, women power has always inspired us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He writes that the journey of our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman from the Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft seemed to inspire him.
Three brave women fighters - Bhavnakanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi - are now training in Sukhoi-30.
A few days ago, the Honble President started a new thing.
A group of women who have done extraordinary work in their respective fields, called on the President.
Our women power has done extraordinary work to break the chain of conservativeness in society and established a new record.
He showed that hard work, tireless efforts and resolves can be resolved to create a new path by crossing all the hurdles and hurdles faced by them.
Now this path inspires not only our contemporary people but also generations to come.
This book is available in the form of e-book on Narendra Modi website.
The women power of this country has played a very important role in the positive transformation of the country and the society.
Today, when we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention one railway station here.
Now we must have come to our minds what is the relation between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is the Matunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
There are women employees in all the departments at this station.
After observing the Republic Day Parade, a number of people wrote on Twitter and other social media: A million participants participated in the operations by BSF Biker Continent.
The lady was experimenting with adventure and surprised the guests who had come from abroad.
Empowerment and self-reliance are the same words.
Today, our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new image in front of the country.
The area of Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
With the help of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols, the Maoists have created a wonderful atmosphere here.
Adivasi women are making themselves self-reliant by running e-rickshaws in such hazardous areas.
Whether the introduction of a society's life is being done through the system of self-reform or not.
Continuous efforts are being made at the individual and social levels in our country against social evils and evils.
Recently a good effort was made in Bihar.
In order to completely eradicate social evils, a human chain of more than 13,000 kilometers was created in the state, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign, people have created awareness among the society against the evils of child marriage, embezzlement etc.
The entire state has pledged to fight against malpractices like Hunda and child marriage.
All the youngsters, mothers and sisters participated in this campaign.
Beginning from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna this human chain has been inseparably connected to the border of the state .
Our society should be free from these evils so that all the people of the society need to benefit from the true meaning of development.
Come, let us all pledge to end these evils from the society and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state and everyone associated with humanity.
However, after getting information about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, they have started procuring medicines from there and now the cost of their father's medicines has come down by 75.
It provides huge financial assistance to the general public, especially the senior citizens of everyday medicines.
Generic medicines procured are similar to the prescribed standards of WHO.
This is the reason why good quality medicines can be made available at affordable prices.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides cheaper medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at AMRUT stores of hospitals.
The only objective of all these schemes is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri M. Mangesh from Maharashtra has sent a photograph on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The separation of this photo inspires my attention.
In this photo, a grandson participated in the Clean Morana River Campaign along with his audience.
I was told that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the Morana River in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more painful thing is that in the river's vessel wild grass and water bodies were boiling.
Large amounts of garbage and dirt were being thrown on the river and its thresholds.
As per the Swachh Morna Mission, on 13th January, one day prior to Makar Sankranti, in the first phase, two kaths of Morana river were cleaned at four kilometres in four kilometres area.
I am told that Akolekar will continue this campaign every Saturday till the Morana river is completely clean.
This shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible.
It can be transformed through mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard that there is a lot of discussion about the Padma awards.
Every year there is a tradition of awarding the Padma Awards but the entire process of awards has been changed for the last three years.
Now any citizen can make a name for this award.
The entire process is being made online and there is transparency.
Now the work done by that person is being taken into consideration and introduced to the awardees.
You must have heard that you will be happy to know Arvind Gupta ji's work.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life creating toys for children.
They are constantly trying to understand the science of classical experiments by children from waste and thrown things.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country to showcase the paintings made in 18 languages and inspired the children.
Similar is the case with Sitava Jodti of Karnataka.
They are not only known as the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, Sitava has contributed to transforming the lives of innumerable women of Belagavi.
He dedicated himself as Deodasi at the age of seven, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only this, he has also done great work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam in Madhya Pradesh, Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He used to do a simple job as a tool but he had a verse to paint traditional tribal paintings.
It is because of this metre that he has received respect not only in India but also in the entire world.
The exhibition showcases their paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He was awarded the Padma Shri by recognizing the talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, Indias name abroad.
They have built more than five hundred herbs based on their memories.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri Award for his social work by discovering and extracting outstanding persons.
Today, I had the pleasure to mention another name, the 75 year old Subhashini Mistri of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
Subhashini Mistri, who sold utensils and vegetables in others' houses to build a hospital.
This crisis in his life inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals built by their relentless efforts.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there are millions and millions of people who work for the society around us, those who live for the society, those who dedicate their lives, those who have dedicated their lives and those who have worked for the society, those who have dedicated their lives, those who have dedicated their lives, those who have worked for the welfare of the society should sometimes bring them before the society.
Such people don't work for honor.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
The venerable Mahatma Gandhi returned to India on 9th January from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between Indians living in India and the world.
You will be pleased to know that Mayor of Indian Origin, Parliamentarians and representatives from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, UK, Suriname, South Africa and USA and many other countries have participated in the event.
I would like to thank the European Union for doing a remarkable job, familiarizing the people of Indian origin and informing people around the world through guidance.
Those who showed us a new path, the date of revered Bapu is 30th January.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or the world, be it individual or family or society.
Hello
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year and see Yoga as the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout the year, we talked about a lot of things together and shared a lot of things.
Innumerable letters, reactions and exchanges used to come from you for Mann Ki Baat. All these things used to give me new energy.
Now this year will change after a few hours but it will continue to be like that of our conversation.
In the coming years, we will also discuss new topics and share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, Christmas festival was celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm.
We also see the essence of the spirit of service in the Bible.
The Sun of Man Haj Kam, Not to Be Servod, But to Servah, And to Give Hij Life, Age Blasingto All Humankind.
These lines show the importance of service and the greatness of service.
Whatever is there in this world, whether it is religion, tradition or character, the invaluable form of humanity is familiar with service.
In our country we are talking about Nishkam Karma, Nishkam Karma means serving without expectation.
We are also called Seva Parmo Dharma.
Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansa and Shri Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhansa have said that service should be done with the spirit of Lord Shiva.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The valour and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values and lived on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji inspired people from all walks of life such as a Guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior.
He fought against tyranny and injustice.
He taught the people to blame the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these efforts, he suffered a lot at the individual level.
But they never gave up their feelings of hatred.
Every moment in his life, he continued to preach the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
This shows how great and unique his personality was.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to attend the Prakash Utsav organized in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
January 1, 2018.
You will be surprised to know that the New Year used to come and one January also comes every year.
But whenever I say "special", it really matters.
And I urge all of you to register your names as voters.
The entire country is keen to welcome us as the 21st century electorate.
While becoming a voter in the 21st century, you too would have felt a sense of respect.
Our vote will be the basis of New India.
The power of vote is the greatest strength in democracy.
Mat is the most effective tool to bring about positive change in the lives of millions of people.
We have the right to vote alone.
What should we have in the 21st century, what should our dreams be in the 21st century India
You will also be able to become the creator of India of the 21st century and it will begin in a special way from January 1.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be realized through the skills of this energetic youth.
When we talk about New India, it should be free from poisons like casteism, communalism, terrorism, corruption etc.
He should be free from filth and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding force in New India.
Let the youth of New India come forward and deliberate on how to make a New India.
They should also set a roadmap for us and a large group of those who are associated with it will be formed.
We should also move ahead and the country will move ahead.
Just as I was talking to you, I had a thought that can we organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Can the youth of the age group of 18-25 years come together to deliberate on 'New India' and find ways to make this scheme a youth
How can we fulfil our resolutions before 2022
What can we do to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi ushered in the freedom movement as a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the magnificent Divine India in the 21st century.
Today, innumerable opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and successful.
I believe that an independent system should be created so that the youth of New India can get information about these schemes in one place.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had told you about the importance of positive thinking.
Any work can be easily achieved in terms of positivity and enthusiasm.
People in English say, "Pesimism Lids to Wakenes, Optimizam to Power" in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had urged the countrymen to share the positive moments we experienced in 2017 and welcom the year 2018 in such a positive atmosphere.
People have given a very positive response to social media, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people have also shared some special achievements in their personal life.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-One, Phase-One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
a.
I got this loan very easily and my daughter could continue to study.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I will speak Bodal from here.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our Bhinnar village has taken up the work of National Highways in 2017.
Therefore, the roads here are getting better and the business is getting faster.
My name is Deepanshu.
I will be staying at Mohalla Sadatganj in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bevani.
There was a serious problem of water in our area and forty years we were dependent on the waterways of the Armed Forces.
Now we have become an independent waterway.
Come, let us enter the New Year with the joy of such small things, let us take concrete steps to move from positive India to a progressive India.
Now we are all talking about positiveness. Therefore, I also feel like telling you one thing.
I am very encouraging to learn about Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who has recently secured the highest position in the Administrative Service Examination in Kashmir.
Terrorism and misery have come out of this environment and secured first place in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He wrote the story of success.
Today, Anjum has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the country.
Anjuman has proved this thing that however bad the situation may be, it is possible to destroy the despair and despair through positive work.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir in the last week.
I used to get to know about the will power, enthusiasm and the dreams of those people.
They used to tell him in what field he wanted to progress in his life, this whole world was filled with hope and hope.
I used to feel frustrated with them. There is no despair among them.
They had enthusiasm, joy, joy, energy, great dreams and resolutions.
I was inspired by the Kashmiri daughters during their tenure.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, when there was talk of famous religious places not only in our country but also around the world, it was natural to know about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
Crores of devotees visit this world famous temple to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
P.
No one is big in this campaign, no one is small.
Every traveller considers it as a part of the worship of God and does something or the other for cleanliness.
Now, no matter how big a celebrity it is, no matter how big a celebrity it is, no matter how rich it is, no matter how big it is, everybody is ordinarily involved in this programme like a traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
A strong pledge for cleanliness is also taken along with a strong pace of means.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the venerable occasion of Bapu's birth anniversary, all of us have collectively resolved to make a Swachh Bharat, free from hygiene and a free India.
Efforts are being made at a massive level in the direction of cleanliness across the country.
The transformation is now visible due to massive peoples participation in rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan-2018, the world's largest survey for the next 4th January to 10th March, 2018, will review the level of cleanliness in the urban areas and the success of cleanliness drive.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4,000 cities and about 40 crore population of the country.
Whether or not there is a scientific waste management in the cities, whether it is open defecation free, collection of garbage, whether it is waste management or not, whether it is peoples participation in the process of changing the habits of the people, whether it is trying to create capacities and use some innovations for cleanliness.
During the survey period, various teams will be examining the cities.
They will also interact with the citizens and understand their responses.
Cleanliness App is being used and analyzed to improve different types of services.
Its not at all that the government alone is working towards cleanliness.
Every citizen and civil society association is also responsible for maintaining cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to participate in large numbers in the Swachh Survekshan.
And make a solemn pledge that your city should not lag behind in terms of cleanliness.
I am sure you must have got the habit of classifying dry waste and wet waste and you will be using different wastes like blue and green waste while waste.
The principle of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle for Waste is very effective.
Clean cities will be ranked on the basis of this survey, if the population of our city is more than one lakh, if the population of the entire country is below one lakh and the population of less than one lakh, then it should be our dream to achieve the highest ranking in the field.
And we should also make efforts.
And all of us should have a dream that our city is our endeavour, our progress is our nations progress.
Let us make such a solemn pledge, let us once again commemorate venerated Bapu and endeavour to fulfil the pledge of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small but if we look at them as a society then we become familiar with them.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
I understand that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go to Mehram or her male palanquin.
Specially, such bonds and rules are not in Islamic countries.
But in India, Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to note that our government has taken note of this thing.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue to grow on the strength of our women power and on the confidence of their talent.
And that is why our constant efforts should be made to ensure that our women get equal rights, equal opportunities for men and women on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
This year, the leaders of all ten ASEAN countries will be visiting India as chief guests for the Republic Day celebrations.
This year, on Republic Day, there will be 10 Chief Guests.
The year 2017 was special for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years in 2017 and it marked 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians to be present here on 26th January with the great leaders of 10 countries of the world.
Dear countrymen, this is the day of festivals and festivals and if we look at them then our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps no such day will be concluded that no festival is celebrated on that day.
May the coming year bring immense happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of us.
Let us move ahead with new zeal, enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolutions.
The festival of Makar Sankranti is being celebrated in the month of January, the beginning of the sunrise is going to begin in the month of January, which is associated with the nature.
Sankranti in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu has its own special significance.
All these festivals are generally celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
This is what we will say in 2018.
The Indian citizen will not be able to seek any respect for them.
They are far older than all of us at that age and are witnesses of different phases of the country.
I was fortunate to have had a telephone conversation with Didi before leaving for a foreign tour.
We had such a lovely conversation with our sisters in a small way.
I do not really speak a lot about such personal conversations.
Listen to them that Latadidi is eager to do everything related to the country even at this juncture.
The feeling of satisfaction in his life is linked to India's progress, it is linked to the changing India, it is connected to India that has scaled new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadidi Namaskar
I am talking to Shri Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I used to travel by air.
Lata ji: Okay, good.
What to celebrate on birthdays
And the realisation that we have achieved has been achieved through meditation and penance.
I really don't have anything.
Lata ji: Yeah.
I also get your letters and I keep receiving your gifts as well.
I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I can see how much work you would have done and how much work you would have done.
Modi ji: My mother is very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: But I will come soon.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Our homes will be filled with joy.
However, you must have seen that there are many people around you who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
It is called darkness under the light.
Perhaps this is not just a few words but an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Whenever there are sweets, clothes and gifts in our houses then we should go out for a moment.
We must ensure that at least those things which are more than the requirements of our homes, which we dont use now, those things should be given to the needy.
In many cities, many NGOs work with the start-ups of young friends.
They collect clothes, cereals, food and other essential items from the houses of people and find out the needs and deliver them to them.
The laughter glittering on the faces of many poor families will double their happiness, there will be more shine on our faces, our lamps will be brighter and our Diwali will be brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi comes home in Diwali in the form of good fortune and prosperity.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this year
In our culture, girls have been considered as goddesses because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organize programmes in our society, in villages and cities in honor of girls this year
Can we make a programme in honour of these goddesses of India in Diwali this year
There will be several daughters and listeners around us who are doing extraordinary work.
If someone is working to educate the poor children, if someone is working to create awareness about cleanliness and health, if someone is serving the society by becoming a doctor or an engineer, if he is a lawyer then he will try to judge someone.
Our society should recognize, honour and take pride in them.
This kind of honour should be organized across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Share more information through social media about the success of these girls and use hashtag Bharat Ki Laxmi.
We have launched a massive campaign called SelfieWithDaughter and it was spread all over the world. Similarly, this time we will also carry out the mission of Bharat Ke Laxmi.
Promoting Laxmi of India means ensuring the prosperity of the country and its people.
My dear countrymen, I had said back that Mann Ki Baat has a great advantage that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect interaction with many familiar and unique personalities.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a letter and he has written it in it.
I live in Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This year when the result of my examination was over, some people asked me whether you read the book Exam Warriors
I told him that I did not read this book.
But I went back and bought this book and read it two-three times.
My experience after that was very good.
If I had read this book earlier, I would have benefitted a lot.
I believe that if you are thinking about the new version of this book then you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers and some more labourers.
Thanks to Exam Warriors for reading the book two-three times and also for telling me what is lacking in it while reading.
My little friend has also given me a task, he has instructed me to do something.
I will certainly follow your orders.
What you have said that whenever a new version of this book comes, I will definitely try to write a few things for parents and teachers.
But I would urge you all to help me in this work.
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to our little friend and student Alina Tayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, through the press, through television, you get to know about the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country.
But you are aware that I am a common man like you, an ordinary citizen. And that is why the impact that can be seen on an ordinary life also affects my life and my mind because I am one of you.
Then I also heard that speech and also saw faces.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by Emperor Rafael Nadal of the Tennis World, who won the Grand Slam 19 times.
The audience present there welcomed him with enthusiasm .
He also praised Nadal, the donor who has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the fight against the past, he praised Nadal for his competitiveness and set an example of sportsmanship before the world.
In fact, on the other hand, the winner Nadal also appreciated the game of Danil.
There is a lot that can be taught to people of every class and every age group.
These are moments that are beyond wins or defeats, when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The thoughts of our ancestors were really commendable.
Vidya Vinay Upta Hartin Neuransi Kasya Manjujya. Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janayati Loksya Loksya Lochan Anandam i. e.
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is going to be really good for you people.
Disagreements will continue, differences between the parties will persist, but if some things are stopped before the spread is over then it will be of great benefit.
It becomes difficult to stop the things that grow at a rapid pace.
However, a lot can be saved if we wake up in the beginning and stop it.
With this feeling, I feel like talking to my dear youth.
You all are aware that the addiction of tobacco is very harmful to health and it becomes difficult to quit intoxication.
Because of the nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in them .
Its consumption in adolescents has an adverse effect on the development of the brain .
But today I would like to talk to you about a new topic.
You would be aware that recently the ban on e-cigarette was imposed in India.
E-cigarette is an electronic device different from regular cigarette .
In cigarettes because of heating of nicotine rich fluids a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
You may be aware of the dangers of cigarettes often but a misunderstanding about e-cigarette has been spread that there is no danger of e-cigarette .
Aromatic chemicals are used to avoid stinking like other cigarettes.
We have seen around us that there are several households where there are fodder chensmokers but still they stop others from smoking.
The issue of e-cigarette is different.
If someone smokes around us then he knows from his place .
Even if there is a smoke packet in someone 's pocket then he understands it from the base only .
However, it is not a matter of cigarette, so many adolescents and youngsters become unaware and sometimes they become addicted to their books, in their offices, in their pockets, in their pockets, in their pockets and afterwards they become addicted.
The youth is the future of the country.
Cigarettes have been banned so that this type of intoxication does not destruct our youth.
These restrictions have been imposed so that the dreams of the family are saved from destruction and the lives of the children do not apply to patriotism and the habits of intoxication do not spread to the society.
I urge all of you to quit this intoxication of tobacco and do not be careless about e-cigarette .
Let us together create a healthy India.
Hey, do you remember Fit India or not
Fit India does not mean that we should go to the gym for two hours morning and evening.
Fit India will have to stay away from all these intoxications.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is indeed a matter of great fortune for us that our country has been the birthplace and workplace of many extraordinary people who have spent their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many extraordinary people, the land of work and these are the people who sacrificed their lives not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope France will declare Mary Thresia as the Saint on 13th October.
Mr. Mary Thresia's work for the welfare of humanity in his childhood for just fifty years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very excited about the social service and education sector.
He built several schools, hostels and orphanages.
He established the congregation of the sisters of the holy family, which is still fulfilling his vitality and mission.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters on this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that as we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from single use plastic.
Looking at India's leadership in the direction of environmental protection, the perspectives of countries around the world today remain universal.
I am confident that all of you will be participating in the mission to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this mission in their own way but a young man from our country has started a unique campaign.
When I got attention to his work, I had telephonic conversations with him and tried to understand his new experiments.
Perhaps the conversation with him will be useful for some people of the country.
Shriman Ripudaman Belviji is making a unique effort.
When I first heard the plogging word then it was new for me as well.
You are running this entire programme in an innovative manner and especially in a way that the youth will like.
I heartily congratulate you.
Friends, The Ministry of Sports is also organizing a Fit India Plogging Run to mark the birth anniversary of respected Bapu this year.
Two kilometer plugging on 2nd October.
This programme will be held throughout the country.
We have heard from the experience of Repudman how to do this programme and what to do in the programme.
Through this campaign, awareness about cleanliness is also increasing in people along with awareness about health.
I am confident that India will take 130 crore steps simultaneously if 130 crore Indians take a step towards getting rid of single use plastic.
I once again express my gratitude to you all.
My best wishes to you, your team and your innovation.
I would like to inform you about one thing.
As a matter of fact, I will surely elaborate on the next episode of Mann Ki Baat. But today I have already said that we should get the opportunity to make preparations.
You must remember that 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So we should start preparing for it from now on.
We are going to talk about it in detail but there is still time.
Some people will be able to start the exercise and some other schemes will also be formulated.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit fifteen places in India.
Programme for stay at least fifteen places and one or two nights .
We should look at India, understand and experience it.
We have so much diversity.
And when people come on vacations during Diwali then they definitely go on a journey. Therefore, I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, Parvachi is now celebrated on 27th September as World Tourism Day and some of the responsible institutions in the world present tourism rankings and you will be happy to know that India has improved in the competitive index of tourism.
And all this has been possible due to the cooperation of all of us, especially by understanding the importance of tourism.
If we make further efforts, by the time we complete 75 years of our independence, we will certainly be able to scale new heights of tourist destinations in the world.
There should be joy and enthusiasm too.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated collectively so that the values can be obtained from this collectiveness, there is a new strength in the collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Group's "Vijay Karnataka" newspaper launched an initiative in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
If we give more information about nature to children, it will be useful for the future in terms of environmental protection.
Rida Nadaf, a daughter from Laxmeshwara, has written that she is the daughter of a soldier in the army and she is proud of this.
Wouldn't the Indian be proud of the army personnel
And it is natural for you to take pride in the daughters of that soldier.
Irfan Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is at a distance of 5 kilometres from his village, so he has to leave his house early and he has to return home late.
He suggested that he should not be able to play with his friends for too long, but should have a school near his house.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I got the opportunity to read that kind of initiatives were undertaken by a newspaper and that is why these letters could reach me.
It was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today it is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On this day of 1949, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India.
The implementation of the Constitution commenced on 26th January, 1950 and therefore we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to build the Constitution.
No area of life, no subject of nature has been included in it.
Equality for all and sensitivity for all are the hallmark of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the letters of our Constitution.
Whether it is citizen or administrator, everyone should behave in accordance with the Constitution.
It is the message of the Constitution that nobody suffers any kind of damage.
The Musuda Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of that committee.
He was playing a very big role.
He asserted that welfare of every section of the society will be ensured.
On December 6, we remember and bow down to him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas.
Babasaheb has contributed immensely to the country's prosperity and empowerment.
This is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, who was the son of a farmer to an iron man, also did an abnormal job of binding the country in a common formula.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
However, the country cannot forget that 9 years ago, on 26-11, there was a terrorist attack on Mumbai.
Today, the nation salutes the brave citizens, the police and the security guards who lost their lives.
The nation will never forget their sacrifices.
He has been prepared to destroy human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social structures.
And that is why the need of the hour is to be more aware of the forces of humanity.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
Indian Navy protects our maritime shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed along the banks of rivers.
Be it the Indus River, the River Ganga, the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and seas are both economic and strategic.
These are the gateways for the entire world.
This country and our land have an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
When we look at history, the king's navy was counted among the most powerful navy during the Mudra dynasty 800-900 years ago.
His navy was instrumental in transforming the empire into an economic super power at that time in the expansion of the empire.
Several examples of naval expeditions and research visits are still available in Sangam literature.
Most of the naval personnel worldwide have been permitted to join women in a very short span of time.
But in the Mars Navy, and that too 800-900 years ago, women had played a leading role.
The ladies participated in the battle.
The rulers had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can we forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his navy when it is mentioned
The land of Konkan having maritime heritage was included in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurg associated with Shivaji Maharaj were in the coastal areas or were standing in the sea.
The navy of the Marathas protected these forts.
There were large and small boats in the Marathas Army.
Their naval personnel were capable of attacking any enemy and defending themselves from the attack .
It is impossible that Marathi Arma should be discussed and Kanhoji Angre should not be mentioned.
He gave a new glory to the Marathas Armed Forces and set up camps of Marathas at several places.
The Indian Navy has contributed several times since independence.
Whether it is the Goa Liberation War or the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War.
INS Sumitra, a naval ship, immediately assisted in rescue operations and evacuated a number of fishermen safely from the water to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year, when there was a massive flood in Sri Lanka, three naval ships arrived immediately and helped the government and the people there.
The naval ship INS Chatiyal, a naval vessel, had provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingyas in Bangladesh.
In June, the Government of Papua New Guinea gave us the SOS message and helped us save the fishermen of their fishing boats.
INS Trikand, a naval ship, rushed to assist the naval ship in the wake of a naval attack on a merchant vessel in West Galf on 21 Nov.
This year, the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special drive from 1st to 7th December, to express pride and respect for the security forces of the country.
Throughout the week, children, elders and all of them put the flag on the national flag.
There should be a movement to show respect to the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
Anyone in your familiarity with the Armed Forces can post their experiences, their courageous actions, photographs and photographs related to them at Hashtag Armed Forcesflagday.
Inviting the army personnel in schools and colleges to know more about their military work.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to know more about the army.
This is also an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our defence forces.
The Fund is being utilised for the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyred soldiers in the war through the Sainik Welfare Board.
Let us also contribute to raising the morale of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
Let us also join hands for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is World Soil Day.
I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the Earth.
Everything that we eat is related to this soil.
In a way the entire food chain is connected with the soil.
Just imagine, if there is no nutritious soil in the world then what will happen
How lively is a strong damar
And that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there was a feeling of devotion towards farming, devotion to soil and respect towards the people.
Two things are of utmost importance in the lives of the farmers of this country, devotion to our soil, as well as scientific approach.
We all are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are also conscious of modern science and are using it in agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj Block and the farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used to use chemical fertilizers in an imbalance.
Production was reduced and farmers income was also reduced and soil productivity was also reduced.
Some aware farmers of the village recognized the seriousness of the situation and thereafter the village farmers examined their soil and advised them to use all the fertilizers, nutrients and organic fertilizers.
You will be surprised to know that the information provided to the farmers through soil health cards and the guidance received from them has shown positive results.
In 2016-17, the production of wheat grew three to four times and income grew by four to six thousand rupees.
If you want to take care of the crops then you should take care of the soil and if you take care of the motherland then it will also take care of you.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have prepared soil health cards so that they can get better information about their soil and harvest there.
We devote ourselves to Mother Dam but did we think that how dangerous fertilizers like urea are for the health of Mother Dam
Many scientific experiments have proved that more than necessary urea damages the soil.
The farmer is the son of Mother Dam and how will he sicken his mother
The need of the hour is to revive this relationship between mother and son.
Can our farmers resolve to eradicate the use of urea by 2022, which means 75 years of our independence
Once the sons of Mother Dam and the farmers took a pledge that the health of the dam and the land would improve at a rapid pace and the production would also increase.
There will be a real change in the lives of the farmers.
We are now feeling the rise in global temperature and climate change.
There was a time when it was getting cold before Diwali.
Now it has come to pass in December and it is getting cold in the morning .
It is our experience that the cold has begun to get out of the bedroom.
However, even in these seasons people who are aware work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But determination and determination were stronger than all of them.
An eight-year-old son could not speak but he took the foundation of the scheduled building.
When he woke up at 5 am, he went to the village house and asked him not to defecate in the open.
This child, who has been teaching cleanliness by visiting at least 30-40 households everyday, has made the village Open Defecation Free.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today, they are performing well in every field.
Whether it is sports or competition or social initiatives, our Divyangjans are not lagging behind.
You might remember that in the Rio Olympics, our Divyang sportspersons earned 4 medals in excellence and won the Blind Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several types of competitions in the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Watershed Competition was organised in Udaipur.
80 of their bodies do not have muscles, but look at their courage, determination and hard work.
He also won the Gold in the 70th National Para Watershed Competition and was chosen by Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralympics.
He is one of the thirty-two Para watersheds and will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to the young Jigar Thakkar.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born on this day.
I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow countrymen. And I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of us to enhance peace and harmony in our society and will inspire us all to give a new energy and a new energy to resolve.
(Phone Call) Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I speak from Kanpur, Neeraj Singh.
I urge you to once again tell us the best ten of the things that you have told through Mann Ki Baat in a year so that we can recall those things and we can learn a little more.
You have made a very good suggestion.
After listening to your words, I feel like putting more emphasis on it, I want to make changes.
Those people who live in our villages, those who live in our villages often say - forget grief and do not forget happiness.
Whether it is photography or be it a small thing or be it a small sound film, I invite you to welcome the 2018 in an auspicious environment, with good memories, with positive thoughts.
Share positive features on Narendra Modi App, MyGov or Positive India (Hashtag Positive India) on Social Media.
Enlighten others with inspiring events.
We must see the strength and impact of these collective efforts.
I will certainly try to reach out to the countrymen, in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat, the experiences of Positive India (Hashtag Positive India).
My dear countrymen, next month, I will once again interact with you all for Mann Ki Baat.
There will be a lot of opportunity to speak.
Thank you very much
Celebrated six days after Deepawali, Chhathparv is one of the most sincere celebrations of our country.
In which traditional rules ranging from food to garments are followed.
Chhath Puja is full of unparalleled festivals associated with the worship of nature and nature.
The sun and water are the centres of Chhath worship, while bamboo and earthen utensils and tanneries are useful in the worshipping process.
The world worships Ugwat, but in Chhathpuja it also gives us an essence of worshiping those who are certain.
The festival also includes the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
The cleanliness of the entire household, along with the cleaning of rivers, ponds, beaches and puja ghats enhances the zeal.
Surya Vandana or Chhathpuja is a festival of conservation, disease prevention and discipline.
Generally, this lack of food, this lack of inferiority can be understood.
However, it is a special tradition to eat Prasad after half an hour in Chhathpuja.
The reason behind Prasad being asked to eat is that ego ends and ego is such a feeling that a person becomes an instrument in the progress of a person.
It is very natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I firmly believe that Mann Ki Baat has been tied to 100 per cent of Mann Ki Baat with the people of the country.
Take examples of Khadi and Handlooms.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I always urge you for handloom, Khadi and you will be happy to know what the consequences are.
I was told that on 17th October this month, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore twenty lakhs was registered at the Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan store in Delhi.
You might be happy to know that Khadi and handlooms should be sold at such a large scale from the same store.
During Deepawali, the sales in Khadi's Gift Kupan grew by nearly 680 percent.
Sale of Khadi and Handicraft Handicrafts has also increased by nearly 90 this year as compared to last year.
Today, we can see this picture that the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how weavers, poor families and the families working on handlooms will benefit from this business.
However, from the experience of the past few years, I can say that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, Khadi for Transformation has now been replaced by Khadi.
Khadi becomes a means to empower and empower the poorest of the poor by bringing about changes in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the rural industry.
Mr. Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about his experience with my security forces in Deepawali and to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Mr. Tejas Gaikwad has also asked on the Narendra Modi App whether arrangements can be made to reach the sweet security forces of our country.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweets of our houses should reach the country's soldiers.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali brings me a special experience this time.
I respect every soldier of the Security Force along with all the countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that the security forces should protect the country while fighting hard and adverse situations on the border.
Whenever we get time, when we get time, we should know about the experiences of the soldiers and listen to their glory.
Many of us do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in the peace of the world.
Everyone knows the positive role played by the United Nations in establishing peace across the world.
And we believe that VasudhaivaKutumbakam is my family.
It is because of this belief that India has been active in various initiatives of the UN since its inception.
We all are aware that the proposition of India's Constitution and the proposition of the UN Charter both began with the words "Woy the Pipal".
India has always emphasized on women equality and UN declaration on human rights is a living example.
The proposal that was made in his Indian Frame, All Main R Barne Free and Equal was changed with the efforts of India's representative Hansa Mehta, and was later accepted as All Human Beings R. Borne Free Equal.
It was a slight change, but a strong thought was seen in it.
India's contribution to the UN Peacekeeping Operations through UN Ambassador
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
At present, about seven thousand soldiers joined the UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
As of August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
The effort for peace was made from Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, 20,000 patients were treated at the Indian Army Hospital and rescued innumerable people.
The Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also won the hearts of those people.
Indian women have also played an important role in creating peace.
India is the only country in Liberia that very few people know that India has sent women police units under the Shanti Abhiyan Mission.
And Indias move will inspire the countries of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to know that Indias role is not only related to peace missions but also in training of peace and prosperity in 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers have spread the message of peace and harmony across the world from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha.
Peacekeeping is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to do this by going to remote areas.
His memories blossom the glory of every Indian.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was awarded the Param Vir Chakrana.
Lt Gen Premchand ji made a mark in Cyprus.
In 1989, when he was 72 years old, he was appointed as the Force Commander for Operations in Namibia and served as the Freedom Commander of that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid the foundation stone for peace.
As a messenger of peace, India has always preached peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone should live up to peace, harmony and move ahead with the vision of a better, more peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, your land, such great personalities have served humanity with a sense of selflessness.
Nivedita, whom we call Sister Nivedita, is one of these extraordinary people.
Margaret Elizabeth was born Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name Nivedita.
The word "Profession" means complete dedication.
Later, he proved himself by working according to his name.
Yesterday marked the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
Swami Vivekananda ji was so impressed that he sacrificed his life for happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Nivedita was deeply distressed by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
The British not only made our country a slave but also tried to make us a mentally sinful person.
Creating inferiority and inferiority has been happening in our culture.
Sister Nivedita ji restored the glory of Indian culture.
He worked to create a national consciousness and unite the people.
They went to different countries around the world to raise their voices against anti-communicable practices on Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharti is known for his revolutionary poem Pudumri Penn, New Women and women empowerment.
It is believed that his inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita ji also assisted the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Through their writings and conventions, they helped in research and propagation.
It is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful to each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are examples of this.
In 1899, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
Nivedita did not take care of her own health and started cleaning the roads.
She was such a woman who could lead a comfortable life but was associated with the services of the poor.
People, inspired by their sacrifices, helped them in service.
He taught the people about cleanliness and service from their cars.
On his tomb, he wrote, "Hear Repository Sister Nivedita Hao Gave Haar All to India", where Sister Nivedita is resting, who passed away all over India.
No doubt, this is what they have done.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the heroes of New India.
Earlier diseases used to take place in older age, this is our concern and they are now seen in small kids as well as in the last stage of life.
Even among the youngsters, such a disease was caused by exception.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now called lifestyle disorders .
Such diseases should occur in the youth i . e . reduction in physical activity and changes in food habits .
This is the need of the society and families to pay attention to these things.
When we think about it then we will realise that there is no need to move ahead.
There is just a need to change our habits by regularizing these big things, by changing our habits and by changing our habits
Children should get the habit of climbing stairs instead of going to the elevators .
After dinner, the entire family should try to go with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in assimilating the sustainable lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorder.
30 minutes before school, its specialty is that Yoga is easy and accessible.
And I would like to say that Yoga can easily be done by a person in any age group.
It is easy to learn simple methods and to do something for everything.
There is no need for special resources and fields.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the field of sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have made the country proud in various fields.
India won the Asia Cup Hockey Trophy while playing hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best and on this strength, India became the Asia Cup champion after 10 years.
India had earlier become the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my best wishes to all the hockey team and their team.
After hockey, badminton also has a good news.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the Denmark Open Trophy while playing an excellent game.
This is his third Super Series Premiere Award after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, this month FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup has been organized.
Several teams from across the globe came to India and showcased their skills on football grounds.
I also got the opportunity to see one encounter.
There was tremendous enthusiasm in the sportspersons.
This is a big event of the World Cup, the whole world is watching us.
I was overwhelmed by the energy, enthusiasm and zeal of the young sportspersons.
The World Cup event was successful and all the teams performed the best.
Though India did not get a cup, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
Enjoyed this festival of sports from all over the world including India and this entire tournament became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers .
Football is indicative of a bright future.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their support and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, to justify the sentiments of all the people who wrote to me on Swachh Bharat, I will have to do Mann Ki Baat everyday and dedicate Mann Ki Baat to cleanliness only.
Some children send photos of their efforts and some of the youngsters get involved in it.
If there is a story of new initiatives related to cleanliness then the enthusiasm of an officer leads to a change in the mindset.
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report in which there is a tale of transformation in the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
A voluntary organisation called the Ecological Protection Organization (EPO) organised a cleanliness drive at Chandrapur Fort.
People did not stop or get tired of this campaign that lasted for two hundred days. They did the work of cleaning the fort with a sense of unity.
I was enchanted by seeing the photographs. Anyone who had been disappointed with the filth of the surroundings would have felt that the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled. So I would like to tell my people that you can see the live image of the youth of the Ecosystem Protection Organisation (EPO).
This will transform our disappointment into confidence.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on November 4th.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is a Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire humanity, and addressed all the communities at par with each other.
He emphasized the importance of women empowerment and women's dignity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji travelled 28,000 kilometers and during this journey, he taught truth to humanity.
Interacting with the people, he showed the path of truth, sacrifice and devotion to duty.
He gave the message of social equality and showed it not only through his words but also through his work.
He started anchoring and it created a sense of service to the people.
Eating together gave rise to the feeling of unity and equality among the people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered three messages of meaningful life - Remember God, work, work and assist in need.
Guru Nanak Dev ji created Gurbani to share his ideals.
In 2019, we will celebrate the 5. 55th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us then try to move on the path of his message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation for an unbroken modern India.
Today, we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he was not only a transformative thinker but also an obstacle in finding practical solutions to the complex problem.
He was an expert in shaping ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had invested India in one thread.
Make sure that crores of Indians can be brought under the shadow of one nation and one constitution.
He enabled them to overcome all obstacles in their decision making.
He honoured the place where there was a need to honour.
He used force where there was a need to use force.
He set a goal and guided a determination with that goal.
He could only do the work of keeping the country together.
They dreamt of a nation where all the people will be equal.
I believe that the ideas of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are always inspiring.
He used to say, We cannot stop any discrimination of casteism, all are the children of India, we should love the country and we should develop a future on each others love and goodwill.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and relevant for the Vision of a New India.
And his birthday was celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
I urge all of you to participate in this celebration of Run for Unity.
Dear countrymen, after Diwali vacations, with a new resolution and with a new determination, all of you have come to your daily lives.
My best wishes to the countrymen for fulfilling their dreams.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
All India Radio has completed three years of Mann Ki Baat.
Today it is 36th.
Most of them inspire me.
A lot of things are required to improve the government.
There are also personal complaints.
And I take half an hour in a month but people are sending their words on Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
As a result, sensitivity has come to the government.
And that is why this three year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for that.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba used to say, Non-Government, Non-Governmental.
Instead of being immersed in the subjects which have been supposed to be politically coloured, a stable mind has tried to engage with you instead of passing through them.
I know that three years later, social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
Moreover, I believe that the thinking made by such a shaking will be more useful in future for Mann Ki Baat.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should not waste as much as we are required to ensure that food is wasted.
After this I saw that I received letters from every corner of the country in large numbers.
Several social organisations, many youngsters are already working on this thing.
I realized that there are several people who work for the proper utilization of the food grains that are being planted in the cottage.
Once I saw the story of a sarpanch of Haryana selfie with Daughter and I told everyone about it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only in India but in the entire world a massive campaign like selfie with daughter was launched.
This is not just a matter of social media.
This event made every girl a new self-confidence, a new pride.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I asked the people travelling outside to send their photographs wherever they went on the theme of Incredible India, lakhs of photographs were received.
It came from every nook and corner of India, in a way it is a great opportunity for those who work in the field of tourism.
With this Mann Ki Baat, I realized how a small event can create a massive movement.
Today, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat for three years then several incidents of the last three years have touched my heart.
Every moment the country is being considered to go in the right way.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the country, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country.
I have understood and learnt from the countrymen during my three year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I salute the countrymen from the core of my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi was not a cloth but an idea.
Once again I would like to urge you to continue with the mission of Khadi.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with this feeling that the light of Deepawali will be lit in the houses of the poor.
This work will strengthen the poor of our country and that is why we should do this thing.
How to introduce new technologies, how to increase manufacturing capacity and how to handle solar energy
The idea is to revive the old methods of 20-25, 30-30 years.
The Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been linked to it.
Several people have been given new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries have started their training centres once again at Pampore in Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this region.
Now the resumption of this Training Centre will help in modernizing the new generation, weaving textiles and inclusion of new things.
People have also started giving khadi items while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect the minds of people.
Our Honble President started this work and the entire country participated in it.
Be it the elderly, the men or the women, the cities or the Khedegaon, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive today.
When I say Sankalp se Siddhi, we all are seeing how this cleanliness mission is moving towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts this movement, collaborates and contributes something or the other to realise it.
I express my gratitude to the Honble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it its work.
And it is a matter of great happiness for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programmes under the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign. And I have seen that some people are continuously working, they have decided that they will continue to work till the right results.
One thing is that we have to clean somewhere and the other thing is that we dont want to do dirtiness while being aware, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then there is a need for an ideological movement.
The Swachhata Hi Seva mission has led to several competitions.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on Swachhata.
Thousands of children took pictures.
He used his ideas to draw pictures on cleanliness.
Several people have written poems and during these days I post the pictures of our child friends and children in social media.
Whenever it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
These people have carried forward this movement with a very good spirit.
He is also leading the Swachhta movement in his own way.
We can see the enormous contribution made by the electronic media and print media in our country in the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Recently, a few days ago, I was briefed about the 18 year old young man Bilal Dar from Srinagar.
No, there is nothing like that.
Bilal Dar works for cleanliness for the past five-six years from the age of 12-13 years.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar. This lake is cleaning the lake by taking out everything from plastic, polythene, waste and waste.
Bilal Dar is a child at an age, but it has become an inspiration for everyone who has a sense of hygiene.
I congratulate Bilal Dar for this.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the future history is born in the womb of history. And when the topic of history comes out, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On October 2, we mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on September 25th.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the central point of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and was engaged in the work of Gramodya. And it is very natural to respect the work of his Gramodya when he is celebrating his centenary year today.
Abdul Kalam ji, the former President of India, had always spoken about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he was interacting with the youngsters.
He used to mention Nanaji's work with great respect and he himself went to the villages to see Nanaji's work.
Like Mahatma Gandhi, Deendayal Upadhyay ji was talking about the last person in the society.
Sardar Saheb had united the entire country.
Now we should move ahead with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We naturally say, Ekta-India attributes to diversity.
We take pride in diversity, but have we ever tried to realize this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen, particularly to my younger generation that we are in an awakening situation.
Summer is a holiday, Diwali is a day, we have to go somewhere else in our country.
People go out as tourists and it is very natural .
But sometimes it is a matter of concern that our people dont even see our country, they dont know the diversity of the country.
You must go out of the country, I don't oppose it, but sometimes you should also look at the places of your country.
If we look at the lives of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, one more thing reminds us that when they all traveled to India, they came to India and at the same time they lived for India and sacrificed their lives for the country.
All these great men had made extensive visits to India.
At the very outset of his work, he tried to understand India.
There will be value addition in tourism at a time when we do not go to Paramulla just as a speaker, we will go as a student and we will try to understand his life.
I have also got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four and a half hundred districts. And today, when I take this responsibility in India, the experience of the misunderstandings that I have made is very useful for me.
It does not take time at all.
I urge you all that unity in diversity is not just a declaration of unity in diversity but a repository of our immense power.
There are several types of foods and beverages in us .
If we keep eating a new thing everyday for the entire life then there are so many types that the first thing will not come back.
Now, this is a great strength of our tourism.
I am confident that even if you go out this time you will take my first mission forward.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
When you met the people there, send their photographs.
I believe that in order to promote tourism in India, there can be seven best tourist destinations in our state, every Indian should know about those seven destinations in his state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we tell you something about these places
Can we provide this information on the Narendra Modi App
Can we give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
Just imagine, if all the people of one state have come to know about this thing then I would like to tell the government to enquire about the information that has come from every state and prepare publicity literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
In a way, how can tourist destinations be promoted through peoples intentions
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, connect with me.
You can also become a major partner in promoting tourism in the country from October to March.
I invite you for that.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
I feel frustrated.
Something immersed in my mind.
Finally, I am a man like you.
The Indian Army has been awarded two heroes in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
Extraordinary because both Swatti and Funds were also martyred in serving Mother India.
You can imagine how a mental state will be prevailing in such a young age.
But Swati Mahadik, the wife of the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, took a firm stand against the difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months to complete his training and laid down his life to fulfil his husband's dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dubey, was a hero in the army and was martyred for his motherland.
His wife Nidhi decided that he would join the army and fulfill his determination.
It is natural for every countryman to have respect for his mother-power and for his heroes.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, there has been a great opportunity for the youth of the country during the festival of Navratri and Diwali.
This year, the FIFA U-17 World Cup is being held in our country.
I am confident that the announcement of football will start from all sides.
Generations of every age group will have to increase their interest in football.
This will not happen that our youngsters are not seen playing in the fields of schools and colleges in India.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
This is the time of the worship of Mother Durga.
How the whole atmosphere is filled with sacred fragrance .
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand, when the whole country celebrates festivals, on the other hand, there is a news of violence from any part of India, then it is natural for the country to be concerned that this is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
This is the country of Sardar Patel who laid down his life for the country's unity.
Our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence with equal respect for generations.
We have been hearing non-violence Parmo Dharma since childhood.
I had also told from the Red Fort that violence will not be concealed in the name of faith, be it communal belief or belief in political ideology, be it faith in the individual, be it faith in the tradition, be it in the name of faith or be it in the name of belief, no one has the right to take law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the countrymen that the country will never bear the burden of those people who are suppressing the law, those who are persecuted by violence or those who are groups and no government will tolerate it.
Everyone will have to bow before the law.
If we look at the cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events then perhaps in 365 days there will not be a single day in which there will be no coincidence.
Now you must have seen that our festivals are going on in accordance with the nature cycle.
There is a direct relation of nature with nature .
Most of our festivals are associated with the farmers.
First of all, I would like to call you Michami Dukkadam.
The festival of Santsari was celebrated yesterday in the Jain community.
In the Jain society festival of festivals is celebrated in Bhadramas .
On the last day of the festival of Perusalam, Sanskrit is celebrated .
This Kharch is a unique tradition.
The day of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it is a tradition of being called as Mishma-Diwas and having sweet potato on this day .
We have listened to this conversation and Mahatma Gandhi used to say - forgiveness is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare writes in his play The Marchant of Venice the significance of forgiveness, Marcy is twenty blest, Wit Blesset the hem the gives and the things that have been empowered, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great joy in every corner of the country.
When the topic of Ganesh Chaturthi comes then it is natural to speak on the occasion of Ganesh festival .
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for ten days.
This Mahasana is considered to be a symbol of unity, equality and harmony.
Ganesh Festival greetings to all fellow citizens.
Recently, Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colourful festivals in India, Onam is the premier feature of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
At present, our festivals seem to be a cause of attraction for tourism.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way.
There is also an opportunity to attract other foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
Id-ul-uha Festival will be celebrated across the country on the occasion of Kanhi Celebrations.
Id-ul-uha greetings to all fellow citizens.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us.
We have to make the festivals of our New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals are associated with cleanliness in family life.
Preparation of festivities means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it is necessary to have a social habit.
Publicly, cleanliness should not only be a part of the household but also in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
Eko Friendly Ganesha has launched a massive campaign.
If you look at you tube then every household is being constructed as a Ganapati by bringing soil.
Some people are painting vegetables, some are pinching paper pieces.
Different types of experiments are being used in every family.
And I feel very happy when I know new experiments.
Three years ago when Swachhata Abhiyan was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
Toilets have reached almost 67 percent from 39 percent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, Gujarat was flooded with terrible floods.
Many people lost their lives but when the flood water was reduced then everywhere was dirty.
On the occasion, 22 temples and 3 spices were systematically cleaned by the workmen of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat.
Everyone got out of their sweat.
The example of unity for cleanliness, the example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind gave an example.
If this becomes our sustainable spirit then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I once again appeal to all of you that once again, on 2nd October, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, Swachhata Hi Seva, just like I used to say earlier, Jal Seva is Lord Seva, Swachhata Hi Seva, Swachhata Hi Seva is a mission.
Make an environment of cleanliness throughout the country.
We should look for opportunities whenever we get the opportunity.
But all of us will come together.
On the day of the holiday or Sunday we will come together and work together .
We will go to the nearby villages but we will work with a movement.
I urge all the UNGOs, schools, colleges, social and cultural political leadership to the government officials, collectors and sarpanches to create an environment of untouchable sanitation for 15 days before the 2nd October of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary so that the dream of Gandhi Ji becomes October 2.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
In, a department has been built where you can write your name and the name of that family after constructing a toilet, which you have helped.
Friends of my social media can run some constructive campaigns and it can actually be an inspiration for the world to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp se Siddhi drive by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organising essay competitions, short film making competitions, painting competitions.
In this you can write essays in different languages and it does not have a bond of age.
You can make short films and make them with your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that will inspire you for cleanliness.
It could be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness mission.
Once again I would like to assure you that you should make a pledge to celebrate 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti and that is why the mantra of Swachhta Hi Seva should reach every household from 15th September onwards.
Some steps have been taken for cleanliness.
You must be a part of this effort by yourself.
You see how the theme of Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after the 15-day Swachhata Abhiyan, we will be happy to pay homage to the venerable Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
My dear countrymen, I would like to specially acknowledge our debt.
I express my gratitude to you from the bottom of my heart, not because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time. I would like to express my gratitude to you all for accepting the loan that crores of people of the country are being linked to the people through Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
The more you wait for Mann Ki Baat, the more I wait for your message.
I am eager because I learn something from all of you.
I express my gratitude to all of you for your contribution.
If we are connecting our mobile phones then we become a part of these bad habits.
Prime Minister, I speak Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about my friendship that he always tried to help people but I was tired of seeing this habit.
Once I went to the shopping mall with her.
We make payments without paying any fees at a large place but we try to capitalise on our hardworking brothers and sisters.
Is it not like that we always have a connection with the sellers, small shopkeepers and the sellers of the auto rickshaw vendors, whenever we come to our contact with the hardworking people then we feel comfortable with them.
And we are the ones who go to big hotels to eat or even pay the bill.
For that the question is not of rupees but how much pain will be to their hearts.
And that is why he is a poor person and hence doubts about his honesty that you will not have a difference in your life. But what a big shock you might have thought about your small habit.
I am grateful to you, Madam. You have given me a message by calling a heart touching phone.
I believe that my countrymen will also stop behaving like this with the poor.
My dear young friends, the whole country is celebrating 29th August as National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey is incomparable.
I would like to recall that the new generation of our country should be connected to sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are youngsters in the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical fitness, intellectual principles, emotional collaboration.
I understand what should be more than that
In a way, sports is a boon that connects the heart.
Today, in the era of computerization, I want to tell you that sports is more important than sports stations.
Play FIFA on the computer but show some achievements on the outside ground.
The joy of playing the cricket in the open ground is different from the cricket on the computer.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and mother asked them that you would come home sometimes.
Today the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, they sit in the corner and watch games or cartoon films on their mobile phones, then the mother has to cry out that when you are out
There was a time when you used to say to your mother-children that the time has come for you to go out some time .
Our youngsters are happy that the FIFA U-17 World Cup is being organized from 6-28 October.
Today, when I was talking about sports, the event that touched the heart of the people last week, I would like to tell the people.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl, some of whom were born in the Himalayas.
Whenever 30-30 days were spent in water, this would be the first such incident in the world in the marine waves of the sea.
Who will be an Indian who will not be proud of such daughters
I salute the courage of these daughters and I request them to share this experience with all the countrymen.
I will also provide a different place for their experience on the Narendra Modi App.
Because we must read their experiences because it is a kind of adventure story, it is a story of luxury. And I will be glad that the story of these daughters has been conveyed to you.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
The birth anniversary of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Making our students enjoy creative emotions and knowledge is an important quality of the teacher.
Can we make a solemn pledge when we celebrate Teachers Day
Let each one of us make a solemn pledge for five years, let us show the way to realise it and after five years we can enjoy our lives by enjoying our solemn pledges.
There is such an incident in the life of every teacher that his efforts would have changed somebody's life.
If we make collective efforts, we can play a major role in the transformation of the nation.
I work for the Indian Research Centre at Harvard University in Mumbai.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Economic Survey (PMJDY) is a topic of discussions not only with India but also with scholars from all over the world.
The scheme was launched on 28th August 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the scheme will complete three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been withdrawn.
Today, I am happy that the poor people of the society have been made part of the country's economy.
Now an atmosphere of restraint has been created.
He feels that money will be used for children.
Some good work will be done in the coming days.
Moreover, the poor who looks at RuPay card in his pocket, feels like a rich man, he has a credit card in his pocket, he has a RuPay card in his pocket.
He feels a sense of dignity.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65 thousand crores have been deposited in the bank accounts of the poor.
This is their strength in the coming days and the insurance coverage of those accounts which have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been demonstrated.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana) has given a big confidence to the poor today.
If something happens to the mainstream of the family due to an insurance of one rupee in some families then his family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Today, it is not so much time but I would like to tell the people of the bank to upload it on MyGov.
My dear countrymen, My best wishes to you all again.
Thank you very much.
The human mind is such that it feels very charming in the rainy season.
Animals, birds, plants, nature - all get enjoyed by the arrival of rain.
But sometimes it takes a catastrophic form of rain and then it realizes how powerful it is to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, nourishes us, but sometimes its terrible form of natural calamities like floods, earthquakes etc.
The changes that are taking place in the changing weather conditions and the environment are also having a very negative impact.
Over the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the Armed Forces or the people of the Air Force or the NDRF or the paramilitary forces, all of them are self-reliant in the service of the disaster victims.
Farming, animal husbandry, infrastructure, roads, electricity and connectivity are all the hallmarks of this.
People are also telling about their problems.
Gradually, we can prepare all our work timelines according to the weather forecasts and avoid possible losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing for it more than I am.
On this occasion, I received a lot of letters, a lot of phone calls on GST and people are still expressing joy and satisfaction over GST.
One of these phone calls tells you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I speak from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day address and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST was introduced in our country on the same date last month.
What can we say whether the government had expected the results after one month or not
I would like to hear your views on this thing.
It has been almost a month since GST came into force and its benefits have also started to appear.
I am glad that when a poor person writes to me about how GST has reduced the prices of essential commodities of the poor and how things have become cheaper, I get a lot of satisfaction.
There was a fear in the beginning because the GST was not known, but now it seems that the work seems to be easier than ever before. Somebody from the remote mountains and forests of the gesture had written this letter.
All these facilities are not only available but they are also getting the support for economic momentum.
The speed at which this change has been smoothly brought about, the speed at which it has been transferred, the new registration has created a climate of confidence throughout the country.
Scholars in the field of economics, scholars in the field of management and intellectuals in the field of technology will put India's use of GST in front of the world sometimes as an ideal system.
This is an example for many universities of the world. This will be a hairstyle.
It is a big step to successfully implement this tax in such a vast country with the participation of crores of people.
All decisions have been taken by the states and the Centre in a unanimous manner.
Consequently, every government had prioritized that GST did not put any excess burden on the expenditure on food grains of the poor.
You are very well aware of the fact that the GST App is available on mobile phones for the price of goods and the price of the new situation.
I congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments and all the employees of the central and state government for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of India's collective forces.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a tax reform but a system that strengthens a new honest culture.
In a way, it is also a mission to social reform.
I once again salute crores and crores of Indians for the smooth functioning of such a massive task.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
In a way, several such incidents have taken place in the month of August which are specially related to the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th year of uit India Movement.
However, very few people would be aware of the fact that the slogan 'uit India' is Dr.
Yusuf Meherally.
The new generation should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What could be a bigger inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom.
This movement had prepared the entire country to be freed from the British Raj.
This was the time when against the British Raj, every corner of India, every corner of the country, be it villages or cities or be it education or be it uneducated or be it poor or rich, everybody shoulder to shoulder had become a part of the Chhotu movement.
Responsive to Mahatma Gandhi's call, millions of Indians took the mantra of 'Karo Yaro die' and bowed their lives to the struggle.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and had left their books.
The great personalities like Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan played a key role.
Gandhijis two different forms are seen in both the cooperative movements and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942.
The cooperative movement was different and the situation prevailed in 42 years, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo yields death'.
There was peoples support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all these successes.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that if we look at the leaves of history slightly then India's first war of independence was established in 1857.
This struggle of independence, which began in 1857, continued every moment till 1942 in some part of the country.
This long period has instilled a strong sense of freedom in the hearts of our countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something in that direction.
Generations have changed but solemn pledges have not fallen.
The people came, the people got connected, the people left, the new people came and the country was making every effort to thwart the British rule.
These five years were decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
In 1947, we became independent.
Today the year 2017 is going on.
It has been almost 70 years since that incident.
During this period, the government came and settled.
Arrangements were made, changed, deaf and enhanced.
Everyone tried their best to make the country problem-free.
Efforts have been made to achieve development so that the country gets employment and poverty alleviation.
They also suffered in their own way.
Success has been achieved.
He added that expectations are higher.
For example, from 1942 to 1947, it was five years of resolution.
Similarly, I can see that there is a five year period in the journey from 2017 to 2022.
We should celebrate 15th August, 2017 as a solemn pledge and when we will complete 75 years of our Independence in 2022 then we will fulfil that pledge.
Today, not just the declaration of 'Karenge Ye Marenge' but also to connect with this resolution of a New India, we want to achieve it with a lot of despair and despair.
We want to live up to this solemn pledge, we want to fight.
Let us run a massive campaign from resolution to its realisation on the 9th of August this year.
Every Indian, social institutions, local systems, schools, colleges, different organisations should make some or the other new resolutions for New India.
A solemn pledge that will be fulfilled in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will be part of this solemn solemn pledge and we will certainly be online, whether it is anywhere else.
And that is why I invite my young friends, especially those living in the online world, to come forward to contribute in their innovative ways in building a New India.
Please use technology to bring all the videos, posts, blocks, glasses, innovative themes.
Let this mission become a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be launched for young friends on the NarendraModiApp.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread it on a wide scale.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I am just a time-bound one.
Send your ideas on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I read it by myself and I will try to imagine the time that I get on 15th August.
In the last three years, I have been relentlessly hearing a complaint regarding my speeches on 15th August, that my speech is a little far away.
I will complete it in maximum 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And that economics can never be written less.
Our festivals are not merely an occasion of joy and happiness.
Our festivals are also a medium of social reform.
At the same time, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
Within a few days, festivals like Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganeshotsav, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Diwali will come together and this is the time when the poor people get the opportunity to connect with their economy.
And there is a natural joy in these festivals.
And if we talk about the economy then several months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of families start making Raksha Bandhan through small household industries.
From Khadi to silken furniture, how many types of silks are manufactured and today people have started offering more favourites to the architects of homes and houses.
Thousands and thousands of people associated with this festival are associated with the manufacturers, sellers, sweets and sweets.
It is directly related to those poor families who have made small lamps of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals, I also want to talk about the issue of environment.
And he has urged me to talk about environmental harmony in the context of Ganeshotsav, eco-friendly Ganesh idols in advance so that people can come forward to choose the statue of mud from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to these aware citizens.
He urged me to take this topic beforehand.
This year's Ganesh Utsav has a special significance.
And if I talk about this thing a long time ago then I am sure that you will be associated with this resolution.
And it will provide employment to the poor artisans and poor artists, it will fill the poorest of the poor.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, with the economy of the poor, with the joy of our festivals, with the economic benefits of the houses of the poor, with the joy of economic prosperity.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the many festivals and festivals that will come here.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters showcased their sports in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
It was very good to talk to him, but I realized that he was very proud of the fact that the world teacher did not win.
Their faces were stretched and stressed.
I told him a different analysis of mine.
I said, "Look, today there is a time of fame media that increases expectations.
They are so enhanced that when success is not achieved then that aspiration changes into agitation.
We have seen many such games in which Indias sportspersons lose their anger.
Some people leave their limits and speak such things, write such things that are painful.
But this was the first time that our daughters did not win the world cup but 1. 25 billion Indians took the burden of defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to illuminate the name of our country.
Once again I congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge and every countryman should prepare a roadmap for realising that solemn pledge in the next five years.
Let us move forward together, let us continue to do something.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Weather is changing.
This year's summer was also very hot.
However, the monsoon rains hit us on time and the following is progressing smoothly.
Heavy rains in many parts of the country have a pleasant atmosphere.
After the rains, heavy rains have brought relief from the scorching heat of the past few days.
And you all have seen that whatever kind of rush in life, whatever tensions, be it personal life or public life, the advent of rain changes our mood.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in many parts of the country.
Nowadays in some parts of the world the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are connected with Lord Jagannath ji.
People who are Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has studied that he must have seen that Lord Jagannath ji had a great appreciation of these temples and their traditions because it included social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated with holy reverence.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of blessings .
This is the month of enjoyment and happiness increases as much as you like.
Let us all together take inspiration from these holy festivals and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, an inspiring incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village. In a way, the population of our Muslim families is more there.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
The government also provides assistance for this individual toilet and approximately Rs. 17 lakhs have been disbursed to them.
You can spend Rs. 17 lakhs for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
Each of his stories is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
We are aware that three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, the government and the people of these five states for completing this work.
Then there used to be that ring of the body, of the mind.
The topic of cleanliness is also similar.
These bad habits have become part of our habits.
They have become a part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to pay attention.
We must remind ourselves of good inspirational events.
And I am glad that cleanliness has not been a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of the society and of the common man.
And when the people sitting in the government take this work forward with public participation then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, a wonderful event came to my notice, which I would like to tell you.
This incident is in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration of that place has taken up a massive task with public participation.
100 hours tireless campaign.
And what are the goals
In 100 hours, in 71 Gram Panchayats, toilets were constructed in 10 thousand households.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages were declared ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district. They have set an inspiring example with their hard work.
Prakash Tripathis awareness of democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
Internal awareness is the value of liberation.
Regular awareness about democracy was necessary and therefore he used to recall the attacks on democracy and move forward towards the good things of democracy.
From June 1975-25, it was a dark night that no democratic lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into a youth.
The opponent was pressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Shri Jayprakash Narayan Ji were rushed to the ground.
The system of justice was also not able to escape the terrible shadow of crisis.
Newspapers were made completely unemployed.
The students of todays journalism, the democrats, the people of the world have been repeating the dark period and have been making constant efforts to increase the awareness about democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in Turunga.
When the Emergency was completed one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and he described it in his poems.
My dear countrymen, every Indian has made the world proud today.
21st June, 2017, the entire world became Yoga.
People from sea to mountains welcomed the sun's rays every morning through yoga.
There will be no Indian who would not be proud of it.
Its not like that earlier there was no practice of yoga but today when Yoga has been tied up in the threshold of Yoga then Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world with Yoga.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
People practiced Yoga at The Great Wall of China in China, while at the height of 2400 metres from the sea level in Peru, the world heritage site of Machu-Pichu.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of the iFell Tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different dimension to Indias friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Friendship Dam.
Yoga class was organised along with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters.
Nearly 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad and Gujarat have made a new world record by performing Yoga at once.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I am fortunate to do Yoga asanas during the rainy season.
Our soldiers practiced Yoga in Siachen, where the temperature was 20, 25 and 40 degrees.
Be it our Armed Forces, Border Security Force, ITBP, CRPF, everyone has made Yoga a part of their work.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that for three generations, this is the third International Day of Yoga. Therefore, I had said that I had sent a photograph of three generations of the family as they were doing Yoga together.
Some television channels also took up the issue.
I got a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them have been collected on the NarendraModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit my favourite event.
During the last few years, P.
N.
A good programme is organised by Panikar Prestige and people are observed as reading day and reading month to make people aware about reading books.
I remind you of the fact that I too had come out of my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that we should not give floral cover but we should give a book or welcome it with a handful.
That too is the handloom of Khadi so that Khadi can be promoted.
When I was in Gujarat, I had become the habit of all of us, but after coming here I had lost that habit.
However, he went to Kerala and once again he became aware of the habit.
And now I have started giving suggestions to the lower sections of the government.
We can also gradually develop a habit .
The lives of flower cattle were very low.
Once I took it in my hand and then put it in my hand.
But if the books were made then in a way it would become a part of the house, it would become a part of the family.
When I am talking about this thing then how historical values these things used to be.
Last year when I had gone to England, ueen Elizabeth of Britain had invited me for food in London.
Rani Elizabeth has maintained the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi for so many years.
And when I went, she showed me a lot of happiness.
And when I was looking at it, he had requested me to touch it and see it.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change at all, and whenever they say this thing then vaccine becomes rich.
However, we have to say such things, we have to strive hard.
If I go there and if someone gives me a flower bouquet then I will refuse to give it.
My dear countrymen, as a Prime Minister, there are several types of things.
I have been involved in the files but I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me everyday and that is why I get the opportunity to associate with the common man.
Different types of letters come and write different types of letters.
Recently, I got to read a letter that I would like to tell you about it.
Arulmozhi Saran, a homemaker from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, far away, sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he wrote that he thought of taking some economic initiatives keeping in mind the education of children in his family so that the family could get some financial help.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started working towards supplying goods from the market.
Some people asked me, I have registered it myself and I would like to tell the countrymen that you too should get the opportunity to visit the internet.
GeM is a new kind of system.
Those who want to supply goods to the government, want to sell brooms, want to sell kheer and want to send tables, they can register their names.
All the departments of the government look after those who register under EEGM.
Because of no agents many things are available cheaper .
Arulmozhi Madmony has registered all the items that she can supply on this website of the Government.
And Gammat that the letters he wrote to me are very interesting.
He has written that he got the money under the Mudra scheme, started his business, I had written this list of what can I supply on E-GEM and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what would be the background of the Prime Minister's Office.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arulmozhi didn't write to me, I wouldn't have often noticed that there is a distant domestic leakage in the E-GEM system, its goods can be purchased from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace (GeM)
I want that those who want to sell their goods in this manner should add more and more to it.
I believe that this is a good example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and what is this goal - Minimum Price and Maximum Access, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the uniqueness of India that if our feet are on the ground for Yoga then our dreams are also to cross the horizons of the skies.
A few days ago, India has achieved a lot in the field of sports and science.
Today, India is throwing its address not only on the ground but also on space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 short satellites, including a satellite from Cartosat-2 Malika.
And in addition to India, satellites from around 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and USA were included.
And this Small Satellite Campaign of India will greatly help in the field of agriculture and natural calamities.
A few days ago, you would be aware of the fact that ISRO had successfully launched GSAT-19.
And the satellites that India has so far launched were among the weightyest satellites.
And the newspapers in our country compared it with the weight of an elephant.
You can imagine how our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June, the Mars Expedition was completed in 1000 days.
You all are aware that when we successfully scaled the horizon for the Mars expedition, the entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
He is sending photographs, giving information, getting scientific information, he has been working for more than a fixed life.
On completion of one thousand days, it is a matter of great importance for our space journey for our scientific journey.
At present, we are also seeing that the performance of our youth is improving.
Recently, India's badminton player Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open Games and made the nation proud.
I congratulate him and his coaches on this victory.
A few days ago, I was sworn in by P.
T.
Usha had the opportunity to participate in the inauguration ceremony of Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
The more we encourage sports, the more we promote sports.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
Sports is an extraordinary significance in overall personality development.
There is no shortage of talented athletes in the country.
If the children of your family are interested in sports then they should be given an opportunity.
They should not be inspired to study by lifting them from the field and closing them in the room.
If they can study, they can show their brilliant achievements but if they have the talent and interest in sports, then everybody in schools, colleges, families and surrounding areas should encourage them.
Everyone should have a dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget this year's summer.
However, we are waiting for the rains.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan begins.
On the auspicious occasion of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Prayer , spirituality and charity are given a lot of importance in Ramzan .
We Indians are very fortunate that our ancestors created such traditions and today India can take pride in this thing. We can take pride in the fact that 1. 25 billion Indians are proud of the fact that all the communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and also those who deny God.
There are people who worship idols and are also those who oppose idol worship.
Every kind of thought, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition is here and we have imbibed the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion, sect, ideology or tradition, all these things give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely help in taking this path of peace, unity and harmony forward.
Once again I convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am very happy to say that many people have reacted to it.
Personally, everyone showed me the zeal to talk to you.
I have not been able to read everything, everybody's message has not been heard, so many things have come.
However, some people have tried to learn music according to their vision, some people try to put their hands on new musical instruments, some people try to learn new things by using YouTube and they are learning new languages.
Some people are learning Pakkal, some are learning dance, some are learning drama.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems.
Some people are trying to understand nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I would like to hear a phone call.
"I will speak Diksha Katyal.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle then I realized how much struggle and sacrifices were made to make India free, how many freedom fighters had laid down their lives for years.
I was very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters, about those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
Innumerable great souls spent their youth during the freedom struggle and several youngsters climbed the threshold of a hanging stick.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
You must have seen one thing that the great personalities who had done a great job in the freedom movement, had done a great job in writing and studying the time and their writings also strengthened India's independence.
I had visited Andaman and Nicobar a few years ago.
I had also visited the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book "Majhi Janmathep" in Turunga.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were shut down in small compartments.
How could the freedom fighters have slept.
When I read Savarkar's book 'My Janmadhep', it inspired me to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound light programme which is very inspiring.
There will not be a single state in India, there will not be a single language in India where no one will be able to waste his youth in the Cellular Turunga after the punishment of black money for freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar who speaks every language, every region and every generation.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say - one must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we may not be able to see.
Open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe in the fresh air and get a new consciousness.
When we get in touch with the five great souls that formed our body, a new consciousness and a new energy emerges in our body.
We all are aware of this but we never take care of it. We dont bind it in one thread or in one thread.
Further, you must see that whenever we get in touch with our natural condition, we will have a new consciousness within us.
And that is why the global mission of connecting with nature on June 5 should become our own mission.
Our ancestors protected the environment and we are getting some benefits.
Now if we protect the environment then the future generation will benefit from it.
And atharvaveda is the biggest guiding book of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
It was said to us that Mother Earth: Sons Ahm Prithvi:
The Vedas say that the purity that is in us is due to the earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing can be clearly seen that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana all three events were shattered.
But it needs to be added in modern terms with modern logic.
Through Yoga, we have connected the world to one thread.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intellect and soul, it unites today.
Todays lifestyle, due to swiftness and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
This stressful state of mind has come to an end from a very young age.
In such a scenario, Yoga has an important role to play in leading a stress-free life.
Yoga is a way of ensuring health and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise .
If there is a need to walk in an inter-travel with the health of the body, mind and thought processes then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year, I had announced a few competitions related to Yoga and announced a few prizes.
Gradually the work will progress in that direction.
I have received a suggestion and I congratulate these valuable idea makers.
There is a very interesting suggestion.
He said that this year is the third International Day of Yoga and on that occasion you should urge the three generations of the family to do Yoga together.
Aji-Ajoba, mother-father, son-in-law, three generations should do yoga together and upload their photographs.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be such a beautiful coincidence that will give a new dimension to Yoga.
I am grateful to all of you for suggesting this idea. And I also feel that just as we had started the campaign of selfie through the dustbin and had a very interesting experience, similarly the photographs of the three generations performing Yoga together will be awakened in the country and around the world.
You must send a comprehensive picture of the three generations of people who are performing Yoga on NarendraModiApp and MyGov.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be the photo that will guarantee the golden future.
I invite you.
International Day of Yoga is yet to be completed by 3 weeks.
In a way this immunity is only a movement for health conservation .
I invite all of you to participate in it.
When you gave me the responsibility of your Chief Servant, when I got the opportunity to speak for the first time from the Red Fort on 15th August of my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been able to see that my journey is going on from different parts of India and I have been able to see what Modi is doing, what Modi is going to do and what Modi has done.
This is the reason why I got a lot of telephone calls. And I would have rarely thought of what he said.
But I am grateful to him for taking this into account.
You also listen to this telephone.
Namaskar Modi Ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
Modi, on TV and on social media, I always see that wherever you go, a lot of emphasis is laid on cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission as per your request.
The elders are not only participants but also awareness has come to the children about cleanliness.
Children often get to see elderly people stopping from dirty roads .
The cleanliness drive that you have started from the ghats of Kashi has taken the form of a movement inspired by you people.
You are right to say that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but recently there is a celebration of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before my arrival, a massive cleanliness programme is being organised seven days ago.
Just a few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a massive cleanliness drive.
But I did not know the relation between these two things.
But after the telephone call, I thought that it was true.
You can imagine how pleased I might be by remembering this thing and the country is also taking care of these things in such a small way.
I am glad that the relation of cleanliness is also linked to my visits.
It is not only the habit of preparing for the rest of the Prime Ministers reception but cleanliness has become the key factor in it.
This thing is also joyous and inspiring for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagination is very good but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that this movement should continue and instead of giving gifts to memorials and souvenirs, it is a good thing to get a small amount of waste from the cleanliness drive.
What a great humanity it will be.
Once you have started treating the waste as an asset, many new methods of waste management will come before you.
Youth who are associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and will come up with new instruments.
The Government of India has decided to launch a massive waste management mission with the help of the governments of the states and with the help of the peoples representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities will be able to provide solid waste and liquid waste materials.
Two types of garbage will be provided, one of which will be of green color and the other of blue color.
Two types of wastes are produced - one is wet garbage and the other is dry waste .
These wastes will be kept in 4,000 cities and we should follow the discipline and place dry wastes in blue wastes and wet wastes in green waste.
For example, the waste that comes out of the kitchen includes vegetables, fodder, egg shield, palanquin, all the wet waste and then put it in green waste.
The second kind of waste includes trash paper, litter, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken dung, rubber, metal etc.
I am sure that we will develop such a culture that when we want to take a new step in the direction of cleanliness then we will be able to fulfil the dream of cleanliness that Gandhiji had dreamt of.
Today, I want to mention one thing with pride that even if a single person decides his mind then he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such task.
Versova beach was transformed by the citizens for nearly 80-90 weeks, when thousands of tons of waste was washed away and today Versova beach became clean and beautiful.
Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) had taken up the responsibility of this task.
Brothers and sisters, I have been told that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Reasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become open defecation free.
I congratulate all the citizens of Reasi Block, its administrators and Jammu and Kashmir for setting an example.
And I have been told that the women who lived in that area of Jammu and Kashmir were the frontrunners of this entire movement.
He took out a torch morgue there to create awareness and inspired people to visit homes and streets.
I heartily congratulate those mothers and sisters and congratulate the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir who have started a good start by making a block open defecation free.
My dear countrymen, for the last month and forty-five days, three years of performance of the present government has been audited through newspapers, TV channels, social media.
I consider this process as a very positive sign.
The tenure of these three years has been tested on each and every criterion.
The people of every section of society have analyzed it.
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, some errors have been recorded, somewhere I consider all these things to be important.
I also express my gratitude to those people who have given immunization and important responses.
If we focus on errors and deficiencies then we get an opportunity to improve them.
It is essential for a conscious nation, a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am a common citizen like you and a good White is equally influenced by me as it will be on the minds of an ordinary citizen.
It feels as if I am sitting in the house, sitting in the house, cautioning about the things of the house.
And there are hundreds of such families who have written to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, when I meet you again, there will be rains in every corner of the country, if the weather has changed, if the results of the examinations have changed, the results of the new student life will begin and a new joy and fragrance will come along with the arrival of rains.
Come, let us all move ahead with love for nature in such an environment.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, there is a lot of public contribution to the society, on the other hand, the government is often not being looked at.
Every time all the suggestions received for Mann Ki Baat were discussed in detail in the government.
What are the types of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
It has been found commonly that human beings have a tendency to advise others .
If someone gets a cough in a train or in a bus then the other one comes and asks him to do it.
Advice, suggestions, as if something is in the nature of ourselves.
Most of the suggestions are those people who try to reach out to me, those people who really do something in their lives.
And when they come to know of these things then I realized that these are not ordinary suggestions, these are the words of experience.
Some people make suggestions because they feel that if other people hear the same ideas, where they are working and if they get a comprehensive form then many people can benefit from it.
And that is why he naturally wants to mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat and all these things are very positive in my view.
At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to most of the suggestions made by the employees and those who have done something for the society.
Moreover, whenever I mention something, I feel very happy.
The last time in Mann Ki Baat, some people had suggested to me that food was being wasted, and I had mentioned it.
And when I mentioned about it, several people from every corner of the country used to use it with innovative ideas to avoid wastage of food on NarendraModiApp.
I had never imagined that today, especially the younger generation has been doing this thing for many years.
We have been listening to some social institutions for the past few years, however, I have come to know that the youth of my country are participating in this work.
Many have sent me video.
There are several places where Poles Bank is operating.
People deposit their petals, collect vegetables and take away the needy people from there.
Even those who give satisfaction do not feel humiliated.
This is an example of how the work is being done with the help of the society.
Today is the last day of the month of April.
1st May is the foundation day of the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States have consistently strived to scale new heights of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and their lives continue to inspire us in every sphere of our great societies and in every sphere of our society. Remembering these great souls, we should resolve to take our state, our country, our society, our city and our family to the ground by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence.
We need to make plans to fulfil those resolutions and move forward with the participation of all citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The summer season in May-June in our country has inspired us to experience it in March-April this year.
And when I was asking people's suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions were made during the summer days.
s.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern about the birds.
And I have seen that the small children of the family do this work with interest.
Once they came to know why they had filled the water ten times a day so that they could see if there was water in the utensils kept there or not and they used to see whether the birds had come or not.
We feel that these games are going on but in reality, there is a wonderful experience of awakening this sensitivity in the children's minds.
Sometimes you also see that a little bit of animals and birds gives a new feeling of happiness.
Just a few days ago, Shri Jagat Bhai from Gujarat has sent me a book Save the Sparrows and he has expressed his concern about the reduction in the number of chimneys in it. However, he has made a lot of description in this book about what he himself did for his protection in the form of a campaign.
Though in our country, we have painted our livestock with animals, birds and nature, but it is necessary that these efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had completed 100 years of the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Syedna Saheb.
He lived 103 years.
And on his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a massive campaign to save the wounds from evil.
I had got the opportunity to start it.
He distributed about 52 thousand bird feeders to every corner of the world.
He has secured his place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy with newspapers, milk providers, vegetarians, postmans, somebody comes to our homes but we forget that it is summer days, if we want to ask them why they want water.
Friends, Young friends, I also have something to do with you.
Sometimes I feel that many of our younger generations feel very happy to lead a comfortable life.
Parents are also breeding in a protective situation.
Some others are also of different dimensions, but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the examinations have been completed and there will be plans to enjoy vacations.
Summer vacations, heat, but it feels very good.
But as a friend, I have to say something about how to leave you.
I am sure some people will do experiments.
If you use this vacation and I offer three proposals then it is very good if you do three of them but try to do one of the three things.
New space, new experience, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on television or reading it in books or listening to acquaintances and feeling it yourself , there is a difference of respect in both .
Experiments should be positive and comfortable.
We are from middle class families and from happy families.
If you ever feel like this then do it again and do it again.
In the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or take any sports literature to the poorest of the poor.
Play with those poor kids and you will find that you have never enjoyed sports in your life before.
Whenever you people will get the opportunity to play with you, you have thought that how a big change will be brought about in their lives.
And I believe that once you visit, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organisations are serving.
At times there are several summer camps .
Personality is of development, it is of various kinds of development, it can participate in it.
But at the same time, you feel that you have scored such a scorching heat, you have practiced individuality development and you should reach out to those people who have not got the opportunity to learn and learn those who have been taught you.
You can teach them how to do it.
I was also worried about the fact that technology came to minimize the gap and technology came to an end.
Everybody has become engrossed in technology on the other.
Today is an era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot of people in life is a good thing, it is a good idea to do something and to do it.
But also look at the fact that the human beings within us are not bitter, we are not far away from human qualities.
Can we focus a little on this aspect in skill development
Efforts are made to spend time with yourself away from technology.
A musical instruction, a new language of 5-50 verses, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi.
And if we look closely at the country that is full of diversity then we will find no learner around us.
If you can't swim, you can learn swimming, you can't draw pictures.
The sensitivity within you will be manifested.
Sometimes we used to learn small things that we call them - why not want them.
You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that you will be happy and you will be able to get out of the boundaries of your life.
Friends, Do something outside Chakori.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you are wondering if all the exams are over, if you learn at a new juncture then that opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you have the verse to learn magic then learn the magic of the letters.
Let us show our friends magic.
Try to know something or the other that you don't know, it will definitely benefit you.
Your inner manpower will get a consciousness and a great opportunity for development.
I can tell from my experience that we cannot imagine how much we learn from looking at the world.
New places, new cities, new towns, new towns, new villages and new complexes.
I will be staying at one place for three days and four days.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days and four days.
This will teach you a lot.
When you visit me, you must send me photographs there.
Have you seen a new one
Where do you go
You can share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the government of India has given you a lot of opportunity.
The new generation is almost getting rid of cash transactions.
You can also do it but you can also earn through this scheme- you have thought.
It is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you are downloading the BHIM App, you are also using it.
10 rupees will be deposited in your accounts by the government.
If you get 20 people a day then you can earn 200 rupees by evening .
Businessmen can also earn, students can also earn.
And this scheme is up to 14th October.
You will contribute in creating a Digital India.
In a way, it was a symbol of VIP culture but the experience used to tell that the red light was on the vehicle, it was on the train, but gradually the VIP culture was in the brain.
Now the red light is gone and no one can claim that the red light that has entered the brain will come out.
I got an interesting telephone call.
He has also expressed confidence in this telephone, but this time, this telephone shows that the common man does not like these things.
He feels a kind of insanity in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I read an illumination in the newspaper, in which I was very proud to hear the ever Indians a VIP on a road. And I was happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't have to stop in traffic jams and I don't have to stop for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision.
Going to red light through government decisions is a part of the system.
However, we have to remove it from our minds with all our efforts.
If we all make conscious efforts together then we can find out.
Our concept of New India is to increase the importance of EPI in place of VIP in the country and when I say EPI in place of VIP, my feelings are clear: Ever Person is Important.
Every individual has the importance, every individual has the knowledge.
If we accept the significance of 1. 25 billion Indians, if we accept the significance of 1.
We all have to come together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we should remind ourselves of history, our culture and our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 1,000th birth anniversary of 125 crore countrymen Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
For some reason, we were so stunned, we were so small that we kept thinking for centuries.
For other countries around the world, centuries will be of immense importance.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to remember thousands of years and thousands of years ago, what was the society of one thousand years ago
Just imagine.
Even today, if we talk about social customs then how difficult it is.
How it would have happened a thousand years ago
He himself made the society untouchables by his own conduct.
Thousands of years ago, he had organized a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate that in every era great societies have been born to eradicate the evils of our society.
While we are celebrating one thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya, we should inspire him to inspire this feeling of social unity and unity.
The Government of India will also publish a Postage Stamp on 1st May to commemorate Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
I bow down to Saint Shri Ramanujacharya Ji and pay my respects.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow's 1st May is another significance.
It is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And it is natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar whenever there is a talk of labour and labour.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the benefits received by the workers today.
Babasahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, when I talk about Saint Shri Ramanujacharya Ji, I also remember Guru Basveshwarji in the world of great saints and social reformers of Karnataka in the 12th century.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to attend a function.
The programme was to dedicate his Commentary Collection to the nation.
In Kannada, he had said - Kay Kave Kailas means that you can achieve the welfare of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
I used to talk about Shramayi Jayate again and again.
Today, when we talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Thengadi after a couple of days.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha throughout the world celebrate the festival.
Buddha's ideas are very relevant when the world is facing such problems, when it comes to violence, wars, destruction and arms competition.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate to be celebrating Vesak Day on behalf of the United Nations on this great occasion of Buddha Purnima.
This year, it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
They will get an opportunity to illuminate their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
On 5th May, India will launch South Asia Satellite.
The capacity and associated facilities of the satellite will be extremely helpful in fulfilling South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
This is a useful example of our commitment towards South Asia.
A large number of families in most parts of the country will be engaging in the examinations of their children.
Those who have been tested, there will be some stress-free environment in those houses where the examinations are still underway, there will be slight stress.
However, I would like to say this thing that the last time I had told the students about Mann Ki Baat, I would like to hear it again.
These things will definitely be useful for us during the examinations.
Today is 26th March .
26 March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic war against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the bang-brothers.
Today, on this important day, I convey my best wishes to the people of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day. And I would like to assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a cooperative partner of Bangladesh.
It is a good friend and we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in the entire region by shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory is a shared heritage.
This is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but the British had also given him the "Nighthood" title.
Rabindranath Tagore was one of those great men who had raised their voice against this incident when the British killed a large number of civilians in the Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
This was the same period when a child of 12 years of age had a remarkable impact on this incident.
The brutal massacre in the garden of Jallianwala had inspired a child laughing in the fields of the juvenile age.
In 1919, the child of the age of 12, that is, the son of all of us, the son of all of us, Shahid Bhagat Singh, the inspiration for all of us.
Three days before today, on the 23rd of March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh ji, his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru and we all know about that incident on 23rd March.
On the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, the service of Mother India was satisfying and there was no fear of death.
He sacrificed his life's dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three bravehearts are still an inspiration for us.
The words of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be embellished.
I got the opportunity to visit that place a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit that place and I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to visit Punjab then we must visit the tomb of Bhagsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagsingh ji's Matoshree and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the spirit of freedom and its intensity were increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for an armed revolution.
So just a hundred years ago, on April 10, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had done the Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian styles were reflected on the occasion of Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of freedom struggle, especially in the face of struggle.
This was the time when Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the end of the mill workers in Ahmedabad and the depths of Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and style of functioning were visible.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Gandhiji in our minds today.
Imagine a person returns to India in 1915 and a tenure of only two years.
The country was not acquainted with them, its not even their influence, it was just the beginning.
You can imagine how hard they had to suffer and how hard they had to work.
Champaran Satyagraha was an event in which the organisational skills of Mahatma Gandhi, the power of recognizing the pulse of Mahatma Gandhi's Indian society, the organisation of Mahatma Gandhi's teachings against the British Raj to organise, motivate, motivate and bring him to the ground to fight and thus we experience Mahatma Gandhi's universality.
We can learn from them. And it was the time when we heard the names of the great leaders, whether it was Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani who had sent them to the fields.
And the British did not know what was the method of Gandhiji's work, there was a struggle and there was a new generation.
One side was the struggle and the other was the creation.
On the one hand, the sentence was to be passed on and on the other hand it was to be devoted to constructive work.
This is the desire to transform the 125 crore Indians, this is the reason that the foundation stone of New India will be laid.
New India is not a government programme or a declaration of a political party.
New India is an appeal to 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are several people who go to the hospitals, serve the patients and those who run for blood donation whenever they need it.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry people.
Our country is blessed with abundance.
Service to the people is inherent in our nerves.
If we look at it collectively and collectively then it is a great force.
If every citizen has taken a pledge that I will follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides to fulfill his responsibilities honestly, if every citizen decides that I will not use petrol diesel one day in a week.
You will see that the dream of this country, the dream of a New India and 1. 25 billion Indians will be fulfilled in their eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his citizen's religion and follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude today.
Over the past few days, there has been such an environment in our country that people have participated in the digital payments and digital movement in a big way.
After demonetization, there has been an increase in the number of digital payments.
It has been only two-and-a-half months since the launch of BHIM App, however, nearly 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, we have to take the fight against black money and corruption forward.
25 billion Indians will make a solemn pledge to make 2. 5 billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
25 billion Indians do not have to wait for a year if they do this thing in mind.
This will be done in six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions, if you fill school fees, if you dont fill in cash or digitally fill it up, you will make digital payments in rail travel and in air travel.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several digitization fairs have been organized for public education and public awareness.
There is a pledge of 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programs have been organized .
There were twenty-five schemes in it.
About 12. 5 lakh people have got the benefit of Lucky Consumer Scheme.
70 thousand traders have earned their blessings .
On the completion of 100 days, a mega event will be held at the end of the day.
It has a system of big solutions.
I believe that we will spread the BHIM App in the number of days that are still in our hands for the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
We should also participate in the reduction in cash, reduction in the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to say that every time I ask the people for the Mann Ki Baat, there are several different kinds of suggestions but I have seen that every time there is information about cleanliness.
Honble Prime Minister, my greetings, first of all, I congratulate you that you have won a large number of votes in these elections.
I want to tell you something in my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness themselves.
Everyday I pass through that river where most people pollute the river by putting garbage in large quantities.
This river flows from the Rispana bridge to my home.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to the fore through a group or a New Paper.
Brothers and sisters, Look how much trouble a girl learns in the untimely manner.
How much anger has come to him by looking at the garbage in the river .
I consider it a good sign.
And this is what I want that the 125 crore Indians should be disdainful about dirtiness.
Since the start of the Swachhta movement, there has been awareness among the people.
Everyone has been connected in a positive way.
Now this mission has taken the form of a movement.
There is growing disgust over filth.
There is a different significance in creating awareness, enhancing active participation.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than movements.
This movement is a movement to change habits and is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This can be a collective movement.
The work is difficult but we have to do it.
I am confident that the spirit that has been awakened among the new generation, children, students and youth of the country will automatically be an indicator of the good results.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell the people of the country that the message of Gayatri should be the message of each one of us.
Have we ever imagined how much disadvantage is being done in the food that we feed on.
Have you ever imagined that this kind of salt has not been wasted or how many poor people can get filled in their stomachs
This is not a topic that needs to be explained.
When the food of the mother-child grows in her house then she used to say that the child is as much as he wants.
Some efforts are being made but the disappointment about this is a social treason.
This is an injustice to the poor.
The second issue is that if savings are made then the family will get financial benefits.
I dont have to say much about it but I feel that awareness should increase.
Some youngsters are aware of me who run such a campaign.
They have created a mobile app.
Where such food is wasted or swallowed, they talk to other people and use it juice.
The youth of our country is doing this hard work.
You will find such people in every state of India.
Their life inspires us not to waste food, increase food as much as you want.
Look, there are ways to change , those people who are aware of health often say that they keep their stomach a little empty .
I would like to tell the countrymen that sadness is not an incurable problem.
One has to create a psychological environment and then treatment starts .
The first mantra is that instead of suppressing sadness, it becomes open.
Tell our colleagues, friends, parents, feelings and teachers openly what happens to you.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness occurs more in students living in hostels .
They don't come in the food table.
Have we ever noticed why he does this
We know that this is the first step towards sadness.
If he avoids staying with his family and goes alone then pay attention to this thing that it will not happen .
Look at the people with whom he talks openly.
Please inspire him to become a man of laughter and unlock him where he is in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can become the cause of psychological and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all diseases, similarly it attacks the ability to fight, to dare, to decide and destroys this capability.
Your friends, your family and your environment can keep you away from getting sad and if you are sad then you can also get out of that mood.
There is one more solution.
If we are not able to open our neighbours, do one thing, go to a place where the work is being done with the help of service.
If we try to understand their grief with utmost care then we will have a new confidence in our minds.
By serving someone and serving one another with selflessness the stress of mind becomes easier.
By the way , yoga is also a good way of keeping the mind healthy .
Yoga is very useful for getting rid of tension, getting rid of stress, getting rid of stress and cheerfulness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Prepare yourself from now on and celebrate mass yoga festivals in the number of lakhs.
If you want to make some suggestions on Yoga Day then you can reach out to me through my mobile application.
We can compose songs and poems on Yoga so that the subject can be easily accessible to the people.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in the last few days.
It is indeed a welcome fact that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He takes over the responsibility of the family, he also takes over the financial responsibility of the household, which sometimes causes injustice to the newborn babies.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
The maternal mortality rate that was earlier available for 12 weeks during pregnancy to those working women will now be given 26 weeks.
Two or three countries are ahead of us in this regard.
India has taken an important decision for these sisters.
Its basic aim is to take care of the newborn child who is the future citizen of India.
If she was taken care of in a childhood, if she got the affection of her mother then tomorrow this child will be the glory of the country.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence the benefits of this important decision will reach about 18 lakh women.
Let us draw inspiration from the lives of these great souls and get the strength to make a solemn pledge for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukal Pratipada, New Sanvatsar, greetings for the New Year.
It is time for the farmers to start preparing the crops after the spring season and the fruits of their hard work .
The New Year is welcomed in different ways in different parts of our country.
In Maharashtra, Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Sanatsar Puja in Awadh province, Jud-Shital in Mithila region of Bihar and Satwani in Magadh region are welcomed.
India is a country full of innumerable diversity.
My best wishes to you all for this New Year.
Thanks a lot.
Winter is over now.
The spring season has entered the lives of all of us.
The thorny splendor of summer seasonal fruits of mango is seen in the spring itself .
At the same time, potato yellow flowers in the fields renew the hearts of the farmers.
The swollen blossoms of lips indicate the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khusro has given a very interesting description of this moment of change in nature.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Phul Rahi Sarson became gross, Ambawa Foot, Tesu Phule, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
When nature is happy, when the environment is happy, man also enjoys this season.
The festivals of Spring Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi fill human lives with joy.
In an atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity, we will leave Falgun this last month and we are ready to welcome the upcoming Chaitra month.
The spring season is a confluence of two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for your suggestions and suggestions before Mann Ki Baat then I get a lot of suggestions.
We are grateful to him for recalling this pride of India.
Whether it is poverty alleviation, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, knowledge and information technology has highlighted our importance.
15 February 2017 is a glorious day in the life of India.
Our scientists have raised India's forehead before the world and we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several missions in the last few years.
In the last few days, ISRO has set a global record in the space sector, after a successful launch of Mars under Mars Mission.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for the entire country.
ISROs Cost Effective Efficient Space Programme is a wonder for the entire world and the world has also appreciated this success of Indian scientists with an open heart.
Brothers and sisters, Cartosat-2D is one of the most important satellites of these 104 satellites. It is India's satellite and will be used for the photographs, mapping, infrastructure development facilities, information about development and urban development planning.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water resources are available in the country, how can they be utilized
It is also a matter of happiness for us that our young scientists , our women scientists have led this campaign .
This massive participation of youth and women is a testimony to the pride of ISROs success.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I congratulate ISRO scientists.
These scientists have maintained the aim of using space science for the service of the common man and the nation and are recording new records.
No matter how much we congratulate these scientists and their teams , they will be less .
Indian scientists have done this.
The capability of this missile is that even if a missile arrives to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometers, this missile will destroy it in space.
When we look for new technologies, we find a new scientific exploration.
Those who don't get the same answer don't get healthy.
And when we observe the journey of human energies for thousands of years, we can say that this journey of development is not complete anywhere.
New sciences, new technologies emerge from it and every technology, every form of new science, every new age emerges.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs many scientists.
Todays scientific community can be a sustainable change in the lives of generations to come.
A few days ago, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a major competition on the occasion of 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful discoveries were invited.
Sometimes the problem underscores the importance of science in finding answers.
In Mumbai, there was heavy rainfall in 2005, Mahapur came, there were sea shores and there were many hurdles.
Whenever there is any natural calamity then the most observed problem is that of the poor.
Both of them worked with utmost diligence and developed a system of home-building which will save the lives of people living at home in times of adversity, save the water from coming home and save the diseases arising due to polluted water.
Mechanisms are also being driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
There has been an increase in emphasis on DG-Dhan in the last few days.
Especially the younger generation is habituated to making digital payments through their mobile phones.
I believe that this is a good sign.
Fortunate Consumer Scheme and Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana have received good support in the last few days in our country.
About two months ago, every day 15 thousand people are getting Rs.
Through these two schemes, India has welcomed the goal of making digital payments a mass movement across the country.
It is a matter of happiness that today 10 lakh people have been awarded under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have received prizes and this great work has been done in the form of more than Rs.
There are more than 100 subscribers in this scheme who have received Rs. 1 lakh each in the form of prize money.
There are four thousand traders who have received fifty-five thousand rupees and twenty-five rupees.
Shri Santosh from Mysore, while expressing his happiness, wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a thousand rupees prize in the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I believe that he has written an important thing and it should reach you.
He has written that when he received a thousand rupees, he realized that a poor woman's house was set on fire and all the goods were burnt in that fire.
Santosh ji, our innovation and our work are satisfying us all.
You have done a very inspiring job.
Twenty-two year old Bhai Sabir, who was now associated with digital transactions after the demonetization, got a turnover of one lakh rupees in the lucky consumer scheme of the government.
Pooja Nemade, a young student from Maharashtra who is doing Post Graduate Courses, is also extending the experience of using RuPay cards, e-wallets to his family and how much enjoyment he is doing.
One lakh rupees are so important for him, but he has taken up this work as a force and has also associated others with it.
This movement has a very important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Anti-corruption cadre and anti-corruption team are associated with this work in my view.
In a way, you are a soldier of beauty.
On April 14, a huge discount of Rs.
There are about forty-four days more scavengers.
Remembering him, we should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Learn about how it was exchanged.
Especially teach the small and retail traders around us.
Give special importance to Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and Bhim App on this occasion.
And that is why I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The BHIM App is going to reach every household, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody and everybody.
The movement that has started in the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in several urban areas, several sports and several cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has contributed immensely to the roots of our economy.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today, I would like to tell you something very happy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill up the grain warehouses.
The hardships of our farmers have resulted in record production this year.
All the records tell us that our farmers have made the records of the past.
This year there has been such a crop in the fields that everyday it feels that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is more than eight yards above the previous record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented success in itself.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
I also thank you for considering the traditional crops as well as the poor of the country for producing pulses because the poorest of the protein gets the maximum protein from pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country listened to the voice of the poor and planted various pulses on the ground of about two hundred and fifty lakh hectares.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
I have a request, a prayer is that my farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for the way my farmers have tried to snatch and produce record pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, from the government, from the society, from the institutions, from organizations, from everyone, some initiatives are going on in terms of cleanliness.
In a way everyone is seen to be aware about cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government is also making constant efforts.
A few days ago, under the leadership of our Secretaries, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana under the leadership of their Secretary, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India.
What is the significance of direct hygiene in Telanganas Warangal
Toilet Pitting Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February using it .
The toilet pits of six houses were empty and cleaned and most of the households showed themselves that the toilets used by the Twin Pit toilet can be used again empty.
He also showed how convenient the toilets constructed using this new technology are and there is no difficulty in terms of cleanliness while opening them and mental obstacles are also not obstructed.
Just as we clean others, we can clean a toilet.
And if we consider it as a fertilizer then in a way it has black gold.
We can see how West to Wealth produces wealth from waste and it has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for a family of six people, this model fills in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and disposed off into another pothole.
In six to twelve months, waste collected waste was disintegrated.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium are rich in nutrients and are considered to be the best fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken the initiative.
Now a special programme of Swachhta Bidding has been started on Doordarshan.
The more it spreads, the more it will benefit.
Several departments of the government regularly organise Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the second fortnight of March, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy and self-confidence increases.
We welcomed the performance of our disabled sportspersons in the Rio Paralympics.
The nation is proud of the success of these Divyang friends.
I often believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every moment we can learn something or the other from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or of space science, women of our country are not behind anybody.
Our womens team won the silver medal in the Asian Rugby Sevens trophy just a few days ago.
I convey my best wishes to all these players.
Womens Day is celebrated in the world on March 8th.
In India too, there should be greater awareness and sensitivity in the family and the society towards giving importance to the girl child.
The campaign of 'Save Moolgi-Learning' is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme.
Today it has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been linked to this initiative.
This initiative has contributed to thinking about this vivid issue in every corner of the country.
The old customs that have been going on for years have changed the thinking of the people.
When we get the news that the festival was celebrated after the birth of a daughter, it gives us great pleasure.
In a way positive thoughts about girls are causing social acceptance.
I have heard that Kundlore district in the state of Tamil Nadu has arrested child marriage on priority under a special mission.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been linked with the 'Save the Organic Learning' scheme, a lot of effort is being made by the district administration to ensure that the orphan girls get their education along with the organisation of Gram Sabhas.
In Madhya Pradesh, the education drive for every household knock is going on in rural areas.
In Rajasthan, a campaign called Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya is being run to inspire school dropout girls to come back to school.
New ideas are being associated with it.
It has changed according to local needs.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling- "Women, who are the women of India, who are the women of India, who are the women of India, who are not the workers, who are the officers of all of us. "My dear countrymen, we all get an opportunity to talk about something in Mann Ki Baat.
We too would have been actively involved.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
This festival, which reminds us of the Constitution of India, the duties of our citizens, the rights of our citizens and our commitment to democracy, is a festival that will create awareness on the future generations about the responsibility of fulfilling democracy.
However, the more we discuss the rights and duties of the citizens in our country, the more we talk about them, the more we talk about them, the more we talk about them.
I hope that at every level, the more important the rights are given to them, the more important duties are to be given.
On this day, at 11 a.m. we pay our homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by taking a two-minute silence.
On 30th January, at 11 o'clock, we should be able to understand the silence of two minutes as a society, as a country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of the brave soldiers who have been awarded various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal etc.
I particularly urge the youth of the country that you are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing, the heroes who have received this honour at this time find out on the internet and write about them two good words and send them to their friends.
When we go deeply to know about the courage, valour and valour of these heroes, we feel proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the news of 26th January being celebrated with fervour and at the same time, the soldiers in Kashmir lost their lives due to the heavy snowfall in protecting the borders of our country.
I salute and pay my respects to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are aware of the fact that I keep telling you your Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March and April is the month of great sacrifice for every family.
Almost every household has one or two kids' examinations but all the families were buried under the guise of that exam.
At that time it would be appropriate to interact with my student friends, their parents and teachers because the examination of children in those places where I visit them for many years has become a cause of great concern.
A very strange mental situation is being created in every household that the family is worried, the students are worried, the teachers are in detail.
When I was going to talk about this thing then several teachers, parents, students sent me a message, sent a message, sent some suggestions, the problems and difficulties faced by you people were also mentioned.
I would like to share with you all the thoughts that came to my mind after reading them.
I received a telephone message from the universe.
Sir, I would like to tell you that during the days of exams, our families, our neighbours and our societies had a very terrible environment.
It is not possible that the minds of the students get reinforced but we become sad.
I would like to ask you that this environment cannot be happy.
Though the question is created, it will swell in our hearts.
There are very few people who appear in the examination.
For most of the people, there used to be a pressurrection.
It is a true expression that you have to decide on the pleasure only.
The pleasure, pleasure and joy that will be faced in this exam will get the same results and it will be a matter of repentance for the person who will be punished.
And that is why I believe that you should face exams as if something is just a festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play their role in fulfilling this festival with enthusiasm.
Looking at this, the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, all the examinations are conducted in these three to four months.
These three-four months should be changed in accordance with their traditions and in accordance with the environment of their families during the festival.
And that is why I would like to tell you, Smile More, Score More.
In a stressful state of mind, all the doors are closed, no one can go out and no one can come out.
The thought process ceases and these things get overwhelmed.
And where is it that you dont have knowledge, lack of information, lack of hard work
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge and your information gets squeezed.
A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we don't look at the exams from the right perspective.
It is our mentality that we may have a question of life and death.
This test will be conducted only about what you have done throughout the year.
Your entire life will not be required there.
This is not an examination of how many lives you have lived, how you are living and how you have lived your life ahead.
Apart from the examinations conducted in classrooms and widespread books, you must have visited several other cases.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 3, 2018).
J.
The greatest challenge I can see in todays era is education centre.
Marks are getting a lot of importance .
This has not only increased the competition but has also increased the stress on the minds of the students.
I want to know your ideas about the present trend of education and its future.
However, he has answered in his own question but his wish is that I should share some of my views on this subject.
There is a limited use of quality and chromosome.
If you believe in these things then you will be left behind from us. You will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to utilize your knowledge in life, you will be able to use your resources, you will be able to use your self-confidence and determination.
When you go to a lawyer to fight a big challenge, do you see its mark sheet
A successful journey in the field of knowledge and skills can be seen there.
That is why the attack of Markanch sometimes stops us from moving in the right direction.
Rutcha ji has also raised the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a very big mental battle.
I would like to say that it is easy to understand the examples related to sports.
Most of the successful sportspersons have a unique feature of their own competition.
Let us take this example by Sachin Tendulkar.
His journey has been to know about his own records for twenty years and to be able to move ahead by defeating himself.
It should be amazing because they themselves pursue competition rather than compete with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you should ask yourself about the same thing that I could study quietly for the first two hours, should I study for three hours now
Wake up early in the morning, should we wake up early
You don't have to sleep beforehand because of the stress of the examination.
He added, My mother was not much educated.
Yet she used to sit with me and switch off maths from me.
I would like to tell the parents that they should focus on three things: accept acceptance, teaching and giving time.
Parents must have experienced that their expectations from the children of teachers are at the root of many problems.
Your load will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask any questions related to the health of that patient.
He came and started listening to Vinodi jokes.
In four to five minutes, the entire atmosphere was swept away.
The patient of A . . . keeps on talking about the disease going to meet him .
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we are communicating with the children.
Have we ever thought that we should provide an environment of happiness, smile and happiness to the children during the examination
Do it, the environment will change.
I have received another big phone call from Kamli.
He said, Namaskar Prime Minister, I cannot name myself because I did the job of my childhood.
I had tried to copy once when I was a child.
And when I tried to copy it directly, I was caught in that too, because of this my friends around me had a lot of trouble.
These hard-cut roads become reasons for copying.
You must have heard it many times.
I will say the same thing again.
In any way the ill effects of copying will be seen .
If the same creativity spends the same time on the examination issue then perhaps there is no need to copy.
I have received a telephone call saying, "Namaskar Prime Minister, my name is Monica and I am a 12th student, so I want to ask you a few questions related to board examinations.
My first question is about the increasing tension during these tests, how can we reduce it
When I talk about sports during the exams, your teachers and your parents will stay on me.
He said that how Prime Ministers are the ones who instruct children to play during the exams.
Because we generally understand that sports is getting less focused on studies.
This thinking is fundamentally wrong.
The problem is the original one.
You should come out of your studies and watch the sky for two moments, look at the trees around you, make your mind lighter and then sit in your room to study.
Why not give this rest to yourself for five minutes .
You will be able to see that the work was going on even more.
Whether everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me this only.
For that there is no need to sit in the room.
Stand under an open devotion, go to Gachchi, breathe for five minutes and then study.
Some people think that if you wake up late at night then you will get a lot of studies .
But it is not.
Definitely take as much sleep as is needed by the body .
Your overall efficiency will increase.
When I go for election campaigns, sometimes my voice comes up.
At one such meeting, I had come to meet a folk singer.
He asked me, How many hours did you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously .
However, the people of your house will live up to me.
It is a very beneficial medicine to keep mind , mind , body aware .
Friends, You are engaged in the preparation of the exams and I have stuck in my mind.
Maybe this word of mine will help you to overcome the stress of your mind.
But at the same time, I would also like to say that do not take care of the things I have told you.
If you want to assemble then do it or not, otherwise it will become a burden.
Don't put the burden of expectations on the children. This is what I have told your parents.
Let the tests be faced with your determination, with your self-confidence.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross each boundary, give it the form of festival itself.
There will be no exam.
You must move ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
Indian Coast Guard (ICG) along with 126 self-made vessels and 62 aircraft is the fourth largest coast Guard in the world.
The Coast Guard personnel are eager to protect the maritime boundaries and maritime territories of the country by marine passages in accordance with their ideals.
Last year, the people of Coast Guard took pride in making our country's sea shores clean with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in it.
He deserves compliments for taking care of the cleanliness of the beaches along with the safety of the beaches.
Very few people would be aware that the Coast Guard of our country is not only a man but also a woman who is fulfilling her responsibilities with the same kind of dedication and is successfully fulfilling her responsibilities.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard are aeronautical, observers, handling over the responsibility of the hovercraft.
Today, on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard to keep Indias coastline safe, while on the global stage of coastal security, I would like to congratulate the Indian Coast Guard.
Spring Panchami will be celebrated on 1st February.
It is considered to be the beginning of the school.
Not only this, this time is also an inspiration for the heroes.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola shows the same inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Vasudhai Panchami.
My dear countrymen, while spreading Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio is also adding new color to it with its innovation.
Mann Ki Baat provides a great opportunity to connect with you.
Many congratulations.
My dear countrymen, greetings and best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that if the poor do not receive our favor then we want to accept it.
St. Luke has written in the Gaspel that it is not only serving the poor but also appreciating the service done by the poor and in true sense it is empowerment.
A story related to it is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasure of a temple .
Many wealthy people came and donated a lot.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and placed two copper coins in it.
Now when we went to see what was the value of two copper coins
The devotees standing there were surprised.
Yesso said that the widow has donated the most, and the others have done a lot, but this woman has donated everything she has.
Just two days ago, in Varanasi, where Malviya ji's penance land, I got the opportunity to launch several development projects.
I laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in Varanasi.
Today is the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
We will never forget the contributions made by Atal ji.
Under his leadership, the country's pride in the field of nuclear energy has also been lifted.
Whether it is a party leader, a member of parliament, a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has set an ideal in every field.
I bow to Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray for his good health.
As a worker, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awake today in front of my eyes.
When I tweeted this morning, I shared an old picture of how Atal ji's affection is beneficial as a small worker.
Today, on Christmas Day, the citizens of the country will be benefitted by two schemes.
In a way, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn and understand from each other.
In order to give a boost to this, the Central Governments Incentive Scheme for Consumers and Small Businesses is being launched from today to make the process a habit of e-payment so as to strengthen the mobile banking system.
Lucky Grahak Yojana (LGSY) is a customer friendly scheme and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana (DDVY) is a big boost to traders.
The scheme will start from today and will continue for the next 100 days.
Every day 15,000 people will get Rs. 1000 per day.
In addition to this, there will be a huge discount of one day from week to day for such customers who will be given a discount of Rs.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there will be a big combination in which crores of rupees will be distributed.
Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is primarily for the traders.
Businessmen should themselves participate in the scheme and also include customers for cashless transactions.
These traders will also be given free loans and this amount will also be in thousands.
Businessmen will continue to do their own business and they will also get an opportunity to win Bakshis.
The scheme has been formulated keeping all sections of the society, particularly the poor and the lower middle class citizens at the centre.
3,000 will not avail the benefits of these discounts.
The poorest of the poor can also purchase goods using USSDs through phones or simple phones, sell goods, deliver money and all of them can be beneficiaries of this Buxar scheme.
Rural areas can also be purchased and sold through AEPS.
30 crore people will soon be able to participate in the BRICS scheme.
It is very simple. The easier we send messages from WhatsApp.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that awareness about how technology should be used in our country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments is increasing at a fast pace.
Cashless transactions have increased by 200-300 in the past few days.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision to promote this.
The traders will be able to guess how big this decision is.
Income tax exemption has been granted to traders who will facilitate online payment of cash in their business by way of digital transactions.
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
A committee has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes on their own and have started implementing them.
Somebody told me that the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 percent concession in respect of property tax and trade licence fee through digital mode.
The branches of Grameen Banks, which will make at least two digital transactions between January and March, will get Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
5 lakh under Good Panchayats for Digital Transactions by Government of India upto 31st March, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced an outlay of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who have been fully digitally filled up for procurement of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Farmer Shiromani Scheme for the farmers.
I congratulate the government of Assam and all those who have taken up this kind of initiative.
Several organisations have made several successful experiments to promote digital transactions among poor farmers in the villages.
Someone told me that the companies related to Gujarat Narmada Khore, Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited have installed POS machines for the benefit of farmers where fertilizers are sold, in just a few days, about 35,000 farmers have purchased 5 lakh fertilizers through digital means and all this has happened in just two weeks.
It is a matter of fact that the fertilizer sales of the company increased by 27 this year as compared to the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, We are aware that the scope of the informal sector has increased in our economy and in our life system and most of the people are given wages, money or wages with cash and the wages with which the labour is being exploited.
And if you want to get 100 rupees then you will get 80 rupees.
At the same time, they are also empowering other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country in the world.
Technology is our easy accomplishment.
Countries like India must be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made great strides in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of the digital movement.
Our youth can empower this sector with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, we should all strive hard to make the country free from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I urge people to give their suggestions before Mann Ki Baat.
80-90 per cent of the suggestions made on MyGov and Narendra Modi App are related to fight against corruption and black money.
Whenever I saw all these things, I had divided them into three parts with a lot of enthusiasm.
Some people have written in detail about the suggestions given to me about the difficulties faced by the citizens and irregularities.
The other kind of people have written about the good work done for the welfare of the country, however, this kind of sacred work is being done for the welfare of the country and how the new ways of fraud and misbehavior are being pursued.
Third kind of people have written that this fight should continue in support of what has happened.
The number of citizens who insist that corruption and black money should be completely eradicated and strict action should be taken if necessary.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen who have helped me by sending me such letters.
Shri Gurumani Kewal has said that this step taken to completely curb black money transactions is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money just like the army forces.
Many rumours have spread that the words written on the notes are wrong, the rate of sweets has increased, the amount of notes of two thousand rupees will be cancelled, and the amount of rupees 500 and 100 will be cancelled.
But the people of this country were restrained by the rumours of this country.
Not only this, many people came to the ground, they used their skills and wisdom to bring the true faces of those who spread rumours, they proved the rumours to be wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
I salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with us, nothing is impossible.
Janta Jardan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for the enthusiastic participation of the people of the country in this great struggle for corruption and black money.
I wanted to have wide-ranging discussions in the House regarding the ongoing fight against corruption and black money.
Had the work of the House been done then there would have been good discussions.
Some people are spreading rumours that political parties have all kinds of concessions.
Law is the same for everyone.
Be it an individual or an organisation or a political party, everyone should follow the law and everyone has to do it.
Those who cannot support corruption and black money openly spend time searching for the government's errors.
There is also a question about why the rules should be changed again and again.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, what is the strength of those who have been involved in this period of dishonesty and corruption
When I decided to fight these people, they tried hard to defeat the government every day.
On the other hand, many citizens have written letters to discuss the ongoing non-transactions and various twists.
The common man is giving more and more information than the information that comes from the government system.
The success that we have achieved is due to the awareness of the common man.
The government has prepared an e-mail address to provide this kind of information and this information can be sent on it.
I express my gratitude to all those who write such letters, their letters have faith and blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of exhaustion or stopping and no question of exhausting the work for which 125 crore people are blessed.
You would be aware that there is a law in the context of Benami Property in our country which was enacted in 1988.
He had kept a hooligan in the basan.
We took him out and enacted the Effective Benami Property Act.
In the coming days, this law will show its impact.
Our topmost priority has been to do whatever is required for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people.
Indias ranking has improved in the World Banks Doing Business Report.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and jumped 19 places in the World Banks Domestic Performance Index 2016.
The evaluation of several reports is guiding such a way that India is moving fast.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country were despised by the Parliament session.
Everyone expressed his anger over the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also openly expressed dissatisfaction over this.
However, some good things happen in such situations and the mind gets satisfactory.
A good work was done in the Parliament but it did not notice the country's attention.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud and happy to say that a bill related to the campaign for the disabled persons has been passed by my government.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this thing. I express my gratitude to them on behalf of crores of people with disabilities of the country.
Our government is also committed towards Divyangjans.
I have tried to speed up this campaign personally.
I wish that the persons with disabilities get their rights and that respect be given to them.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters renewed our efforts and confidence by winning four medals in the Paralympics.
He elevated the dignity of the country due to his victory and also surprised the people with his capability.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have an invaluable legacy and strength like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after the Bill is passed for the benefit of the Persons with Disabilities, they will get more employment opportunities.
Reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has enacted a new legislation in accordance with the United Nations Convention.
This includes 14 categories.
My young friends, you will be proud of the sports fields in the last few weeks.
The Indian Cricket Team won 4-0 against the United Kingdom.
Some of the young sportspersons have done a commendable job.
Karuna Nair, our young sportsperson, has triumphed.
L.
Rahel played 199 races.
Virat Kohli, the captain of the Kasotti Sangh, took good care of the team and led the team.
Indian Cricket Associations of Spinner Golandaj R.
Ashwin was declared the 2016 year Creator of the Year and the Best Custom Cricketmaker by ICC.
My heartiest congratulations to you all.
In the field of hockey, after 15 years, there has been a good news and good news.
Junior Hockey Team has won the World Cup.
After 15 years, Junior Hockey Team has named World Cup.
Congratulations to the young athletes on this achievement.
This achievement is indeed auspicious for the future of Indian Hockey Team.
Our women sportspersons also performed well last month.
The Indian womens hockey team won the Asian Championship and recently the Indian womens contingent earned a bronze medal in the 18-year Asia Cup.
I congratulate all the players of cricket and hockey team from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, let the coming year of 2017 be a year of new joy and enthusiasm, let all our resolutions be fulfilled and let us scale new heights of development.
This New Year should provide an opportunity to the poorest of the poor to lead a life of happiness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I went to India-China Cyprus to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the high altitude of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of the ITBP, the armed forces.
Every time the experience of this Diwali was different.
25 billion Indians who dedicated this uniquely to the soldiers of the Indian Army, dedicated it to the security forces, the image was reflected on the faces of every soldier and the feelings were filled with fervor.
Some poems, some drawings, some cartoons, some people made videos.
It means every house used to have an army post. And when I read these letters, I was surprised.
These letters are full of innovations and emotions.
At the same time, a suggestion was received on MyGov, can we make the same coffee table book by combining the selected items
A soldier from our Armed Forces wrote to me, Prime Minister, Holi of our soldiers, Diwali and every party is at the border.
It seems as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, how the spirit of our Armed Forces in this Diwali will be limited to just a few occasions
I urge you people that as a society, as a nation, we should adopt this habit, whether it is festivals or festivals, we should keep in mind the soldiers of our country.
When the Saran Nation stands with the Armed Forces, the strength of our armed forces increases by 1. 25 billion times.
A few days ago, Sarpanch from Jammu and Kashmir state had visited me.
He was a member of the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Council.
They came from different parts of the Kashmir valley and there were about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time.
He had come up with issues related to the development of his village.
And when our conversation started, it was natural that the situation in Kashmir valley, the law and order situation and the future of the children came up.
In Kashmir, schools were set on fire and I could see that the pain that our countrymen suffered was the same.
They say that there is no school but a future network of children.
I urge them to focus on the future of these children.
Just a few days ago, the board examination was conducted and almost 95 of the children and girls of Kashmir were examined by the students and students.
I would like to congratulate him for his zeal but I express my heartfelt gratitude to all his parents, relatives, teachers and Sarpanchs of all the Gram Panchayats.
Dear brothers and sisters, When I asked for your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that everyone has sent suggestions on one subject.
I would like to tell you in detail about the notes of 500 and 1000.
I was also guessing that we will have to face many new challenges in our everyday life.
There cannot be an easy way to get rid of the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by you people.
500 and 1000 notes and such a huge country, such a huge currency, billions of notes and this decision.
The entire world is looking at barracks, every economist analyses this in depth.
More than 1. 5 lakh bank employees and more than 1 lakh bank offices and more than 1 lakh bank friends have been associated with this thing throughout the country with the spirit of dedication.
Despite a lot of tensions, they are working with a quiet mind to consider this work as a sacrifice of service to the nation and a great transformation.
They start in the morning, when will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Many such incidents emerge from TV, newspapers and discussions every day.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those colleagues who have worked hard for this great service.
Efficiency is recognised only when success comes after the test.
I still remember that when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees were able to carry the burden on their shoulders and the work that had not been done for 70 years would have been done.
Today, once again he has accepted that challenge and I am confident that the resolutions of 1. 25 billion Indians will give a new strength to this nation.
However, bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not get used to that bad habit.
And some people still feel that this money of corruption, this money of black money, this money of unaccounted money, the money of benami money, some of these things will be searched and brought back to the system.
They are finding illegal ways to save their money.
Sadness is that he has chosen the path of using the poor.
They are trying to save money by misleading the poor people by putting money in their accounts or by doing some work from them.
Today, I would like to tell such people, whether they want to amend or not, whether they want to follow the laws or not, if they want to follow the laws, what should they do
But don't play with the lives of the poor by showing compassion.
And the government does not want our countrymen to face difficulties.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, Ji Hadra, Madhya Pradesh.
It is indeed commendable that we stopped the notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
I would like to bring several such examples from the Mann Ki Baat to the public that even without any hesitation, people welcomed this stern step towards nation building.
Because we used to say that good days will come but no one would have thought that we will take such a big step.
The people of black money and corruption have got a lot of courage in view of this thing.
There will never be a better day for every Indian.
I am so glad that the common man of my country has such a wonderful capability.
People go there, eat and when they go back after 2-4-6 days then they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, sacrifice and honesty.
During the elections, I had undertaken the 'Chai Pe Charcha' initiative and it had reached all over the world.
However, I dont know that we are connected to 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
In Surat, in Gujarat, a daughter gave only tea to the people who had come to her marriage.
Once I had watched the news on TV, when I was late in the night then I used to see that there is a small village named Dhekiyazuli in Assam.
What did he do when he got a Rs. 2000 note
Four of the neighbouring women came together and they went to the market and purchased it together and paid the money using a note of Rs. 2000.
See how changes are being brought about in the lives of the villages.
Some people immediately benefitted from this campaign.
At that time, I got information from small towns.
It was reported from nearly 40-50 cities that the people were not paying the money due to the closure of these notes.
We are well aware of the fact that the poor people don't have to pay money just two days ago.
Those big people, those who are familiar with them, those who knew that they would never ask for anything, they wouldn't pay for it, they wouldn't pay for it.
Each municipality gets 50 deposits in tax amount.
However, with the decision dated 8th, all of them were running to deposit their old notes.
Last year, about Rs. 3-3,500 crore was collected in 47 urban areas.
You will be surprised to know that in one week they have deposited Rs. 13 thousand crores.
But today I specially congratulate the farmers of my country.
I have been taking stock of the crop production in this season.
The farmers have searched for ways despite difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which the farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in enhancing economic conditions.
In the previous budget, we took an important decision that just like big malls, even small shopkeepers in the village can do their business for 24 hours, no law will hinder them.
Initiatives were taken to lend them loans through Mudra Yojana.
But it was natural for them to have problems.
I would like to tell my little brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity for us to enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone. You should also keep a POS machine for credit cards.
We should learn how business can be done without using a note.
Look, the way big malls, technology enhances our trade, a small trader like user-friendly technology, can enhance our trade.
There is no possibility that something will get worse and there is a chance to increase it.
I invite you to contribute immensely to the creation of a cashless society.
The roads of technology are safe, they are comfortable and are fast.
I am confident that I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers, hardworking brothers and sisters.
Friends, You are my dedicated soldier.
There is a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and the country has got the opportunity to take the economic summit.
This world does not belong to the older generation as much as we have experience.
We are aware that the previous generation does not know what the apps used to be.
We know how online banking, online ticket booking becomes possible.
There is nothing special about it.
But today the country wants to do great things, the kind of dreams that you have, the cashless society, it is true that we will not be able to achieve 100 but we have not started it.
If we start the Cashless Society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet is e-packet.
Various types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards.
But after 8th, the poor have also started using RuPay cards and their usage has increased by almost 300.
Like getting a printed card for mobile phones and a printed card for spending on bank accounts.
This work is so simple that just as we send a Whatsapp.
I know how to forward a very well-educated Whatsapp to the uneducated.
Moreover, technology is getting easier so that there is no need for smart phones for this work.
Whether it is a washerman or a vegetable seller or a milk seller or an existing letter or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have insisted on making this system easier.
All banks are working on it.
You would have read in the current press in the last two-four days, the amount of securities that has been withdrawn in the usage of such cards.
The technology that is required to spend online will be available in your mobile phones.
Otherwise, everyday, every half an hour or two hours, we can tell at least ten families what technology is being used, how technology is being used, how can our banks download it
We want to lead the campaign to make the country free of corruption, to free the country from black money, to get rid of the difficulties and problems of the people.
If the common man learns this system then perhaps it will get rid of his thinking and if all the youngsters of India embrace this thing then it will not take much time.
Within a month we will be able to become a modern India in the world.
And you can do this thing through mobile phones, you can visit 10 households everyday.
I invite you not to stop by merely supporting you, we will be the soldiers of change and we will make changes.
Let us take this fight to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are several countries in the world where the youngsters of that place have transformed the lives of the nation and the revolution was there from the youth itself.
Kenya had set up a mobile system called M-PESA, using technology and named it M-PESA.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this mission forward.
I invite you to work in a collective way, individually, in schools, colleges, universities, NCC, NSS.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji has taken forward the cleanliness drive.
I feel that cleanliness is in his veins and that is why he remembers cleanliness on his fathers birthday.
He writes a poem by Harivansh Rai ji, one ole, one ole, one ole, one soil, one life of the fun, one introduction to Mera, Harivansh Rai Vasantaraya.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through Mann Ki Baat with your thoughts, feelings and letters, on my gov and on Narendra Modi App.
The Mann Ki Baat programme was broadcast at 11 am but we will soon be able to hear the translation from regional languages.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in every corner of India with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other in the country.
Festivals are the second name of the life of Indians. And it is natural for anyone who has come from far flung places.
From Ved to today, the tradition of festivals in India has changed over time.
However, one thing reflects in this journey is that this entire journey of festivals that take place in India, its vastness, its intensity, its impact on the masses, its impact on the masses, has been linked with this formula.
The main objective of the scheme is to expand individual and individuality, to extend the scope of our limited ideas from society to the universe and achieve all these through festivals.
Our ancestors have added scientifically to the festivals, to the festivals, to the climate, to the climate, to the climate, to the climate, to the climate, to the crops, to the festivals and to the culture of health.
Today, the entire world is talking about the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of festivals in India is meant to enhance the feeling of love for nature from small children to great people.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate a festival of responsibilities towards everyone.
We take holidays on Sunday, but the older generation labourers, the Koli Bandhav used to take vacations on the new moon and the day of Porima.
This darkness is not darkness due to lack of light, it is darkness of darkness.
It is the endeavour to illuminate the darkness of the society by lighting the lamps on Diwali, to remove the darkness of the individual and to illuminate the light of positivity by lighting the lamp on Diwali.
Though the houses of the poor are soil utensils, they seem to be clean and shiny during Diwali.
In that context, Diwali is a cleanliness drive.
However, cleanliness in not only the households but also in the entire area, cleanliness in the lanes and cleanliness of the villages is the need of the hour.
In that context, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer confined to India alone.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Several governments, parliamentarians and administrators from all over the world want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
Perhaps you are aware of the fact that US Post Service has issued a Postage Stamp on Diwali this year.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his portrait of Diwali lights on Twitter.
The Prime Minister of Britain, in London, organized a grand event to bring together all societies on the occasion of Diwali, and participated in it automatically.
There is not a single city in Britain that cannot be celebrated with great enthusiasm.
What is the photograph of Singapores Prime Minister on Instagram and he has shared with the entire world with pride
16 women MPs from Singapore Parliament stand outside Parliament.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had just come here and told me that he is going to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
I would like to assert that this festival of Deepawali is a festival of inspiration from darkness to light in the global community.
In the festival of Deepavali along with new clothes and food items of various tastes cracking are played with great interest .
Children and youngsters like to fly cracks in their hearts.
Little children sometimes try to make a big noise by gathering a lot of crackers and often invite them to a bigger crisis.
Sometimes we dont even realize the possibility of setting fire to our neighbors.
It is a matter of concern that news of such accidents, news of fire and deaths occurring during Diwali days is a matter of concern.
On Diwali, many doctors are busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
In our country, the festival of Diwali goes on for a long time.
Celebrating the festival of Deepawali, we also prepare for Chhathpuja.
The festival of Chhathpuje is celebrated in the eastern part of India. This festival is celebrated for four days.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
Whatever Surya Devata gives us, it is difficult to obtain from the direct and indirect gods and goddesses.
Chhath Puja is a festival of worship of Surya .
People in the world worship the rising sun.
But Chhathpuja is such a festival where Surya is also worshipped.
It also provides a big social message.
In my spirit, the soldiers of the Armed Forces have a sense of gratitude for their sacrifice, penance and hard work. And in the same spirit, I felt that this year's Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen for the Message to Solzers campaign.
Today, I would like to say this thing in India that there will not be a sense of immense love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The way this feeling has been manifested, every citizen has a different strength.
Through your messages, the soldiers of our security forces have got new courage and renewed patience.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons or actors, all of them have expressed their feelings.
The media is an opportunity to express their gratitude to the Depot for expressing their gratitude to them.
Today, while celebrating Diwali, at the same time, a soldier is standing in the desert, someone is on the heights of the Himalayas, someone is protecting the industries and someone is watching the security of the airport, all these soldiers are carrying out innumerable responsibilities.
I can imagine how proud it will be for the soldiers of my country.
Innumerable feelings have been expressed in a symbolic manner on the hashtag, Message to Solzers.
Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has written a poem which I have read and showcased.
I am talking about Shivani Mohan.
The message to the soldiers launched by us on this occasion of Diwali gives a big boost to our soldiers.
My father and mother-in-law both were officers in the Army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are several officers in the Army Circle on the border of the country, who are receiving very good messages and they are getting a lot of encouragement.
I would like to assure you that along with the officers and the soldiers of the Armed Forces, their entire family, their wives too sacrifice immensely.
Through our message, the entire Armed Forces is receiving a very good message and I would like to convey my best wishes to you all for Diwali.
Whether it is natural calamities, the problems faced by law and order, the bold actions taken by the enemies or the brave-hearts to bring back the youngsters who have gone wrong, our soldiers are working with the spirit of the nation on every frontier of their lives.
I would like to tell you about one incident and I would like to tell you through this thing that what inspiration can be given to achieve success.
One of our ITBP personnel, Vikas Thakur is a resident of a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The name of his village is Badhana.
Our ITBP jawans went to their village on vacation.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has become a truly open defecation-free state.
Very few people go to that village.
The engineering students of the city, who were at a distance from that village, had no toilets.
The students of NCC, members of NSS and engineering decided to construct toilets in the village.
All the commodities, bricks, cements and all other necessities that were required to build toilets were carried by them on their shoulders throughout the day and carried them to that village.
They made toilets in that village and made a small village in the remotest part of the forest open defecation free.
That is why Kerala will soon become Open Defecation Free State.
Gujarat has declared all municipalities - metropolitan cities as Open Defecation Free (ODF).
10 districts have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF).
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on 1st November and has decided to make its state Open Defecation Free within a few months.
Till date, 7 districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on in all the states at a rapid pace.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I congratulate the citizens of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution towards eliminating the darkness of the country's filth.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, the first scheme has to be stopped after submission of this scheme.
However, no one pays attention to these things.
The old schemes continue, the new schemes continue, the schemes that come up are awaited and continue to work.
Those households where gas is used for cooking, those households that have electricity, do not need kerosene.
He has taken a major decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon get rid of kerosene by seeing the way they have taken up this task.
Only the mediators and the brokers will be affected.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been the guide for all of us.
It is the need of the hour to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step by one to get out of crisis.
Whatever is our old thinking, the difference between son and daughter must be eliminated in the society.
Reforms in schools are now open toilets for children and girls.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters an experience free from discrimination.
It is not right that darkness should spread in the village after the destruction of the 21st century.
The campaign to provide electricity to such villages is being successfully implemented in order to make them blind.
Successful efforts are being made to provide a smoke-free life to these five crore families.
Small merchants, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, small shopkeepers were stuck in the wicked circle of interest.
Under the Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Scheme and Jan Dhan Account, many people have been freed from this evil cycle of interest.
Direct funds are deposited in banks through Aadhaar so that the real beneficiaries get directly to them.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of common man from mediators and brokers.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of the great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who dedicated his life for the unity of India.
You will be aware that on 31st December is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel devoted his entire life to connecting the nation and he succeeded in his mission, he united everyone.
At the same time, Durdev said that on that day Indira Gandhiji was murdered.
You all are aware of the events that took place in the country after their deaths.
Sir, I would like to ask, what can be done to prevent such mischief
My dear countrymen, this is not just the sorrow of a single person.
It is a testimony to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a great job of uniting the country after Chanakya.
This injustice done to Sardar ji on the birth anniversary of the great man who spent his life for unity is painful for all of us.
However, we will not take into consideration all these difficulties, we will not have to move forward by chanting the mantra of unity.
This unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
There are several languages, different castes, different kinds of diets, but unity in diversity is India's strength, India's specialty, it's the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to save ourselves from the evils of spreading corruption and protecting the country as well.
Sardar Saheb has given us Ek Bharat, it is our responsibility to make it a Shreshtha Bharat.
The mantra of unity lays the foundation stone of Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb had started by looking at the struggles of the farmers.
But Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for the struggle but also for constructive work.
I respectfully pay my homage to Sardar Saheb and on this Ekta Diwas on 31st October, I urge you all to remember him and take a pledge of unity wherever he may be.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Kartik Poornima is a celebration of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are guided not only for the entire mankind but also for the entire mankind.
Seva, Reality and Sarbat da Bhala was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony were his mantra.
Every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev ji was aimed at liberating the society from discrimination, superstition and evil.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his colleague when he had reached the peak of untouchables, caste systems and high levels.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', like Suddha Guru Nanak Dev ji, which illuminates knowledge and inspires us to work against discrimination.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all on this Diwali dedicated to the country's jawans.
My best wishes to all of you for fulfilling your dreams and resolutions and spending your lives in happiness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
In the recent terrorist attacks in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir, we lost eighteen brave soldiers of our country.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
They will break every such bit and they will endeavour to ensure that the 125 crore people of the country live in happiness.
But the army does not speak.
Today, I would like to specially speak to the people of Kashmir.
Now the people of Kashmir have started recognizing the anti-national forces.
And as the truth has started to come to them, they have started moving towards the path of peace by separating themselves from such ideas.
Every parent feels that schools and colleges should work again at the earliest.
Farmers want to visit the markets across India for their produce and fruits.
Economic behaviour seem to be smooth.
And for the past few days, this has started smoothly.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem together, find ways and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot about the attacks through social media.
It gives an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings and feelings of every kind of people in every part of the country and this strengthens democracy.
A young man named Harsh Vardhan, who studied at the 11th edition, recently presented a different idea to me.
Then I took a pledge that I used to study more than three hours a day.
It will be useful for the country.
Harsh Vardhan Bhai, I am glad that you can think peacefully at such a young age when you are in an environmental degradation.
However, Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the connectivity that is in the minds of the citizens of the country is at a very high cost.
It is a symbol of national consciousness.
It demonstrates the resolve to do something.
Everyone wanted to do something and everyone wanted to do something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch the country's spirit in an excellent manner.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan had inspired the common man of the country to work for the country by giving this mantra.
There is another way for every citizen to express patriotism in the voices of both the bombs and the guns, which was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
Kartik has written on the Narendra Modi App that his athletes who played for the Paralympics event created history, and the sports they showed is the victory of human consciousness.
Shri Varun Viswanathan has written on Narendra Modi App that our athlete has done a very good job and we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only us, but every person in the country has been emotionally attached to our sportspersons in the Paralympics.
Going beyond sports, these paralympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have brought about a complete change in the attitude of humanity towards the disabled persons.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik said.
When she won the medal, she said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is a lot of strength in this bend .
This time, 19 athletes participated in the Paralympics event with three women from our country.
In comparison to other sports, when a person with disabilities plays physical talent, skills in sports, he added.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know that our sportspersons have won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Debendra Jhajria, who won the Gold medal, bagged the Gold in the 2nd Bronze.
And when she was born, she was not crippled, she lost her hand because of the shock of electricity.
Just imagine, the man who wins the first gold medal at the age of thirteen and wins the second gold medal at the age of twenty-four years, how much hard he has achieved in his life
Mariyappan Thangvelu won a gold medal in a high flying manner.
He does not live in a big city or even in a middle-class rich house.
At the age of twenty-four years, despite physical obstacles due to hardships, he won the medal to the country with the help of resolve.
Thaleet Deepa Malik and Vijayadhwaj were among the best.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in a high flying manner.
Very few people would be aware of the sacrifices made by these Divyangjans in the Paralympics event.
No, I was surprised when I came to know that the fourth sportsperson has not won the medals in the Divyang athletes but he has completed the race in less time than the gold medal winners in the race.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of preparing an easy plan for the development of Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was an emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibir for Persons with Disabilities and several world records were recorded at that time.
The entire Ramayana is poetically faced by Gauri Shardul and the inaccessible forests of Nang district.
And I also heard the people gathered there when people were surprised.
On that day, I had the opportunity to dedicate a book to the public, the success stories of the lives of disabled persons were compiled in it.
This experiment was registered in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of pride for all our countrymen to have three world records from differently abled persons on a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on October 2, we launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit, every citizen should be a duty, an atmosphere of contempt for cleanliness should be created.
Today, on 2nd October, when we complete two years, I can assure you that awareness about cleanliness has increased among 1. 25 billion Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everybody has tried to move ahead with a paul.
And that is why every person, every citizen, every citizen, every government or government office, every bus station or railway station, school or college, religious place or hospital, every child or senior citizen, every farmer, everybody is contributing something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also played a positive role.
I want you to move forward.
And that is why if we talk about rural India then 2 crore and 32 lakh toilets have been constructed so far.
A healthy competition has started in the states, states, districts and villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be able to achieve full success in Hong Kong Free Village Mission.
Congratulations to all those who have worked for this thing and best wishes to those who have been making efforts for this thing.
And I would urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the dignity of mothers and sisters, for the health of children.
Let us take this pledge and move forward.
Especially my young friends, I would like to present a scheme for those who use the technology in a big way.
We will be able to understand the condition of constructing toilets in our city by telephoning this number of 1969 but will also be able to apply for construction of toilets.
We should take full advantage of it, especially the younger generation should take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to come forward.
They should give sponsorship to young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the district as representatives of Swachh Bharat Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been advised to procure the fertilizer from the waste.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to provide them fertilizers.
Those who want to improve the health of our soil, those who care about the health of the soil, those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers, they have been asked to provide this fertilizer as per requirement.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a special contribution in this work as a good messenger.
I invite the youth to start a new start-up in the field of waste to well-being, waste to wealth and develop technology.
This is definitely a thing to do.
India Sanitation Conference is being organised at a special event from 25th September to 3rd October this year.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors of metropolitan cities and Commissioners from all over the country will meet together to deliberate on cleanliness and sanitation alone.
What could be technology
What could be the economic policy
How to get people's participation
How to create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I can see that new news about cleanliness is continuously coming up.
Recently I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University went to one hundred seven villages and started an awareness campaign on the construction of toilets.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, a team swimmed 2800 kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar and conveyed the message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have made their guidelines.
Each department determines fifteen days and focuses on cleanliness.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department will come together to formulate a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas in the month of October.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs will be conducting Swachhta Abhiyan in allied sectors from 16th to 31st October.
I would like to appeal to the citizens that we should also participate in those departments where we normally have a connection.
You must have seen that surveys related to cleanliness are conducted.
Earlier, surveys were conducted in 73 cities and the conditions related to cleanliness were revealed to the people of the country.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because every citizen of every city feels that we are lagging behind in this thing and now I will do something good.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all of us will contribute to it.
On 2nd October, we mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
I urge you to buy Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
I would also like to say that there should be a single commodity of Khadi in our family so that Diwali can be applied to the poor households.
On Sunday, October 2, will we be able to participate in the cleanliness drive as a citizen
Two hours or four hours, you can directly participate in the cleanliness drive. And I would like to tell you to take a photo of it and share it on Narendra Modi App.
Share video if there is a video.
Look, with your efforts, this mission will get a new strength and a new momentum.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of living in life is different, no one should enjoy it or not.
And the response that he received will be an inspiring event in the national life of India.
Several young, small and big institutions of our country, people from the corporate sector, students and NGOs will be celebrating the Joy of Giving Wick in several cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
Its mission is to bring all food items and clothes together and reach the needy people.
It gives me immense pleasure to see those poor children playing on their faces.
I want to encourage the youth of the cities where this Joy of Giving and Wik Celebration is being celebrated.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and today marks the beginning of his birth centenary year.
He explained the political ideology that millions of activists like me have been working with.
The Prime Minister reiterated Indias roots in its vision to support Indias cultural traditions.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji is being celebrated today.
His contribution is the principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the interests of every person in the grassroots.
How will the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He presented the Sarah Economic Framework in two words: Work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, on Vijayadashmi, two years ago, I started Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the kind of appreciation and blessings we have showered on this programme during the completion of two years.
I also express my gratitude to AIR for not only broadcasting Mann Ki Baat but also working hard to reach out to listeners from all regional languages.
I also express my gratitude to the audience who put the doors of the government in writing the Mann Ki Baat and showed the errors of the government, AIR took care of such letters and made available platforms to the government officials to solve the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat did not remain a mere fifteen-twenty-minute conversation, it provided an opportunity for social change.
There can be a greater pleasure for anyone.
What will be the festival that connects mankind
And that power will become a means of real power and then all of us will come together to celebrate the festival of victory.
Let us use this power, let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Celebrate the celebration of Navratri and Durga Puja along with peace, unity, goodwill to take the nation to new heights and celebrate the victory of Vijayadashmi.
English rendering of PMs address at Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Hockey's magician, Dhyan Chand's birthday is on 29th August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyanchand ji and recall his contributions on this occasion.
In 1928, 1932 and 1936, he played an important role in securing Indias Gold in the Olympics.
All of you cricket lovers know the name of Bradman.
My countrymen, just as the time of Mann Ki Baat is getting closer, several suggestions are being received on Tasha MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
Besides cricket, Indians are so much aware of other sports.
It became a source of inspiration for me to deliver this message.
Sachin says, you must speak about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
The medals you received were given by the girls.
Our daughters have proved that we are no less than any.
One of these girls is from North India, one from South India, another from Eastern India and another from India.
Therefore, it seems as if these girls from all over the country have raised the issue of illuminating the name of India.
My Govt. Shri Thakur wrote that we can do better in Olympics.
He says, "Congratulations to Your Excellency Modi for winning two medals in Rio first.
But I would like to draw my attention to it, was it really good for us
And the answer is, no
We need to scale great heights in the field of sports.
Our parents focus on todays study.
The society also believes that sports is a waste of time.
We cannot ignore that we have not been able to achieve our goals.
In some cases, the sportspersons who were performing well in India, the sportspersons were not able to show up there and only two medals were won in the medal tally.
One more thing is true that if you dont get medals then you will realise that for the first time Indian sportspersons have done something better in sports.
Just observe that in Nambaji, our innovative Bindra ji was at the fourth position and in a very short span of time he won the medal.
This was the case with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in Tennis.
For the first time in thirty-two years after Usha, Lalita Babar was eligible for the final round of the track field.
You will be happy to see that after 36 years the women hockey team reached the Olympics.
For the first time in 36 years, the men's hockey team has been successful in reaching the knockout ferry.
Our team is strong and it is a part of destination that whoever won the gold medal in Argentina, who losed the same battle in the entire competition, who defeated them
Some sportspersons like Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das.
My countrymen, we have a lot to do but whatever we have done so far and if we continue to do something then our office will again be disappointed.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will conduct a thorough study and will examine what is done in the field of sports around the world.
A committee will formulate a roadmap on what we can do.
We need to make schemes with a vision for 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I also urge the state governments to set up such committees, what we can do in the field of sports, what one state can do, state should choose one or two sports and think about the strength we can achieve in that game.
And I believe that we are a country with 65 per cent of the population of 1. 25 billion Indians, together we will achieve the best position in the world of sports.
We have to move ahead with this resolution.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Teachers Day on 5th September
For a few years, I have been spending time with the students on Teachers Day and I was spending time with them as a student.
I was also learning a lot from these students.
For me, September 5 was Teachers' Day and Education Day.
So, I feel like expressing my feelings in Mann Ki Baat...
The place of mother in life is also the place of teachers.
I also saw teachers who are more concerned about our people than themselves.
He devotes his life to his disciples and students.
Currently, after the Rio Olympics, there is talk of Pullela Gopichand.
They are not only sportspersons but also showcased the excellent teachers.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On 5th September, the birth anniversary of former President of India Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and the entire country considers this day as a teacher's day.
Even if he reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the role of a teacher himself.
Written in such a beautiful handwriting and my own letter is very bad.
And that is why someone showed a good signature that I feel respected.
You must share photos with your teachers on Narendra Modi App, you must remember, you must share them.
Remember, it would be precious for us to see the contribution of teachers from the perspective of the students.
Ganesh Utsav will be celebrated in a few days.
Ganesh ji is an obstacle, we all feel that our country, our society, our family, every individual and their lives should be smooth.
When we think of the festival of Ganeshotsav then it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of Ganesh Utsav is a tribute to Lokmanya Tilak.
We need to create programmes that will give a new impetus to the society and also give a new impetus to their self-rule and I will achieve it at the centre.
Today, the festival of Ganesh Utsav has started not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions, queue competitions are held.
Social topics are touched in a artistic way.
Lokmanya Tilak inspired us to give us the mantra of 'Swarajya' as our birthright.
Can we not give the message of the mantra of 'Surajya' to the people of Ganesh Utsav that is our right, let us move towards 'Surajya'
I invite you.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festival brings a new spirit in the individual and society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change as per the demand of the times.
On this occasion, I have come to know that some people, especially Ganeshotsav and Durgapuja, have written a lot about the environment.
Idols made from POP are not environment friendly.
This pain is intensely narrated by others as well.
I pray that we should use the idols of Ganesha and Durga Mata of Shadu as in the ancient times and not follow our old traditions.
Conservation of environment, conservation of our river ponds, protection of small animals from pollution in a way is a service to God.
I don't know what kind of feelings we will take these issues, but I don't say this alone but this is what many people say.
In some opinions, it was felt that Abhijit Dhondaphale, the iconographer of Punya, the founder of Kolhapur, the science prabodhini.
Environment friend Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
There is a lot of time for Durga Puja .
I convey my best wishes to all of you for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the Sant Degree on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor of India.
Mother Teresa, who served the poor people of India throughout her life, is proud of all Indians.
The event will be held on 4th September, where a delegation of officials led by the Government of India and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be held on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then a big change takes place.
Manpower is God's form.
In the last few days, the Government of India in collaboration with the five State Governments has made a successful effort to bring people together for clean Ganga and cleaning the Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the village heads were invited to the Ganga coast at Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all the chiefs of Uttar Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for coming to Allahabad for this solemn pledge.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for realizing this vision.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the cleanliness drive of the Ganga by bringing together the peoples strength.
Somebody wrote from English and somebody from Hindi, somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their houses.
He called for the construction of toilets.
Some kids have written that this year my birthday will not be celebrated but it will be possible to construct a toilet.
This work was done by these children of seven to seventeen years.
It had such an impact and it had an emotional effect that on the second day when I went to school, my parents wrote letters to the teachers to give it to them.
Congratulations to those who made this vision and also congratulated the parents for their efforts. They decided to make the children's letters smoothly on their minds and make them toilets.
A sixteen year old daughter Mallama from this district called Satyagraha against her family.
Features of the village chief Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and constructed toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has been the dream of every Indian.
This is the solemn pledge of some Indians.
Some Indians have set their goals.
However, everybody has been associated with it, everybody has contributed something or the other.
Everyday news comes about who makes every effort
The Government of India has asked the people to make a film of two-three minutes of cleanliness and send it to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the television channels that we should also make such competitions.
Ideas of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness drive.
I invite my countrymen, India has always wished to have a neighbourhood relationship.
However, this is not an ordinary radio channel but an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are today connected with the same cultural tradition.
They will interact and share ideas and enjoy the joys of AIR from both sides.
All India Radio is a major contributor to people-to-people contacts.
The Channel was inaugurated by the President.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I also convey my best wishes to all my friends in All India Radio. They are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, we have assigned to me the post of Prime Minister but in the end, I am a man like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me very much.
Some such emotional events also inspire and inspire me to do something for the people of India.
A 84 year old mother-in-law is a retired teacher who wrote to me.
Though I have told you not to declare my name, I would like to mention his name.
In a letter, he said that he urged us to give up the gas subsidy and then gave up the subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago, a person from amongst us came and gave me a letter and thanked me for giving it a Live Lit up.
For me, this letter of the Prime Minister of India is no less than a Padma Shri.
Friends, the countrymen tried to give a letter to those who had given up their LPG subsidy and somebody would give it to my representative.
I am trying to provide letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, your mission to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke of stealth and I will be a retired teacher in a few years.
I am sending a donation of fifty thousand rupees so that the poor mothers get rid of the smoke from the stove.
We are aware of the fact that a mother who earns 50 thousand rupees for gas connections from the pension of a normal teacher is not fifty thousand rupees.
This is the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters that strengthen the confidence of our country's future.
He did not write this letter to me as Prime Minister but wrote simple letters - Modi Bhaiyya
Flood situation has occurred again and again in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local government, the social institutions and the citizens have provided all possible assistance.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including the parties opposed to the political spectrum, had together passed the GST Bill.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and if all the parties move together then it is an example of this thing.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country, in relation to the situation that had happened in Kashmir, had raised the issue in one voice.
Those who try to create anxiety by furthering these small children, they will sometimes have to answer this thing to the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is big and diverse.
As a citizen, as a citizen, as a society, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen those things that contribute to unity and only then will the country brighten its future.
I have full faith in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
Today morning I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will paint the color of every youngster in the country with enthusiasm and hope.
All of us are aware that within a few days a massive sporting event will take place all over the world.
Rio is going to ears again and again.
25 billion people of the country have worked to enhance the confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to play in Rio.
Wherever we may be in the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after working hard.
This is a kind of hard penance.
Winning and losing are important, but it is even more important to reach out to that game. And that is why all of us convey good wishes and good wishes to all the sportspersons for the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poet-loving student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay has sent a poem.
There will be several poets amongst you who have written poems, maybe they will write poems, some people will make that sound, they will do it in every language, but the poem that Suraj has sent me is sharing with you.
Ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam ji.
The entire country and the world paid tributes to him. But when the name of Abdul Kalam ji comes, then the words Science, Technology and Missile come and the image of a strong India comes to the fore and hence Ankit ji has written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Abdul Kalam ji
Ankit ji is right to say
And if we want to go with her or go beyond that then we should do research and innovation. And both these things are the life of technology.
If research and innovation are not there then just as the accumulated water produces foul smell, technology also remains a burden.
The government has taken some steps to create sweetness in science, attraction for technology, research and innovation in the new generation so that we can become outdated in the changing era. And therefore, I would like to say, "Let us aim to innovate".
And when I say let us aim to innovate, then my AIM means:
10 lakh will be given to those schools where such tinkering labs will be constructed and Rs. 10 lakhs will be given for care for them for five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
We see problems and difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find a technology-based solution.
We have urged the youth of the country through Atal Grand Challenges that if we face any problem, if we face any problem then find it through technology, research, innovation and bring it with us.
And I am glad that people are interested in this thing when we came to know about the Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we were also worrying about the drought. These days we are enjoying the joy of rain and news of floods is also coming.
The state government and the central government are working shoulder to shoulder with the help of flood affected people.
Despite some difficulties due to rains, everyone's heart was happy, human mind was happy because the centre of our entire economic upheaval was rains and agriculture.
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to repent at birth .
But if we are aware, if we are alert, if we keep trying then the ways to avoid them become easier.
However, we sometimes feel a little sad about the action.
The government, the hospitals and the doctors will do their work but we should also be aware of the fact that dengue does not enter our houses, our departments and our families, so that there is no disease in the water.
My dear countrymen, I would like to draw our attention to another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast and because of constant pace, we dont have time to think about ourselves.
If the patient falls sick then it seems that heals soon and netibiotics are taken for it.
We should not follow the shortcuts.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even after quitting half the time the bacteria will be benefitted. Even after taking more than necessary bacteria will be benefitted hence the course of taking the pills in as many days has been proved .
It is necessary to fulfil that course but it is necessary to complete that course.
In medical terms, it is called netibiotic resistance, how to use netibiotics, its rules should be followed.
There has been a sudden decline in the maternal mortality rate in the last decade but even today the lives of pregnant mothers can not be saved in a very big way.
The deficiency of blood during pregnancy , infection during pregnancy , high blood pressure , no one knows the obstacles in their life .
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign called Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
With this campaign on the ninth of every month the pregnant women will get free check up done at the government health center .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I have urged the gynaecologists to ensure that you cannot provide free service to the poor mothers on 9th.
Whether my doctor brothers and sisters cannot spend 12 days in a year for the poor
There are thousands of such doctors, they have written letters to me, following my appeal and taking forward the work.
There are thousands of such doctors who believed in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
There is no plant that does not have medicinal properties.
The trees that donate the trees also treasure the trees in heaven like their own.
But in today's generation too, there are some people who follow these ideals and follow them.
According to the discipline observed in Mahabharata, the trees also perform the responsibilities of children in the world, Sonol has taken upon himself the task of fulfilling the wishes of not only his parents but the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, performed his grandson Sonal's wedding in a different way.
Temples should start a tradition of planting plants in good rainy season.
Plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I have been consistently telling the farmers that because of dams falling on the edge of our farm, can we cultivate timber instead of dams
Today, in order to build a house in India, we have to bring millions and millions of buildings and wood from abroad.
If we plant trees around our farms that will be useful for the work of wood and households, it can be cut and sold after fifteen-twenty years with the permission of the government, it can provide a new source of income to you people and we can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, several states have been conducting expeditions using the weather conditions. Government of India has recently approved a CAMPA Act and more than Rs.
I was told that the Maharashtra government had planted 1. 25 crore trees in the entire state on July 1 and had taken a pledge to plant three crore saplings next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhoomi have organized a big forest festival and have resolved to plant 5.
Five and a half lakh trees in Rajasthan are not small .
Those people who know the land of Rajasthan can realise that they have taken up a very big task.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase green cover by 50 by 2029.
Railways has also started this work in the Green India Mission which has been launched by the central government.
Gujarat has a bright tradition of the Suddha Forest Festival.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van have been undertaken in Gujarat under Van Mahotsav and a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone is eligible for appreciation.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
Whenever there is a foreign tour, there is talk of international policy trade, security related discussions are held, some MoUs are going to be signed.
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage.
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness fall on the ears of the world then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela come before us.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be remembered.
Equality and equal opportunities are not such a big mantra for any society and government.
Samabhav and Mambhav take us to a bright future.
We all hope for a good life, we want a better future for children, the needs of everyone are different, the foremost are different, but the path is one and that is development, equality, equality, equality and harmony.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have shown the essence of life in South Africa.
He told me about one incident, Prime Minister, I am talking about artificial warming from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman was smuggled and lost Rs. 11 lakhs due to a false e-mail and committed suicide.
As a woman, I was deeply saddened by this.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everyone knows this thing that when we get to know about the things that are fascinating on our mobile phones and on e-mails then the fascinating message comes to the fore that you are apprehensive about the amount and you will be able to get so much money.
Some people are enticed and some are enticed with greed.
These technologies are spreading across the world.
Sometimes we are also fascinated.
I feel that we should be cautious about this obsession, we should be cautious. If there is such a false news then we should tell them in our friends' circles, we should make them aware.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet many people during the current session of Parliament.
Our Parliamentarians bring people from their respective departments, they meet, they talk about them, they say their obstacles.
But I had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The enthusiasm of the children and the daughters was to be seen and they had brought a huge album along with themselves.
Artistic paintings have been depicted and painted at the station.
You must visit Aligarh and watch this station .
This is an example of how change can be brought about by peoples participation.
Thanks to all those who have worked like this in the country, I specially congratulate my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, there is a season of festivals in our country along with rainy season.
Festivals are celebrated in temples and pilgrimage centres.
You are also connected to these festivals at home and outside.
Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of our strictness .
Can we not present the festival of Rakshabandhan this year as a gift of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to our mothers and sisters of our country
Just imagine, please visit a sister so that her life can be safeguarded.
Moreover, we can offer the festival of Raksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to a woman who makes a meal in her house, who cleanses her house, who is a daughter of a poor mother.
My dear countrymen, many of you are those who were born after Independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country, born in an independent India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can inspire us, create new zeal and hope. This can be an opportunity for the country to do something for the country.
Freedom Festival is not a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that we too will do something good to connect with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I got the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort.
There will be a lot of things in your mind, you will have that kind of desire, that thing should be inspired from the Red Fort.
As your representative, as your Prime Minister, you must send me from the ramparts of the Red Fort and give me some suggestions and suggestions.
I invite you, let us recall the heroes who have sacrificed their lives for freedom, let us recall the great men who laid down their lives for India and let us move ahead with a resolve to do something for the country.
Once again I got the opportunity to make Mann Ki Baat.
For me Mann Ki Baat is not a ritual.
I am eager to interact with you automatically.
And I am glad that I can reach every corner of the country through Mann Ki Baat.
I express my gratitude to All India Radio for the successful efforts made by All India Radio to translate Mann Ki Baat into Regional Language at 8.
And I am glad that those citizens who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programme, they deliver their feelings to me through the telephone channel, through the MyGov website and through the Narendra Modi App.
The suggestions made by you people help me in running the government.
How active should the government be for the welfare of people
How much priority should be given to the welfare of people
Therefore, my interaction with you is very important.
5th June is World Environment Day.
Environmental issues are discussed and discussed around the world.
The main theme of the World Environment Day on this occasion is Ero Tolerance for Elligible Wildlife Trade. We should talk about trees and water.
You must have seen that the forests near the Himalayan foothills of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir had recently been hit by heavy rains.
Therefore, saving forests and saving water becomes the responsibility of all of us.
He interacted with the Chief Ministers of each state for about two-and-a-half hours.
I heard about what I wanted to tell them.
Some States, especially Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have utilised technology in a big way.
We need to take these successful steps taken by the State Governments to other States of the country through NITI Aayog.
In order to overcome such problems, public participation becomes the main cause of success.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important.
Therefore, Drop More Crop- Each drop More Production, Micro Irrigation, Micro Irrigation, Micro Irrigation, Low Water PK.
It is a matter of happiness that the sugarcane farmers in many states are now using drip irrigation and micro irrigation and some are using Tushar irrigation.
I also came to know from them that many states have huge targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, which have done a great job in drip irrigation.
It is their effort to bring 2-2-3 lakh hectares of land under micro irrigation every year.
If this mission is being carried out in all the states then it will not only benefit agriculture but it will also increase the storage of water.
Our brother-in-law Mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to use Godavari and Krishna rivers in a better way through this project.
Efforts are being made to replenish ground water through the Niru PRAGATI mission in Andhra Pradesh with the help of technology.
The people of Maharashtra are not only providing Shramdaan but also providing financial assistance to the people of Maharashtra.
I am sure that the Jal Yukt Shivar Abhiyan will be useful in saving Maharashtra from future water conservation.
The State of Chhattisgarh has taken up the mission of LokSaraj-Jalsurajya.
A massive campaign has been undertaken to revive Rajasthan and Gujarat in the form of Jal Mandir.
But some parts of that state have water conservation.
A big work is being done by constructing checkhams and small bundles there.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water , therefore we went out dry and after the rains we did not get water , therefore how would it be
And the issue of water is not limited to farmers alone.
This topic is related to villages, poor, labourers, farmers, urban, rural, rich and poor.
And this year when we celebrate Diwali, how much water was saved during the rainy season
You will see, your joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just the work of the government, it is not only of the political leader but also of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India is going to be transparent.
They are going to take India from one end to the other in a similar way.
We will have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I would like to touch upon one such topic that if you help me in that direction we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a cashless society.
Through electronic technology, we can get money and send money.
There is no fear of stealing pockets from your pockets.
It will be automatically recorded.
Using this method will be a little difficult initially but once the habit is over, this system will become easy.
This is possible because in the last few days the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, Aadhaar numbers were also available and mobile phones are now in the hands of almost every Indian.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-Jam (JAM)
We can move forward towards a cashless system, cashless society by blending the GST regime.
You must have seen that RuPay cards have been issued along with Jan Dhan accounts.
It will be useful for both Card Credit and Debit in the coming days.
And a small machine has also been provided with the help of PSUs.
O.
It is called PANIT OF SELL, through which you can pay others through Aadhaar numbers, RuPay cards.
One of the initiatives undertaken by the Government of India is how money can be paid through POS
The second initiative we have undertaken is Bank on Mobile.
It will be easier to exchange money through your mobile phones.
In a way, this is a step taken by the bank in this direction.
The process of providing banking services to the post offices is also going on.
If we learnt to use this method, if we develop that habit then there will be no need for direct currencies, there will be no need to take money into the pocket.
Transactions will be automatically transparent.
Unaccountable transactions, two numbers of transactions will stop.
The impact of black money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge the countrymen to start this thing.
You see, once this system has started, we can move forward in a simple manner.
Twenty years ago, no one felt that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
Slowly it becomes a habit and now it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that the cashless society will gradually be shaped.
However, it will be better if it comes in a short span of time.
We should encourage our sportspersons who are participating in the Rio Olympics and enhance their self-confidence.
He was the Chief Ministerial candidate.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Whether they get nutritious food as per the requirement or not .
Whether the teachers who should be there for their physical fitness or not
Whether it is the result of elections or the possibility of assuming new responsibilities as the Chief Minister, I am glad to see that a colleague of mine has been so awakened to his work as the Sports Minister in such an environment.
When our sportspersons believe that the 125 crore Indians are standing with us, this becomes a force and reiterates their self-confidence.
Last time I had taken up the topic of FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup.
I received suggestions from all over the country and during this period I can see that the atmosphere of football is getting ready all over the country.
Many are taking initiatives and creating their own teams.
I have received several suggestions regarding this on the Narendra Modi App.
It is possible that many of them would not be sports but it was a pleasant experience for me to have an interest in sports in the minds of thousands of youngsters of the country.
We are well aware of the relationship between cricket and India, but I have seen such a love for football
Everything should not be counted on the scales of victory and defeat.
India should create its identity in the world with the spirit of sportspersons.
I urge my countrymen to do something for creating an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm for our friends in sports.
For the last eight-ten days, new results are coming out from nowhere.
I am not talking about the results of the elections. I would like to talk about those students who have been studying and examining with NEET throughout the year.
It is now evident that the results of the 10th-12th are coming in one go and our daughters are gallantry.
It's a matter of happiness.
We must move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a different kind of question and I had never thought about it.
I was very happy to read this thing.
They say that when I went home after getting 89. 33 marks, I felt that I would be praised all around, it would be a rain of congratulations but I was told by the house that if I had got 4 marks, it would have been 90.
But I feel a strain on my mind.
I read your letter with pride, I believe that this pain can not be of yourself but of millions and millions of students like you.
Because the environment has been created so that the pleasure and happiness of the people could be solved.
This is another form of negative attitude.
I would like to urge the people and the parents of the neighbourhood to accept and welcome the results that your children will receive.
Otherwise, one day you will get 100 quantity but somebody will say that you have achieved 100 per cent mark but if you have imagined it then it would have been even better.
Therefore, it is necessary that every thing has a limitation.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written a similar letter.
They say that their closest people are not willing to accept their results.
They have been saying that something good has been done and something good has been done.
I would like to tell you that you should not balance yourself in such a situation.
Everybody expects and listens.
Stay firm on your resolve and try to do something better.
But if we do not believe in what we have achieved then we will never be able to build new things.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the songs of the successes that have been achieved.
Those who do not get the best qualities in the examination go ahead in sports, move forward in the field of music, move forward in the area of art sports and business.
God has given everyone some skill.
Please recognise your inner strength and emphasize that you will make progress in your life.
There was a time when the soft music was an integral part of the folk music in Kashmir valley.
But Pandit Sivakumar, who swept this musical instrument, today became an important player in the field of global music.
In the field of Indian music, the sun was a limited player.
During the reign of kings and kings the place of Sun was attached to the entrance door of the court .
But Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this instrument and placed the sun at the height of the world's best instrument.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I realise that the expenditure on medicines in the poor families of our country is going to bring down the financial burden of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very low but after falling sick the health again becomes the same as before but it costs a lot.
Why should we not keep our lifestyle so that we dont fall sick, we dont have any financial burden on our families.
In fact, cleanliness is the most important way to stay away from diseases.
The biggest service to the poor is cleanliness.
And the second thing is that for which I relentlessly insist on Yoga.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
The entire world has an attraction for Yoga, it is a devotion and the world has adopted it.
This is an invaluable gift given by our ancestors to the world.
Yoga gives the power to a stressful world to live a balanced life .
It becomes easy for those associated with Yoga to remain healthy, to remain balanced, to have a strong will power in their minds, to concentrate on everything.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme festival.
And sometimes a collective environment can change the life of a person.
I hope that on 21st June, we will do something about it.
The culture of the entire office changes and the atmosphere changes.
Can we use this 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can Yoga be done in our social life
I urge you not to stay behind.
Being healthy is extremely important for making India healthy .
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through Mann Ki Baat.
I had given you a mobile number several days ago and you could hear Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever we want to hear Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call to this number, we can hear it in that language.
Hello.
We decide to do a lot of things during the holidays.
The programme comes and during this vacation season, as a result of Ambassador, one feels like enjoying Ambassador. It feels that if one does a little lunch in the afternoon then it will be a bit barren.
But this time it has enjoyed all around due to extreme heat.
It is natural that there is a climate of care throughout the country.
And whenever there is a continuous drought in it, the water bodies flourish.
Sometimes the water storage in the reservoir is less than the capacity of the reservoir due to encroachment, sometimes due to narrow passages, sometimes due to obstruction.
And the water storage capacity is reduced by years.
And yet I have seen that even the citizens make very good efforts for this.
In many villages, there is awareness about it and only those who have faced the crisis of piracy know the true value of water.
And there is a sense of sensitivity about water conservation and there is also an urgency to do something about it.
Just a few days ago, I was told that the Hivare Bazar Gram Panchayat of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and its villagers have handled the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
He decided not to mix crops such as rice, pulses, bananas etc.
It feels very easy to hear but it does not seem as easy as it is.
Everyone must have taken a big pledge together.
He took the initiatives of Tushar irrigation, drip irrigation, water conservation and water conservation. And today this village is standing on its own to overcome the shortage of water.
Finally, I would like to tell you about this small village of Hivare Bazar but I would like to congratulate all such villages and the villagers for their excellent work.
They built fields for nearly seventy-seven years.
As a result, groundwater levels have risen and water levels have risen.
When the crops need water, they get water, he added.
Their income from agriculture has increased by twenty percent.
Besides conserving water, the water quality improves.
However, many such initiatives are being implemented by the citizens who never come forward.
The government has launched a good mission and sometimes it gets popularity but if we look around it then we will see how innovative measures are being taken to mitigate the drought.
It is a human nature that whenever there is a crisis, but if we know something good then we feel that the crisis is over.
It is very likely that there will be rainfall of 106 to 110 in the monsoon season this year. And it is as if a peace message has been received by all.
It is still time for rain but it brings about good rainfall.
Can we take up a mission to save water from the village right now
Farmers need soil and it becomes useful for the crops in the field.
And if we take out the village bottom and throw it into the fields then it will be beneficial for the farming as well as the capacity to store water at the grassroots.
Our villages will get water.
Today, the water crisis is there, the situation of drought is there, but the coming month and a half is in our hands.
Their concern is adventurous because this work has been going on for nearly thirty years.
Several governments were formed, several schemes were formulated and a lot of money was spent.
Ganga gives us blessings, Ganga gives us employment, we get a new strength to live up to the Ganga.
The flow of Ganga gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us Ganga but today crores of Bhagiraths are needed to save her.
This campaign will never succeed without peoples participation.
Several efforts are being made at the government level.
Efforts are being made to obtain cooperation from the states of Ganga.
Efforts are being made to involve social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga clean and to prevent industrial pollution in Ganga water.
Everyday solid waste comes out of the canals and drains of the Ganga.
In order to clean the waste, trash schemes are being used to clean the waste water in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
This has been made available to all local administration agencies and they have been asked to use it to clean the garbage.
Recently, I was told that 3 tons to 11 tons of waste is being removed every day where these efforts are being made in a better way.
That is, it is a fact that such a massive amount of dirt has stopped coming from growing.
In the coming days, a plan has been made to set up a trash skimmer at some other places and the people living in the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will be able to experience it soon.
In order to curb industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with paper industries, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar mills.
And today I believe that it will have good results.
The error of waste fluids falling from the paper mills is now almost on the way to closure .
This is the symptom of this thing that we are taking steps in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that whenever a person meets me in the southern part of the river, he tells me that Ganga will not be cleaned.
This belief of the common man will help in achieving the goal of cleaning the Ganga.
Citizens are donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
This is the date when Panchayati Raj was started in our country.
And gradually the Panchayati Raj system spread all over the country is working successfully as an important component of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mhow, the birthplace of Dr. Ambedkar on 14th April.
On the 24th of this day, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in the state of Jharkhand where our tribal brothers and sisters live in large numbers.
He also interacted with all Panchayat Institutions across the country at 3 pm.
This campaign has done a great job in creating awareness.
How will the democratic institutions be strengthened at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village become self-reliant
In some villages, food grains were taken up.
The awareness that has come from the villages is the same thing as India-Uday.
This is the baseline of India-UDAY.
Therefore, if we emphasize on the rise of Gram Uday then we will not have the desired results without achieving it.
Shermila Gharpure called from Mumbai and expressed her concern.
I am speaking at Sharmila Gharpur from Mumbai.
I have a question of school and college education.
The education sector needs reforms over the years.
Not having proper school or college or the quality of education .
Children are not familiar with many basic things even after completing their education, so that their children in the world are left behind.
What are our ideas about this
Today, every family has the biggest dream of mothers and daughters that is the education of children.
And I believe that the families in which this awareness is realized, the results are visible on the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and every government has made efforts in its own way.
But the more important it is now, the more it is for the reforms in our education system.
We have done a massive work of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
uality education should be our priority from literacy missions.
Today, we have to keep in mind the roadmap that has been calculated.
Today, the priorities are being seen to see how many children came to school.
We will have to focus on providing good education and proper education to those children who have come to school.
You must have seen that in the budget of this government an attempt has been made to provide good education.
We have been asked to free ten government universities and ten private universities from government control and come up at challenging and competitive levels.
Would you like to work for becoming the best universities and best universities
The scheme has been implemented with the objective of providing them with full freedom.
Alongside the importance of education is as important .
Citizens have been asking me about one issue for the past few days.
Writing on the web portal MyGov, a few people write on my Narendra Modi app, and a large number of young people write in it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnawal.
Besides education, sports is also important for the youth of today.
They should have unity, good leadership, which will lead to all-round development.
I want you to encourage more and more youngsters and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to my mind to talk to all the boards before talking to you.
And when I asked them that when earlier such a meeting was held then their answer was that this is the first such meeting of the country since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those young friends who have urged me to do this thing.
A lot of work is being done at your level, but if our organisations work in a collective manner, in an organized manner, then it can have a big impact.
Now it is true that I myself became the cadet of the National Cadet Corps (NCC).
I got the benefit of it in my childhood and I also believe that there should be a new consciousness in such organizations.
I put forward a few points in this meeting.
I had to talk to him on a number of issues.
What kind of innovations can be brought about in the programmes of several youth organisations
If you write this on my Narendra Modi App then I will reach the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a boost.
I believe that you will also feel that you should associate yourself with all these people.
My dear countrymen, I have to tell you one thing that you will be compelled to think.
I believe that this is an awakening to all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country is such that in the last several elections, how much gas cylinder will a party give
And every political party used to feel that gas cylinders were a very important issue if they wanted to reach out to the middle class people in the election process.
This is a universal experience.
However, it was never thought of going outside this threshold.
Today, my countrymen, I am glad to share my suggestions with you.
I chose different routes and that path was to trust the people.
Sometimes we have to trust our people more than political leaders believe in themselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
Grants in our country have denied grants for such an equation.
I would particularly urge all the political parties to do at least one thing to believe in people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought of it.
We have to move in this direction.
And I always feel like I have come to my mind as to why should I have an interview for the third and fourth class jobs
Believe those who have qualified, have sent them.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there will not be any penance for tickets on this one line of railways.
This cannot be a government rule but it can create an environment of confidence.
And it is not a political leader who creates this environment but one crore families of the country have created it.
Every breaking news is painful in every newspaper and news channel.
Whether something good happens around us in this country with a population of 1. 25 billion people
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his deepest condolences, but I believe that this anger is not upon me but upon the condition of annoyance.
You might remember that our former President, Dr.
I have noticed that some television channels provide a specific time for positive news.
Today, an atmosphere of positive news is being created.
Everyone wants to get accurate news and good news.
It is true that when a bigger person uses the best words and uses the best words in a better way then the better results are better than the positive results.
It is true that if we focus more on goodness then there will not be much space for evil.
If light drinks then darkness will be removed and it will be possible only.
And that is why you might be surprised that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
It is not only for the government but also for the citizens.
And this is an unprecedented portal on which you can send a good news of yourself.
You can contribute.
Ravi ji, you have given a good suggestion but please don't stay on me.
The Kumbh Congregation is a unique feature of our country.
Kumbh fair can be a center of attraction for tourism .
Very few people of the world knew that crores of people come to the river bank for such a long time.
Festival is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment .
They are setting new benchmarks for public participation in the programme management and for organizing such events.
For the last two days, I have been watching that many people have been uploading the photographs of Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India to compete with the tourism departments of the state governments and invite people to take out the best photographs and upload them.
It is not only that cleanliness should be there but the people who return from there will carry the message of cleanliness.
I believe that Kumbh is a religious, spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social gathering.
I am glad that as usual, things in our hearts have linked me with things that are in my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is always awaiting me and you too.
During this time, I have seen a lot of letters, responses, phone calls, many things, suggestions and inspirations. Everybody sees and feels like doing something or the other. And there is a lot in them that I want to include but it is time limited so that everyone cannot be included.
Yet, I would like to share your thoughts with you once again after being buried under the guise of Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that last time I had talked about some books of Premchand ji and you had decided to share some of the books that I read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have suggested to me that I should talk about some more books.
But one thing should be conceded that I cannot give time to save books on a large scale.
But one advantage is that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of several books that you write and write.
However, I feel that we should take this initiative forward with the experience of the last one month.
We should make a corner of books on Narendra Modi App permanently and whenever we read a new book, I would like to write, talk about it and you can make a good name for the corner of these books.
And I am feeling that these days Indians have left their minds on the topic of water.
Several effective efforts are being made for water conservation throughout the country.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked to give a definite direction to a stream that flows through the mountains by performing Shramdaan.
And that too is Swadeshi.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil smoke and crops but also brought water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful North-Eastern states of Meghalaya are the first state in the country to formulate a water policy.
I congratulate the government of that place.
In Haryana, the crops that lack water are being promoted and the farmers are not harmed.
Several fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from every corner of the society go to the fairs.
In these fairs, we can deliver the message of water conservation in a very effective manner, perform exhibitions, play nook and corner.
In fact, the World Children Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
This is the next such sports event in which the youngsters who have been saved from cancer are those who have come out of their lives with cancer.
Competitions like Nambaji, Intellectuals, Watershed, Running, Football and Table Tennis were organized.
All these ten winners of our country have won medals in this competition.
Some of these sportspersons have won more than one medal.
Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Dara from Kolkata, P.
Several such people like Arvind Rao have written to me on Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, this year 2019 has been a major milestone for India in the vision of space progress.
Our scientists left ASAT space in March, followed by Chandrayaan-2.
However, during the elections there was not much talk of big and important events like ASAT.
With the help of ASAT, we have achieved the capability of launching 300 kilometers of satellites in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world to succeed and now on 22nd July, the entire country has taken its steps from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikot in space.
Photos of Chandrayaan-2 flight filled the countrymen with dignity and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the Moon.
With this, we will be able to get more detailed information about the moon, but if you ask me what two great things I got to learn from Chandrayaan-2 then I will tell you that these two things are Faith and Firelessness, faith and fearlessness.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities, and believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and spirit.
This is the mission of the entire indigenous system.
When there is talk of innovation and innovation in new areas then our scientists are the best and world class.
The second important factor is that there is no need to be scared of any crisis.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists, scientists have solved all the technological questions in a record time, in a record time and in a record time.
All the world has seen this great penance of scientists.
We all should take pride in this thing and despite all odds, the time has not changed to reach Chandrayaan.
We have often faced temporary obstacles in life but we have the capability to overcome them.
I am confident that Chandrayaan-2 will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
Finally, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September, when lander Vikram and rover technology will land on the lunar surface.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite all the students of the country, young friends, young friends, about an extremely entertaining competition to invite the youngsters and youngsters of the country.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make your participation, competition more entertaining and unforgettable.
I specially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic chiefs and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
The most thrilling thing is that the government of India will take the highest merit students from every state to Sriharikota and they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan will land on the lunar surface in September.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students so that you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to earn the best and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you will have to take a closer look.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhta Mission from time to time and has always inspired Mann Ki Baat in its efforts towards cleanliness.
The journey that began five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of many.
We have achieved an ideal position in terms of cleanliness. However, the success that we have achieved in terms of cleanliness from open defecation free villages to public places is the strength of the resolve of the 125 crore Indians but we will not stop here.
This campaign is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in America and has returned to India to serve Mother India.
Some time ago, he took up the task of not only cleaning Delhi but also making it beautiful.
He began with his team from the garbage sheds of Lodhi Garden.
Through street arts, several parts of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he started showcasing his art from overbridges and walls of the school to slums, people also got support and in a way this silsila started.
You might remember how the paintings on the roads were decorated during the Kumbh Mela.
I understand that Yogesh Saini and his team had played a very big role in that too.
There is no sound of colours and colours, but the images made from them, the message of Indradhanush is more effective than a thousand words and we also feel it in the beauty of Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is essential for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting response to my gov.
This was the reaction of Bhai Mahmood Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, I like to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in the Bank to Village programme of Community Mobility Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Also, there should be provision for online monitoring of the programme.
In my view, it was the first such programme in which people directly interacted with the government.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my curiosity to know about the Bank to Village programme increased. And when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should be aware of it.
The programme envisages how much people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development.
Several issues of literacy, sex ratio, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, rural education, senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just a formality of the government but the officers returned to the village all day. But this time, the officers had done a good job in the village for two days and also in the Panchayat so they got the opportunity to live in the villages.
Under Khelo India, children were sportspersons.
Sports Literature, MGNREGA Job Card and SC and ST certificates also appeared in the same fashion.
People of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Bank to Village programme was being organised in remote locations where government officials used to go by difficult roads and climb the hills and sometimes for one and a half days.
The officers also visited the frontier Panchayats where there was persistent fear of cross-border bullet-building and the officers went fearlessly to the highly sensitive areas of Shapiyam, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by the receptions that they stayed in villages for more than two days.
Its very pleasant that there should be a large number of rural houses in these areas and a large number of people should participate in it and prepare a scheme for us.
It is also evident that people are trying to create illusions in the path of development and they are not able to succeed in their family goals.
My dear countrymen, in one of his poems, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented the Gyanpeeth Awards as the month of Shravan.
In this poem, he has said, "Hodige Madige Agyed Agyed Lagna. "Adarag Land Magna. That is, the bonds of rain and streams of water are incomplete and the earth is delighted to see its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages across India celebrate their methods of Shravana Month.
When we look around in this weather, it seems as if the earth has dressed greenery.
There is a new energy circulation everywhere.
In this holy month, many devotees go to Kavad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while some fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagpanchami.
At the same time, the festival of Rakhipurni is also a symbol of the love and affection of a sister.
If we talk about the month of Shravan, we will be happy to know that this time most of the devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra for the last four years.
Since July 1, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
In 2015, more than all those who participated in the entire 60-day tour, more than those who participated in it, have participated in 28 days.
I also appreciate the success of the Amarnath Yatra, especially the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who return from their journey are filled with the feelings of love and affection for the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that in Uttarakhand, since the start of the Chardham Yatra this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half.
For the first time since the terrible disaster of 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have arrived here.
I would like to appeal to all of you that you must visit those areas where natural beauty can be seen during monsoons.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage are no bigger than this.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and comfortable month of Shravan will provide a new energy, new hope and a new hope to all of us.
Similarly, the month of August brings to mind the uit India Movement.
I wish that we prepare something special for the 15th of August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
When we watch TV, we see only one aspect of the rains - floods, motionless water, transportation pockets and other paintings - our farmers, birds that are enjoyed in the fields of waterfalls, waterfalls and green shawls - we will have to come out with families.
Rain, freshness and joyous freshness brings freshness and happiness with us.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stop, it takes a lot of difficulty but there is a limit of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you in Easter.
My young friends, you are busy in exams.
Today, we look forward to the multi-faceted partnership between India and Australia.
India has won the fight against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come for a new revolution in the world of sports.
And we can see that India is also creating an ecosystem for football, hockey, tennis, cubboo as well as cricket.
You may be aware that India is hosting the FIFA World Football Competition in 2017.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be participating in India.
And on the other hand, I see that the attraction of football in the youth is increasing, be it the EPL, the Spanish League or the Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to know about these collaborations and see them on television.
How to compete with the government, academic institutions and social organisations for self-connecting sports
We see that all this has happened in terms of cricket.
But we have to create the same environment for other sports as well.
It is a Golden Jubilee to recognize India.
My dear students, you must have decided on tourism during these vacation days.
And I realized that the work that we didn't accumulate in our tourism department, it was not possible for our cultural department, it was not possible for the state governments to do it and it was not done by the government of India.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there will not be a single district in India where I have not visited.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am glad that nearly 10,000 people have visited Sawaner coal mines near Nagpur as tourists.
Some efforts are being made by both the tourists and the tourists .
Efforts are not just on scientific basis but on the contrary.
Will we also pay special attention to this thing
I am sure my young friends will help me in this work.
The tourism sector is expected to generate huge employment opportunities.
India is far behind in comparison to the world in terms of tourism .
But if we decide to focus on the tourism sector of 1. 25 billion Indians then we can attract the world towards India.
A large part of the world's tourism sector can attract our country and create employment opportunities for crores of youth of our country.
We all have to do this thing together be it governance or institutions or society or citizens.
Let us make efforts in this direction.
My young friends, I don't think that such a thing has happened.
If you can't swim, you can learn to swim in these beds.
If you don't run a bicycle then you can learn a bicycle in these beds.
Even today while typing on computer I do with two fingers , should I not learn to do clean typing
There are a lot of skills for our personality development.
This will increase so much so that after the start of the school, after the start of the college, you will go back there and tell your friend that you have learnt this thing in this vacation.
My time was wasted, you came to learn new things.
Friends, there will be mutual discussions on this.
Many suggestions have been received on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat on this occasion.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.
During the summer vacations we had told that chimneys also face the problem of sunlight so that water is filled in a vessel on their balcony or mattress and kept for the chimneys .
I did that and I was glad to tell you that this made me friends with chimneys.
He telephoned me and reminded me of a good work.
The last time I remember, I had asked them to keep water in their outdoor soil utensils for the parties during the summer.
I told him that he is doing this throughout the year and he has been friends with many others.
Mahavir Verma, a great poet in the field of Hindi literature, was very much in love with the birds.
He had written in his poem that he would not let you go away, will fill the courtyard with donations and fill the hood with ham salt and sweet chilly.
May this thing be done by Mahadev ji.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into account a very important issue.
Have we ever given them water during summers
Crafts, I express my gratitude to you all, you have given a sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
Yes, it is a habit in India.
However, I express my gratitude to you for seeing this thing in a very brief manner.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India Digital India.
Some people believe that Digital India is just the world of the youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to know that a Kisan Suvidha App has been prepared for your service.
If you download the facility in your mobile phone then you will be able to get a lot of information about agriculture and climate.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this facility on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Summer is the time for others but it is the time for farmers to sweat.
It awaits rain.
The period before the start of the direct season of agriculture is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think that what will happen to us by water
Lakes, water flowing drains, waterways in the pond, where some waste is stored or some encroachment occurs, the water flow stops and as a result the waterlogging gradually decreases.
If the water was saved in the first rain, if the lake was filled, if the river drains were filled then it would be less damaged if it did not rain.
You must have seen that we have decided to construct 5 lakh crops.
Emphasis has been laid on water harvesting through MGNREGA.
There will be several such villages in the country, several progressive farmers, several aware citizens who have done this thing.
Yet there is a need to do more work today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, today I am going to tell you one more thing that the Government of India had recently organised a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technology has been cultivated.
However, it is yet to reach the fields directly.
Now the farmers are also engaged in reducing the usage of fertilizers.
We should behave in this mantra, we should move forward in our agriculture sector by using scientific methods.
I hope that in the next one-two months we will complete the necessary tasks for water conservation.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is World Health Day.
Victory on Diabetes is an announcement of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was about 6.
Diabetes accounted for 3 deaths due to deaths.
The world is worried about diabetes and therefore the theme of Diabetes is Diabetes on 7th April and World Health Day.
We all know that our lifestyle Type-II is the main cause of diabetes.
If you like yoga then do yogasana.
Otherwise do minimum walking , running .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We sometimes feel hesitant to conduct health check-ups.
And after a lot of disorder, it is noticed that diabetes has infected our body a long time ago.
This means that it is such a disease which is possible to get a quick examination.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this regard.
I would urge you all to end TB or diabetes.
And that is why I urge all the countrymen to get rid of TB in order to overcome diabetes.
The birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was specially celebrated on April 14.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
A Panchteerth - his birthplace of Mahu .
He undertook higher education in London, Nagpur.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mhow on the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a good citizen.
We can pay our homage to him as a good citizen by following his path shown by him.
In the last few days, record sustainability will start and a new record will be created.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear on your mobile phone .
We just want to give a missed call.
Please make a missed call and do it according to your convenience.
If you want to hear the programme before Mann Ki Baat then you can hear it and you can hear it in your language.
I will be happy to be with you all through this.
My dear countrymen, many congratulations to all of you.
How can we increase the interest of sports among the youth of India
Let us also participate in it.
He sent photographs of such places, he did a photo upload that he was really happy to see.
If you have the desire to see a 'Shouk-e-Didar Hai' then you should first develop the vision of watching it.
He wanted to reach the place where there was no one left before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Sawaner Sthal near Nagpur, has coal mines here.
When people go to the tourist places then they buy or spend something .
If he is a poor person, he will spend more if he is rich.
I would like to ask you one point for consideration.
Can we compil a new art, a skill in these bedrocks to achieve a new thing in our personality
Why should not you increase your strength
Do you like to paint but do not come .
Hey, hey, he will start.
You must use vacations for personality development, for learning new arts and for skill development.
There are numerous areas.
The sculpture cook of Mysore has placed a sensitive issue before all of us.
If you ask them a question, they answer them.
And if we use it once then see what will be the use of it
And if there is a problem then please make a complaint to me.
Save water from every village.
How to save drops of water in the coming monsoon season
How will the water of the village remain in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our landscape due to over-exploitation of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spices, will you like to eat food
I don't like that food.
But today we have become unsuccessful in terms of TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on radio.
You must have thought of exams now.
I would like to join you in this journey.
The more you feel about your children's examinations, the more I feel.
But if we change our attitude towards exams then we can become anxious.
I had told you in the background of my Mann Ki Baat programme that send your experience and your suggestions to me on the Narendra Modi App.
I am glad that the teachers, the students who have achieved great success in their lives, the interested sections of the society have written and sent a lot of things to me.
Today, I want to talk to parents, students and teachers especially in Mann Ki Baat programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard, what I have read, what I have been told, what I feel about myself.
However, I am confident that my 25-30-minute interaction will be of immense use to those students who are going to face the test.
My dear students, before I talk to you, today's Mann Ki Baat has been started by a renowned Opener in the world. What will be the usefulness of those people in achieving success in their lives
Their experiences will definitely be useful for you.
I know that the examination will start in a few days.
Some of us may be under tension.
I have only one message.
Your parents, your parents, your teachers, other members of your family, you will keep your friends.
Wherever you go, what are you preparing for
How much quantity will you get
I had a lot of expectations when I was playing cricket.
Several difficult moments have taken place in the last 24 years and several times good moments have come.
But the expectations of the people used to be higher and the time spent on them increased as the time went on.
And for that I needed to find a solution.
At that time I thought that I had my own hopes and my own goals.
My attention was focused on Chandu and then all the goals were achieved from us.
Friends, What was Tendulkar saying
Don't be buried under expectations.
You have to shape your future.
Why should you waste your time in competing with others
You will see that no one can stop you from going ahead and if you succeed more than you have achieved it then you will not need to depend on someone else to enjoy it.
You will experience self-respect.
Friends, Exams should not be considered a game of qualities and statistics.
Where did you reach, how much did you achieve
Don't get stuck in this showback.
Can we know from these exams whether our speed is correct or not
And that is why if your dreams are universal and vast then exams will automatically be a festival of happiness.
And that is why what will happen this year, what will happen in this test
Do not limit yourself at all .
If you move ahead with a great goal before your eyes then you will not feel disappointed even if you get less than expected success. You will be inspired to strive harder and more.
Thousands of citizens have written and posted small issues on their mobile phones.
In fact, the entire year, 365 days, our daily routine, our dreams and concepts should be favourable.
Mr. Prabhakar Reddy addressed the gathering and wrote to me: Sleep on time and wake up early in the morning to illuminate the study.
Prabhakar Reddy said that the examination should reach the examination centre on time with admission letters and other essential things.
I don't have the courage to say this because I am not serious about sleeping.
And many of my friends complain that I am not taking enough sleep.
During the examination, I would like to talk to you people about sleeping so that you can examine yourself in a stress free state.
You will not do this .
I am sure you will not.
Being disciplined in life is a major reason for success to be strong.
Not only this, the daily routine also worsens.
And that is why don't understand anything small.
Decision, please.
The negative impact of the stress that exists under this stress falls on their results.
And on the strength of my studies, I will solve any question paper with confidence. Any question paper will be solved with determination.
Let us learn from them the way to achieve success by harnessing this scenario.
Hello, I Viswanathan Anand.
Let me begin by wishing you all the best for the exam.
I am going to share my experience about how I am going to go for my examination.
I realized that the exams are similar to the problems that come after you.
You should rest properly, you should have a quiet sleep at night, you should eat in your stomach, you must not be hungry. And the most important thing is that you should remain calm.
All this is the same as the left of the intellectuals .
Whenever you are playing, you dont know which steps will be taken in front of you. Similarly, you dont know in the class about which questions will be raised in the examination.
That is why if you remain calm and you have eaten all over your stomach , if you have had a good sleep then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
So it was calm.
Do not stress yourself much , do not expect too much .
It is important to look at this as a challenge. Would you like to invite me to the lessons that I have been taught in the year
Review the most important thing in the last moment, while recalling what you dont remember, you might recall some events along with the teachers or the students while examining and this will help you to remember a lot about that subject.
If you light up the problems that seem to be difficult then you will find that they are new questions for you. And then when you give your exams you will be able to solve them better.
So keep quiet, take a good night's sleep, do not show so much confidence, do not remain disappointed at the same time.
I have often seen that these exams are better than you were afraid.
And you must have seen them how they stand firmly while playing in the face of international warmth.
So it is difficult to say this but efforts should be made.
You don't talk to your friends, you go alone, you stay comfortable like a gallah, if you keep washing your books till the last moment then your mind will not remain calm.
If the water is calm then its extremely deep but if the surface of the water gets swollen then nothing is visible below .
At that time one feels the pressure inside .
Then I feel that it will be better if you take a little rest .
I have automatically developed a technology for that.
I breathe deeply, I breathe deeply, I breathe deeply thrice or five times.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this, but after that my mind gets calm and my mind is ready to understand the subject.
My experience will be useful for you as well.
Silver Agrawal has said a good story.
We should spend some time with our friends and families enjoying the lesser amount of time in writing on my app.
And what do you do
Friends, don't do that.
If you ever visit a place with your parents, then remember that moment, you must leave your studies and exams for at least half an hour.
Rajat ji asked him to understand the issue.
Friends, What will I tell you about Shanti
Today, before you give your exams, one such person has sent a message to you that those who are basically teachers and today they have become teachers in one way.
Ramcharit Manas has been trying to contribute to this great epic by connecting it with the present day.
The venerable Murari Bapu has narrated a slur for the students.
Friends, I would like to tell you one more thing today.
G.
But one thing is certain that be it the students' condition, Yoga is like a gurukilli in the journey to develop the second half of their lives.
You must pay attention to it.
But I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you have a lot of courage to go to the examination centre, don't you think that you should go to the examination centre and sit on your back
Otherwise there is tension in the mind .
If you understand that, you will not have time to repent.
I have also seen that the format of uestion Paper has changed.
In his message, Shri Rao highlighted the issue of patience.
At least in words, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb.
R.
Rao is saying this.
I am fully aware of the fact that due to exams, competitive exams also cause restlessness.
Don't be careful.
Give me your best, I would like to tell all my young friends.
At the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
You should decide what you want to do in your life and do not leave it alone.
Don't forget that you are the lacers of this world, you have the right to live here just like trees and mountains.
You need to be compassionate, dedicated and displayed.
With these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you all for whatever you have to do.
Many blessings.
In the past, how is a scientific method of telling the issue
It takes me half an hour to tell you in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children across the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination and diligence.
Friends standing firmly
If you stand steadfastly, you will also feel nervous.
And the golden future will wait for you to be grateful to you.
Ruchika Dabs has sent a message to me.
And it is true that Sachin ji also said that positive attitude, positive attitude of mind, positive energy.
Sometimes a lot of things that inspire us do not think that only the students get inspiration.
At any juncture of life, best generosity, truthful events inspire us too, they provide immense strength and they can pave the way for this inspiration in times of adversity.
We read about Thomas Alva Addison, the father of the lightning programme.
Friends, Have you ever thought about how many years they had spent in search of this thing Many times they had to fail, the time was spent and money was spent too much.
Though he did not take any special education in the field of mathematics, he laid emphasis on various fields such as mathematical classification, statistics etc.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this strength was important for him.
Today, the test is not only for the students but also for the families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal has said that the parents should not impose the burden of their expectations on the children.
And by looking at this we are not only bright but also fond of getting hand in hand with all that.
We also want to make progress at the rapid pace of science.
This is the reason why today is the National Science Day.
He proved to be the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And to commemorate that on 28 February, we celebrate National Science Day all over the country.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Every generation has to focus on scientific ideas and attract science and innovation.
New innovations are not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on National Science Day, new innovations should be encouraged across the country.
I am Sir C.
Friends, sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and whenever there is success then our vision of looking at the world changes.
You must have heard that in the past few days science has become a big and important discovery in the world.
Scientists from all over the world have worked hard, generations have come, they have spent some or some other time.
The theory of the great scientist Einstein of the last century was reinforced by this discovery, not only in the field of physics but also in the field of physics.
It is a matter of great benefit for the entire humanity.
We are particularly proud and happy to be an Indian who shared our sons and our skilled scientists in all these research processes.
Our scientists will try to take this new innovation forward in the coming days.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, recently an important decision has been taken in this regard.
The Government has decided to set up a Laser Interfameter Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India to reach the next level of discovery.
There are two such centres in the world, the third is India.
India's participation will give a new strength, a new momentum to this process.
India will actively participate in this noble scientific exploration of human welfare through limited resources.
My dear countrymen, I would like to tell you one number.
You will be able to hear the Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by giving a missed call to this number.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
The number of Missed Calls is 81908 81908.
Friends, I would like to give you the exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians will take my exam.
Bus, tomorrow I got the exam that you will start your exam.
And the country will succeed only when we all succeed.
Friends, I convey my best wishes to you.
Freedom from the stress of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind.
In the last Khepas Mann Ki Baat, I had said two things.
Recently we celebrated Christmas festival and have started preparations for a new year's reception.
India is full of diversity.
Festivals are celebrated with fanfare .
Sometimes it feels that India is a country where the economy is based on trade.
Whether it is terrorism or global warming, natural calamities or man-made, man-made, happiness and peace of all mankind
We know that I have been using technology in abundance. I get a lot of information from them.
I always see MyGov.
People go to different places to celebrate Christmas vacation.
In the tourism sector, special attention is given to all the facilities that are available to the tourists but Sawishwarkar says that where there are tourist places, dharamsalas and religious places, special attention should be paid to cleanliness.
And as a guest, we say, "Guest Devo Bhava", when guests come to our house then we clean the house and decorate the house.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to cleanliness in our tourist destinations and religious places.
Dilip Singh Malviya, an older artisan, lives in Bhojpura village in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh.
I had read it and I felt that it should reach you.
Dilip Singh Malviya, a resident of Chotyashya village, decided that if someone makes available toilets in the village then he will not accept the construction wages, he will free the construction of toilets.
Considering that construction of toilets is a sacred task, Dilip Singh built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Singh Malviya.
The country is making rapid strides because of the hard work done by many.
When every Indian realises that Sarah Jana Yoga is attracted to it, and the whole world celebrates International Yoga Day and when the whole world joins the world then we believe that it is our India.
When we see the universal form only then this belief, this feeling emerges in our minds.
Now the topic of cleanliness is being discussed at home.
Their participation will increase.
The government employees who have been working to provide electricity to the villages will be satisfied. They have been taking care of the transformation of the lives of a village. They will be happy that the farmers, the poor, the women and the youth will have to reach to all these things.
It is their right not to reach out to any government and no one has done any work so that they dont get it and they should reach there so that they do not lose it.
All of us should strive to ensure that the right things, good things, things that are useful for the common man reach them.
Doing so is a service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my behalf.
I can't do this alone, but when I tell you, I shouldn't do anything.
We have to reach out to 1. 25 billion Indians.
How can I reach without your help
We will inspire them to reach out to the common mans language and get their rights.
My young friends, in my address from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had made a preliminary discussion on the theme of Startup India Stand up India.
After that, the work has been started in every department of the government.
Can India be the world capital in terms of start-ups
Innovatively, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states be it manufacturing sector, service sector or agriculture.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments and new endeavours are needed and the world will not move forward.
Start-up India, Stand-up India is a great opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will present a complete action plan for the Start-up India Stand-up India scheme.
But not at all, we have to change it as per the requirements of India.
Our young friends are expected to innovate that a poor person labours, makes labour lighter and reduces suffering.
I also urge the State Governments to take the lead in this regard.
On 16th January, I will talk to you in detail.
I will always welcome your suggestions.
Dear young friends, 12th January marks the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, crores of people of this country have drawn inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival since 12th January, 1995.
This year, the programme will be held at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
I was told that this year's theme is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Hormoney.
He celebrated Excellent India Day, Ease of Doing Business Day in his school, and expressed his feelings on telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet such people who work in the society, there are many ideas in the minds.
Now it is true that every word has its own unique significance.
I was going to attend the Accessible India Campaign launched by the Government of India this year. However, I could not attend the programme of Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan because of my visit to Chennai in some districts of Tamil Nadu.
But I was thinking about going to that programme.
I felt like using the term 'Divyangjan' instead of the word 'Divyangjan' in our country.
These are those people who are close to or more than those who have divinity and divine power, who do not belong to people like us.
I liked this word a lot.
The people of my country will now prefer the word 'Divyangjan' instead of 'Divyangjan'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
Implementation of the necessary infrastructure, both directly and indirectly, will facilitate ease of living for the people with disabilities.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations have ramps, accessible parking, accessible carriages, brailleys, etc.
They like it.
We should also participate in it in our own way.
My dear countrymen, government schemes are continuously coming and going but these schemes are merely artificial intelligence and consciousness.
It should reach the last component in a good manner .
One should not digest his breath in files .
A few days back, the government of India made an effort to deliver the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the poor and to the needy.
Grant is given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is worth crores of rupees but we did not have the system to ensure that it did not reach the beneficiaries in the right time.
The government has made some changes in it.
The worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT) was implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account and Aadhaar Card and the amount of subsidy was credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I am proud to say that this initiative has got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds largest and most successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
The scheme is known as Pahal.
Nearly 15 crore LPG beneficiaries have become beneficiaries of Pahal by the end of November.
This subsidy has been directly credited to the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
No middleman, no one needs a recommendation, no corruption is possible.
On the one hand, Aadhaar card, Jan Dhan accounts on the other hand and on the other hand, the State Government and the Central Government are working together to create a list of beneficiaries and link them to Aadhaar number and Account Number.
A few days ago, MGNREGA provides employment opportunities in the villages.
There were several complaints regarding that.
I believe that nearly 35-40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a golden moment for the Republic Day of India.
The centenary year of Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary is the silver jubilee year.
A two-day special discussion was held on the Constitution in Parliament and it was done in an excellent manner.
All the parties discussed the importance of destruction, the importance of destruction and understanding the root cause of the destruction.
Can we connect people with power and power with people on the occasion of Republic Day
We have been given a lot of powers by the Constitution and it has to be discussed and done.
It is our sacred duty to cast votes on all four sides during the elections. It is written on the walls.
The way we talk about our duties during the polls, why not happen in our daily lives
As Babasaheb Ambedkar celebrated his 125th birth anniversary, on 26th January, what is the need of organising essay competitions, poetry competitions and essay competitions in schools, colleges, village bodies and societies in the city
If 1. 25 billion Indians move forward with a sense of duty, then a big history can be created.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your writings on my portal MyGov.
I would like to know what the young generation of my country thinks about their duties.
And I am not saying this at the government level.
We build the statues of great men with great devotion but we are sad to be careful afterwards.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also begun.
Festivals have a special significance in society.
Sometimes these festivals resonate with grief and sometimes create new ones.
But sometimes during these festivals if any problem arises then it becomes very painful.
Natural disasters are emerging from every corner of the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have ever heard or not.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
In our country, there has been heavy rains and droughts in the past few days and the way Tamil Nadu has suffered and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
My thoughts are with all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments work with all their strength in helping and rescue operations.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
Currently, a team of Government of India has visited Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis that has hit Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving forward with confidence and the role that he has played in the development of the country will be fulfilled.
But when we see the crisis around us, we need to bring about several changes in this thing.
Fifteen years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector, which was confined to natural calamities or droughts.
Today, its nature is changing.
At every level, we have to enhance our capabilities.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small and big institutions will have to work from the point of view of science.
After Nepal's earthquake, I interacted with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and suggested to him that we should jointly conduct a joint exercise to prepare ourselves for disaster preparedness.
I am glad that the workshop on SAARC countries was held in Delhi on the topic of seminars and best practices.
A good start has been made.
Lakhwinder Singh telephoned me from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
M Lakhwinder Singh speaks from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people about it.
I have a question that those people who set fire to cattle or goat plants do not know how to guide them about the death of micro-organisms in the soil and how to get rid of pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear Lakhwinder Singh's question.
Please be happy because you are a farmer organic farming and you are not only doing organic farming automatically but you also know the problems of the farmers very well.
Your anxiety is right but it is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people all over India and in a traditional way we burn the remains of crops in a similar way.
But the pain that you have expressed is correct .
The first step in this direction is to train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and explain to them the situation of truth that if the remains of crops are burnt then time and hard work will be saved and the fields will be ready for the next crops.
But this is not true.
We destroy them but if we make small pieces of these remains then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, it burns the surface of the ground after burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Just imagine for a while that your bones should be strong, your heart should be strong, your kidneys should be good, everyone should be alright but if the skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
We cannot survive even if the heart is alright.
The way in which the skin of our body burns it is difficult to remain alive similarly the peg of the crop not only burns but also burns the skin of the damp mother .
Animals can be utilized as fodder, their land is saved and if the fertilizer produced on that soil is placed on that soil then it will be of double benefit.
The water in those pits is sufficient for that crop and today their pits have also been valued.
They are now getting income from these pits.
Today the pits that had to be spent for sanitation were also a source of income and the demand for them is increasing.
Dear countrymen, the coming 3rd December will be celebrated as International Day of Persons with Disabilities all over the world.
27th November was observed as Indian Organ Donation Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and other eminent personalities participated in the event.
Organ donation can save many precious lives .
Organ donation provides immortality in a way .
When a part of one body goes into the other body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What could be a greater donation than this
A National Registration on Organ Teeth and Organ Transplant has been launched on 27th November, 2018.
I believe that there will be widespread awareness in this sector and in real terms it will provide the best possible support to the needy.
Like I said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally challenged person is also brave and capable .
When such individuals are neglected, they are neglected.
Sometimes they are shown kindness.
But if we change our attitude of looking at them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live a life.
They can inspire us to do something.
If we face a small crisis, we cry.
At that time, you will realise that the crisis on me is very small.
How can they live their lives
How do they do the work
And that is why all these things are inspiration for us.
This is the strength of their determination, their way of living and their strength to reverse the crisis with strength.
Today, I would like to mention about him that he is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Jawad Ahmad was shot in Kashmir by terrorists.
A part of the stomach and intestines has also been lost .
Manakya was severely damaged.
He always lost his power to stand on his feet, but Jawad Ahmad did not give up.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How can we develop facilities for handicapped persons in public places
They are working on these things.
Is it not enough to inspire every corner of the country
I specially remember the life and penance of Shri Javed Ahmad Ji and his dedication on 3rd December.
I can only mention Javad because there is little time but I am inspiring many such inspirations in every corner of the country.
They are illuminating life and showing new paths.
Be it the middle class, the junior middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the deprived or the deprived section of the society, they have constant relations with the government and the government system. And a citizen has sometime or the other experience of some or the other government employees and that evil experience changes his attitude of looking at the government system throughout his life.
But millions of people of this government work with dedication and service in such a manner that they never get in their sight.
Last year, both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates were awarded a joint Padma Vibhushan.
They do social work in India on a very large scale.
Whatever he has earned after his retirement, he is spending his entire life in working for the poor.
Whenever he comes to India, he appreciates the hopes he has got to work with and tells us how dedicated and hard he works.
He speaks of the zeal he has for learning innovative things.
A few days ago, the Government of Odisha honoured a hopeful worker on the Independence Day.
And Jamuna Manisingh, an hopeful worker from this village, decided that now I will not let anyone in Tedagaon die due to malaria.
If they go to every household and find out that there was a fever, they should reach there.
There will be many more such 'Jamuna Mani'.
There will be millions of people around us.
We met him with some respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How they become partners in the happiness and well-being of the society.
I would like to glorify all such ASHAs through Jamuna Mani.
My dear young friends, I am particularly active in the internet and social media for the younger generation.
Not only this, show them to others, it can happen that you will feel like adding something to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you all to participate in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Climate change and global warming are being discussed in a sensible manner. And now every work has started getting acceptance as a standard.
The temperature of the earth should not increase anymore.
It is the responsibility and care of everyone.
And the first way to prevent temperature rise is to save energy .
14th December is the National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Once I had said that on the full moon night, after closing the lamps on the streets, we should remain in the lunar light for hours.
You should experience the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur on television it felt that she did not get the opportunity to study much .
But she is doing such a thing that perhaps no one has ever thought about it.
It is brightening the lives of the poor by using solar energy.
She is fighting against darkness and shining her feet.
She has set up a committee of women and started a factory of solar powered tuberculosis plants and gave them a loan of Rs. 100 per month.
What kind of help is being provided to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earnings, empowerment.
However, the speed at which I am going to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has become good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that 24 lakh women out of 66 lakhs are from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes who have been trying to live up to their feet with dignity.
Abhishek himself has narrated the story of his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
Just a while ago someone told me that someone in Mumbai is a shailesh nasal.
During my cleanliness drive, I had said that the cleanliness mission is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and Shailesh Bhosle has shown them.
And I was told that in such a short span of time they have also returned two lakh rupees to the bank.
It is working on making potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor as much as possible.
Indeed, it is the economy of the country that runs.
Small scale industries are the economic power of the country's economy.
We have to give it more strength.
We have to do better but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had spoken of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should lead to sustained awareness in social life.
Efficiency under Rashtrayam Jagrayam Vyam is an award for freedom.
What should be the framework of the programme
I had asked you to send such information.
I was told that a lot of information was received.
But I expect more suggestions.
I expect a very special scheme.
There can be a lot of such things.
I believe that your suggestions will definitely be useful.
But I would like to urge you to exercise.
Definitely use this excellent season to keep body fit for exercise .
And if it is the season then we should also adopt the habit of climate.
Once again my countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
Once again I am visiting you through Mann Ki Baat.
The fifth one-day cricket between India and South Africa is being played.
The name of this Cricket Malike is Gandhi-Mandela series.
Both sides have won each other in two faces, and that is why the significance of the last meeting has certainly increased.
My best wishes to all my sports persons.
Today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur Akashwani.
I would like to convey my best wishes to the people of Kerala that when I started Mann Ki Baat, several people visited it. Among those 12th students of Kerala also joined the Shraddha Thamban.
I once again want to talk about Kerala.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School, Kochia Chittoor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
At the outset, I didn't understand why these kids made me a map of India with thumbs.
When I read his letter, I realized how he had given a very big symbolic message.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency .
Those girls have written to me in a letter asking people about organ donation through their Mann Ki Baat programme.
The 80 year old Vasantrao Sudke Guruji from Maharashtra has started a continuous movement.
He says organ donation should be a festival .
I also receive a lot of messages from the phone.
Devesh from Delhi has conveyed a message to me.
I believe that this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people need kidney, heart and liver every year in our country.
But in our country with the population of 125 crore only five thousand transplants organ transplantations take place .
Every year one lakh eye lashes are needed but only 25 thousand people get eyes .
When we need four eye lashes then we can only give one eye.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have done a great job in speeding up the efforts of organ donation by reducing paperwork.
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
Very social organisations, Very NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
Ten Tatkten Bhunjitha means the joy in sacrifice is best.
Last month we all had watched on TV that it was Delhi's G.
Saved a life.
Dear countrymen, we have celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
After a few days we will celebrate Diwali.
Eid was celebrated, Ganesh Chaturthi was celebrated.
However, we will feel proud of the fact that we will celebrate another festival among them.
India-Africa Foreign Summit will be held in New Delhi from 26-29 October 2019.
This is going to be the first such event in India.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The population of Africa is equal to the population of India.
If both the populations unite, one-third of the worlds population will be.
And it is said that millions of years ago, the territories of both the countries were united.
Later, the Indian Ocean divided the region into two parts.
And look, it is our endeavour to unite and unite the people.
On this occasion, the Government of India has organized a massive programme by the HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was held in the schools where CBSE had affiliated schools, an essay competition was held, a programme of poem writing was organised and everyone participated.
About 1600 schools participated.
It included schools outside India and India, and thousands of school children wrote about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the exhibition "Memories of Mahatma" from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, which is a mobile exhibition, will travel from Porbandar to Northern State and reach Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of school children visited the exhibition and people from villages also witnessed the exhibition.
People came to know about the great role Mahatma Gandhi played in the relations between Africa and India, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on these two lands.
Although there is an Indo-Africa Summit but I can see that this is an opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate Garmala and the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and HRD Ministries.
On 15th August, I had made a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
A workshop was organised in Bhopal last month wherein the heads of the Adarsh Grams, collectors of the Adarsh Grams, some MPs of the Adarsh Grams Yojana, the Government of India and the State Governments had discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana in detail.
How new things were noticed, some encouraging things were noticed.
He has selected Parsi Gram Panchayats from Kunti Districts of Jharkhand for the ideal village.
In this Parsi village of Jharkhand, an effort was made to make people-centric along with infrastructure and systems in the ideal village.
I congratulate the Honourable Member of Parliament Shriman Kriya Mundanji.
Thus, I received a news from Andhra.
Ashok Gajapati, MP from Andhra Pradesh, spent a lot of money in Rajuji Adarsh Gram Yojana and chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat of Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh as ideal village.
Nearly 550 adult illiterates were educated and literate.
See, there is no budget, no circular, no specific system in the society, however, what a big change is brought about due to will power can be seen through Gram Panchayat.
Our honoured Parliamentarian Shriman C.
L. Ruwala, an MP from Mizoram.
He has chosen the Khavalahilang village as an ideal village.
This village is very popular for sugarcane production and jaggery.
How to make the village an economic hub, how to market the village products
Ruvalaji, who tried to build a self-reliant village along with an ideal village, deserves these congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, Mann Ki Baat. And when will there be no talk of cleanliness
I would like to remind you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media had launched a special campaign, where the crackers had cracked after Diwali, all those things had been shown to the public on the channel.
Before the festivities, we are concerned about the accidents that do not happen, but we should do it even after the festivities.
And I would like to especially congratulate the media of India for this thing.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I participated in the Swachhta Sammelan by India Today Group to mark one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
I was looking at the measurements given by them in Clean India Awards.
How are people working like One Life, One Mission for this
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean
Ever since the launch of Swachhta Mission, I have seen that the e-Nadu of Andhra Telangana, especially Shriman Ramuji Rao, is very old at the age of age, but his enthusiasm is embarrassing to any youngster, not less than a young man.
He added about 51 lakh children in 55-56 schools in Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places or stations or religious places or parks, a massive campaign related to cleanliness has been started at several places.
Now this news shows the strength to fulfil this dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News launched this programme called Bharat Desh Hai Mera. And there was awareness about cleanliness among the people and worked to educate the countrymen.
NDTV has launched a campaign called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shriman Shanmukh Nathan has written a letter to me to mention the village of Mavalyanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past few years this village has taken up the task of cleanliness.
It is said that almost every generation is dedicated to this cleanliness. A few years ago, he was awarded the Cleanest Village in Asia.
And it is important that we all have to believe that our country will be clean and it will be done with the efforts of the countrymen. When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, with pride, 100 crore countrymen can say it with pride.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said this thing from the Red Fort, there are a few things where corruption has brought home.
We hear all these stories and this is the reason why I was thinking about the need for interviews for small jobs.
I have never heard of such a psychologist in this world who can recognize a person completely by taking him in one or two minutes .
And with this idea, I had announced that we will stop the practice of interviewing for this small job.
My dear young friends, today I would like to say with pride that the government has completed all these processes and the recruitment of Group D, Group C and Group B posts of the central government will not be discussed.
The Rule will come into force from 1st January, 2016 and where recruitment process is in progress, we will not afford it, but will come into effect from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become an important part of social life.
Gold can become power, gold can become economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will pay you interest on it just as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier, we used to keep gold in the locker and used to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep it in gold bank and the bank will pay you interest.
Now the countrymen cannot wealth of gold
The second thing is that in Sovereign Gold Bond this bond is a paper but the value of that paper is gold.
You will get back as much money as the price of gold on the day of repayment.
I am glad to say that we are bringing the Gold ueen.
It has been almost 70 years since the independence of the Gold ueen that brought Ashoka Chakra, but till date we have been using the Foreign Gold ueen.
Gold Billion Bonds are also used abroad.
We are also going to make it available to the common man before Dhanteras in the coming weeks, we are going to start a golden coin with Ashoka Chakra of five grams and ten grams.
Along with this 20 grams of gold will be made available to the people .
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel reminded us of the map of India.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is full of many sects, sects, dialects, diversity, diversity and diversity. And this diversity is our glory and beauty.
If there is no diversity then we cannot take pride in these beauty and beauty.
Therefore, it is the mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, on 31st October, RAN-For Unity programmes are being organised in every corner of the country.
The 'Run for Unity' is also the race for development in true sense.
Pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take the mantra of unity forward.
Brothers and sisters, Now if you are preparing for Diwali then the house will be cleaned.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in our country in different forms.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Burning sensation starts because of cracks and cracks damages the children a lot .
I would like to tell every parent that the joy of Diwali is looted but do not accidentally happen, the loss of the child in our family is not there and you have to think about it and you have to do it.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain on the second day of Diwali.
The government of India and the state governments provide scholarships to those dalits, tribals, backward classes of the society who go abroad for their studies.
I believe that when our children will be educated in the UK then the place of Baba Saheb will become an inspiration. Babasaheb has given this message to the country that he has learnt something in his life.
You can guess how much happiness this building will make the wealth of 1. 25 billion countrymen and the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be added.
I will get another opportunity in London, I want to unveil the statue of Lord Visvesvara.
It is essential for the world to study the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy and for the Employment of Women several years ago.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visvesvara on the land of London is a great example of how the great personalities of India had thought and visioned several years ago.
My dear countrymen, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
He was interacting with Government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn so many languages
But I am grateful to All India Radio for broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in every state at 8 pm.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all.
Jai Hind.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to talk to Mann Ki Baat for the first time on October 3.
Peoples power is of immense importance in democracy.
There is a basic idea in my life and therefore I have full faith in the power of the people.
But what I learned from Mann Ki Baat, what I learned, what I experienced, I can say that the people's strength is much more than that.
Our ancestors used to say that Jan Dhan is a part of God.
From the experiences of Mann Ki Baat, I can say that there is a great power in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I used to ask the people for Mann Ki Baat and I used to ask only two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people actively sent information.
This is a great strength.
When people were looking at it, they also felt that the feeling of sadness and misery towards the daughters will have to be changed.
It was a silent revolution.
Incredibly India, Incredibly India, Incredible India, you send a picture of your tourism on the gallery, I will see it.
People from every part of India have sent photographs in lakhs.
The tourism departments of the government of India or the state government would never have had such a rich legacy with us.
Everything came on one platform and no government expenditure was spent on it.
People did this.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
I used to say this thing in Mann Ki Baat that the poor households used to be drunk, the children used to cry, the poor mothers used to be drunk.
Do they not want to get gas cylinders
If the government works hand-in-hand with this society then the government can work as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small issue was considered a small issue and tried to connect itself for the welfare of the country.
What could be a greater pleasure than this .
I decided to do a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I requested the citizens of the country to send your questions, your suggestions and your proposals to me through telephone.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad that more than 5,500 telephones have been received from all over the country be it Sichin, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is not a single country in India from which the citizens have not made a phone call.
It is a pleasant experience.
The citizens of all age groups shared their views.
I have heard some of them by myself. My team works on proposals on other issues.
You might have taken a couple of minutes to make this telephone, but for me, the relevance, ideas and issues received from it are important.
The entire government will definitely work on this thing.
What is the importance of radio for such blind people
I can see from a new perspective. And many good things, good issues and issues that he has said are enough to sensitize the government.
I would like to inform Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that this time through Mann Ki Baat, the people of India should make maximum use of soil fertilizers in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the Armed Forces for two-three hours.
Naval forces and Air Force protecting the skies of water, land and skies.
The 1965 war with Pakistan marked fifty years.
We just heard about the pride, the moments of pride, the moments of pride, the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers. However, the techniques of photographing and cinema were not available at that time.
Whether it is Hajifire or be it the North or the leather, the sight of the victory achieved near the Hajipir Pass thrills the body and the pride awaiting the Indian Army comes to mind.
If you want to create history then you will have to understand the small issues of it.
History keeps our bonds with our children.
If history breaks the bonds then it is possible to create history.
A child has given an order to the Prime Minister but he forgot to mention the name of the son himself in Ghaighai.
On 2nd October, I announced the campaign for Swachh Bharat. And I can tell you that for the first time after Independence, discussions on cleanliness in the Parliament are going on.
Our government was also criticised.
I also had to hear a lot about cleanliness. Modiji used to talk a lot about cleanliness but what happened
I don't feel bad because of this, but it shows me a good thing that India's cleanliness is being discussed in the country's parliament.
And on the other hand, on the one hand, when both the MPs and the children of the country talk about cleanliness then there can be no such thing for the country.
This is a movement that is spreading awareness about filth and cleanliness.
This will also make the government functional, it will be inevitable to do the work and act.
In 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we will work in that direction to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
We know what Mahatma Gandhi says.
At one place, he said that when it comes to choosing one of the two freedom fighters and cleanliness, I will give priority to cleanliness and cleanliness was more important for Gandhiji since independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi, MyGov.
My dear countrymen, the life of the great men continues to inspire us.
This evaluation is not a work of yours.
All those who live for the country and die for the country are those who inspire us.
This is a day to remember all these great souls.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jayprakash Narayan ji on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
Whatever date you take, from the point of view of history, the names of some or the other great person will be linked to that date.
I once again urge you for the 2nd of October.
On 2nd October, the venerated Bapu ji marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by spending a lot of money on advertisements is due to your small actions.
And that is why I once again urge you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all the arrangements with the virtue of Subhas Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took up this task and in the last week there was a strong news that more than 50 of Subhas Babu's family would come to the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
He will often get an opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence by meeting Netaji for the first time.
But more than that, I am glad that there will never be such a hospitality in the Prime Minister's residence that I will be fortunate to do in the month of October.
More than 50 brothers and sisters of Subhas Babu, family members and people of different countries will be able to face all these challenges.
How happy it will be for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make the younger generation aware about voter registration so that the participation of the youth can increase in the coming days and the younger generation can collaborate in choosing and running the government in the future.
I hope that those youngsters who have not yet registered their electoral rolls will register and vote for them.
Kshitij Pandey, a 7th student, who is a student of Anars Hindu University, is a student of 7th standard in Kendriya Vidyalaya.
Danda is confident about it.
And when I saw her interest in physics at this young age, I would feel that she was reading a lot.
The daughter of Sadavat Patel, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi.
Her father said, "No, if we take up all the three books of mathematics, then in the evening when we open the mouthpieces, history, Saran magnifies.
All of us are surprised to know that I was very impressed.
Sometimes such kids get familiar with them, but I don't know anything about Sonam.
I am told that God has given me a strength.
I got the opportunity to meet two children during my visit to Kashi.
Similarly, the visit of these two children will be remembered by me.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people suggest new things to me.
See what Sandeep of Haryana can say - Sandeep Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat once a month, please do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration to hear your words.
Sandeep ji, what do you do with me
Once in a month, I have to do a lot of things, I have to make a plan in time.
I am staying once a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year in a way.
You know how to use Subhashbabu radio
He had started his radio station from Germany and had to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement from this radio station.
He had launched the Azad Hind Radio a weekly report.
These radio broadcasts from English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Parsi, Urdu and other languages.
It has now taken me one year to communicate Mann Ki Baat from AIR.
Keep sending your suggestions, ideas and proposals.
It also benefits the government.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution, your participation is valuable and precious.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Citizens of South India are drenched in the festival of Onam and just yesterday, the entire country celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan.
Keeping in mind the social security issues, the Government of India has launched several new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that all of you have accepted this scheme in a short span of time.
I had requested my sisters to visit these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, 11 crore families have been linked to them. And I have been told that almost all these schemes have benefitted mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, when I was talking to you, it took one year to complete the Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Banking sector is also an important part of the economy and Bank Mitra Yojana has been strengthened to ensure that this system reaches the houses of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Youth have also got employment.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, 1 lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
We cannot just open accounts and stop them.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under the Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also got the facility.
It is a belief that the poor can get the money from the bank.
Once again I congratulate all of you and I would like to urge the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters of the poor to keep your bank accounts intact.
This bank is yours. Don't leave her now.
I have brought the bank to you. Now it is your job to keep it safe.
And it is natural that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country gets the first blow.
But in a very short span of time, all my brothers and sisters of Gujarat have brought the situation under control.
And once again Gujarat started moving on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood are the right path and shoulder to shoulder while walking on the path of development.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet scholars from the Sufi sect.
I got the opportunity to listen to his thoughts and tell you the truth, I felt like listening to some music.
I came to speak to the scholars about their choice of words, their manner of speaking, their generosity and generosity in the Sufi tradition, which has a rhythm of music.
I was very impressed.
Often there is a need for Islam to reach out to the world in its true form.
The Sufi sect that has been associated with love and generosity will reach far and wide, which will benefit the human society, Islam will also benefit. And I would like to tell others that we should understand the Sufi sect, Sufi sect, Sufi tradition.
And I am fortunate to have got this invitation in the coming days.
Scholars from Buddhist traditions from all over the world will come to Bodh Gaya in India and will discuss the welfare of humanity and global issues.
I am glad that I got the invitation to visit Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that I will get the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya along with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Today, I would like to reiterate my heartfelt condolences.
I had already placed this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in my speech in Parliament, in public meetings, in Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I was saying this thing that the Government of India is open to the issue of land acquisition law.
This means that the situation that was there before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us.
This mantra is for the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August, we had said that not only the Agriculture Department but the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are implementing this decision immediately.
Two days before the war of 1965, 50 years were completed and when the theme of 1965 emerged, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was commemorated.
I salute and salute all those who have won India in the war of 65 years.
Such events in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi sect last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to meet the renowned scientists from all over the country and interact with them for hours.
I am happy to learn that India is doing excellent work in the field of science in many directions.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it was not only an inspiration for me but also an inspirational learning.
And I saw how many young scientists were talking with zeal and so many dreams were visible in their eyes.
Last time I had told Mann Ki Baat that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting I feel that there are immense possibilities, there are immense possibilities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends should look at science and inspire students for it.
I have written about skill development.
Shri Prakash from Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu has stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I would particularly like to tell my young friends one thing.
On 15th August, in a speech from the Red Fort, I had said that why this interview is for lower level jobs
And when letters come for interview then every poor family, widow comes to the thinking that who will get the recommendation, who will get the job
I dont know what words are used
And perhaps, corruption at the grassroots level should be one of the reasons.
I had said in my August 15 speech that even for this low level election, the Seminar of Interpretation does not apply to him. And I am happy to say that the government has taken very fast steps in this direction that it has taken only 15 days in such a short span of time.
Recommendations are being sent and the decision not to keep an eye on small posts is going to be implemented now.
Unfortunately, about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die in our country every year after delivery and immediately after delivery.
This is worrying and horrific .
There has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers, our newborn babies.
We watch television broadcasts but we dont pay attention. And the advertisements come from the newspapers but we don't see.
Along with clean water, it is essential to keep small things clean at home.
Life is very valuable.
Neglecting waste water, sadness towards hygiene is not the reason for death.
Dengue tests are freed at around 514 centres across the country.
The period from Rakshabandhan to Diwali is a period of many festivals in our country.
Please associate each of our festivals with cleanliness and see that the quality of cleanliness will come automatically in your nature.
I have always said that you will not get the opportunity to sacrifice your lives for the country but you will get the fate of living for the country.
Two youngsters from our country, two brothers from Maharashtra, Dr.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Morocco.
This is how everyone is trying to take the country forward and this is the reason that it is a matter of pride and pride.
Sometimes because of lack of understanding, we do injustice to our youth.
But my experience is different in terms of youth.
Sometimes we learn and learn new things by talking to them.
I have also met a number of youngsters who used to tell me that I have been doing this sound on cycle.
Some are determined to cycle one day in a week.
He said that everyone can enjoy being better and younger for health and environment.
The attacks in our country encourage many people to increase the number of cyclists in many homes.
I am happy to note that these are good efforts to save the environment, to maintain health and today two youngsters of my country have unfurled Indias flag in the United States.
I specially congratulate the government of Maharashtra today.
This memorial will inspire us to work for the oppressed, exploited, persecuted and underprivileged.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that have honoured Dr. Ambedkar.
We can take the country forward by putting shoulder to shoulder.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
This will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters in the field of Kharif.
And I remembered one more thing that pleased my mind.
Our country has always been deprived of rice and oilseeds.
The poor man gets stubble, there is slight oil for food and vegetables.
I am glad that the food grains that have been produced this year have increased by 50 and oilseeds production by nearly 33.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, July 26th has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The farmers belong to the same land as the soldiers of this country.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers broke down on hundreds of our enemies.
Kargil war was not just a battle fought across the border but every city and every village of India participated in it.
The fight for a sister was fought for those mothers whose younger son was fighting the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters fought this war, their brave young boys, their fathers, their fathers, those who had not yet learnt to walk.
It is because of the sacrifices made by all of them that India can speak to the world in a big way today.
In just a few months after our government came to power in 2014, we launched the MyGov campaign on 26th July.
We have launched this website to engage every citizen in development and to increase their participation in democracy.
And today, after one year, I am glad to say that about two crore citizens have visited MyGov website.
About 5. 5 lakh citizens reacted and in particular, more than 50 thousand citizens took time out for the PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right for such people to take out the ticket of the train
However, this thing looks smaller on top but the government didn't even remember it.
However, the government seriously considered the issue of Akhilesh and today a separate system has been implemented for the reservation of tickets for our disabled sisters.
A new logo is created, a two-line is created, a programme strategy is formulated, a lot of positive suggestions are received on MyGov.
It is realized that there are new waves in the governance system.
A new consciousness is being felt.
MyGov's suggestions have begun on 15th August for which issues I would like to address in my speech.
Sumitra Raghav Chari from Chennai has suggested a lot.
I would like to assure the citizens of the country that what should be in my speech on 15th August.
I am sure you will make good suggestions.
I take care of one thing and it reaches you.
I don't want to preach to anyone, I don't intend to get rid of the responsibilities of the central government, state government or local body.
Just two days ago, I witnessed an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was in a state of wound for about ten minutes.
Hoshakote Akshay from Bengaluru, Amay Joshi from Pune, Happy Kakunje from Murbidari in Karnataka, many others have expressed their concern on this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in a road accident.
But I urge the parents that their children should be able to drive a two-wheeler, that they should teach them about four-wheeler, safety and security, that they should get from their homes, from their families and parents should pay attention to them.
In this regard, the government has come up with several new policies and initiatives to train the citizens about road safety, road mapping mechanisms or to provide immediate relief to the accident victims.
Keeping all these things in mind, we will introduce the Traffic and Safety Bill.
We intend to take several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
This is a cashless treatment scheme from Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, Yeth to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondiya highways.
This means that we will prioritise the accident victims to get immediate medical aid within 50 hours of the accident. Whether it is nearer to pay attention to them immediately or not, who will pay the bill.
Toll-free telephone number 1033 will be available all over the country to facilitate the patients to know about the accident.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there will be no accident in the root because one life and everyone's life are more important.
Sometimes I say that the worker should become a karmayogi.
In the last few days, I had come across a few things and I felt like talking to you about them.
But how to bring consciousness to the work done by them
Vijay Biswal showcased how he combines his talent with his work.
There is a possibility that his picture will be discussed now and I got to know about one more thing.
I was touched by the entire team of government officials of the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, a separate campaign launched by the Sangh.
I liked his work, these officers started the campaign Operation Malayuddha and you would feel that something is different.
But it is important that he gave a new dimension to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
There is a sportsperson named Keshla near Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village worked hard to build toilets.
Now no one in this village goes to the open for defecation and when the work of constructing toilets is complete then a festival should be celebrated and Keshla village celebrated with joy.
These are the best examples of how the values of social life change, how the mindset of the people changes and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written about questions related to North Eastern Region.
However, the people of North-Eastern region are active.
They will go to the village and interact with the officials of the administration and the people and the citizens.
You will know their problems and you will do whatever is possible by the central government to solve these problems.
A good effort is being made to move away from Delhi to the East, what I say is the Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of the Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and happiness for all of us.
We know this news but we don't pay attention to it.
I would like to urge the IAS officers of the government to visit a school or college for about two to four hours a week and interact with the students there.
This is a difficult task but we have to do it.
There is no electricity during the examination and therefore do not fall into the education of children.
If you want to start a small business in the village then there will be electricity.
At some places, one has to go to another village to charging mobile phones.
We have started this thing and we will certainly do it.
Today, I felt like talking to you on different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to you all for this.
You must send your suggestions and ideas for the 15th of August and I will certainly be useful.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I used to feel that there is something less.
In a simple environment, as a family member of 130 crore Indians, we used to hear a lot of things and I used to repeat a few words.
Sometimes your own things were becoming an inspiration for our people.
You can imagine how this mid-day holiday might have been.
Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - at 11 a.m.
I feel like missing something every moment.
And whenever I talk about Mann Ki Baat, even then I would speak alone. And the words may be mine, the voice may be mine, but that story is yours, Purushartha is yours.
I used only my words and my speeches.
There was a feeling of absolute vacuum in the mind.
Once the elections are over, please come in and talk about four things.
But later I thought that no.
It is our Sunday programme and it should continue.
However, this Sunday was a very long wait.
Small but simple things are also causing change in the life of the society.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in a way we have to move ahead with this sequence by giving strength to the consciousness of a New India.
He said that in the last few months, many messages have been received, and innumerable people are missing the Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I read this message, I feel really upset.
This is my visit from Aham to Yama.
This silent dialogue with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual experience.
Several people have asked questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the Dham Dhumi of elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also be curious to know the answers to these questions.
I believe that I had got the opportunity to fill this vacancy in the valleys of Kedar, in the solitary cave.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar's visit, your effort to strengthen a positive thing and I feel continually impressed by your speech.
The letters that come for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are available, are different from the routine of the day-to-day government.
Sometimes the letters you have sent will also become a reason for inspiring me.
In some cases, you do something to strengthen my thinking process.
I understand the challenges facing the country and the society.
At the same time, people also tell us the answers to these problems.
I can see that in the letters people put their problems and also write about the answers that they have.
The answers to the questions, some or the other innovative ideas, directly or indirectly reflect.
Mann Ki Baat is like an embodiment for the country and society.
Today my heart is filled with joy.
I had said the last time that I had met in the last three-four months, some people had given a political meaning to that thing and they had said: Oh, how much confidence Modi Ji has, how much confidence he has.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your belief.
You all were believing.
And that is why I had said in Akher's Mann Ki Baat that I will come to talk to you after a few months.
And you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
If we move forward with this feeling then we should continue the sequence of Mann Ki Baat as before.
Movement was not limited to prison.
There was an aggression in the hearts of people.
Democracy was a flaw in the minds.
Whenever you get food during the time, you dont know what hunger means.
Likewise, whenever he shares the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country feels that during the Emergency, there was something that was going on.
Even if someone snatches away from us the same thing that we have never used, the same pain and suffering.
Democracy has embodied some of the systems that have been created in India's Constitution.
There is also a need for a reduction in running the social system.
Laws, rules and regulations are also required, rights and duties are also discussed.
However, India's pride and pride can say that for us the values of democracy are greater than the laws and the rules.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage and our tradition.
And with this legacy, we have grown into a small one.
Therefore, the country had sacrificed an entire election not for us, but for the protection of democracy.
We can easily take home the precious democracy that we have got.
More than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if the world's share of democracy comes to mind then I would like to say that if one quit China then more than the population of any other country, more people have voted in India.
The number of voters polled in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States.
There are more voters in India than the population of the entire Europe.
You can imagine how much resources and human resources are required to fulfil this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff worked hard day and night to cross the elections.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have fulfilled their responsibilities to make this great sacrifice of democracy a success.
Besides, 20 lakh police personnel from different states have also worked hard.
You can imagine the vastness of the total election.
This was done so that not a single voter remains deprived of his powers but all the eligible voters are entitled to vote.
In the remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, they were setting up a polling booth for a woman voter.
You will be pleased to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two days to reach that difficult place.
Besides, there was one thing to say pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission of India and to all those who have participated in this election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard from me that I urge you not to book book books
We all can give books instead of flowers while welcoming them.
Now people have started welcoming books in many places because of this.
I had recently received a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniyan'.
I liked this gift.
However, I have not been able to get a lot of time but I got the opportunity to revisit some of his stories during the journey.
Premchand ji, in his stories, painted the realities of the society, while reading them, the pictures of that period were in front of us.
Every detail, everything he wrote keeps alive.
His stories seem to incorporate the spirit of the whole of India.
While reading the story Nasha written by him, my mind rushed to the question of economic disparity in society.
I remembered the time when I was young.
The economic disparity of the society was negotiated by our youth overnight.
In this story, the sensitivity of a child, the immense sensitivity of his mind, the maturity of thoughts at such a young age.
When a 4-5 year old Hamid comes to his place with a glimpse of the fair then in real terms human sensitivity reaches a great height, in the end it will make the reader extremely emotional.
In this story, a lively picture of the lives of a poor farmer can be read.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated in the dense forest of Idukki.
The Primary Teacher, P.
Murulidharan and a small tea shopkeeper P.
V.
Chinnathampi, both of them worked tirelessly and started the library.
There was a time when these two books were made and books were taken from their backs in their villages in the forest.
Today this library is working to show a new direction to everyone along with the tribal children of this place.
Gujarats mission of Gujarat has succeeded well.
Millions of people from all walks of life participated in this campaign and read books.
In today's digital era, during the times of Google Guru, I urge you to take some time to save books from your daily routine.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are not only thinking about the present times but also considering the future challenges.
When I was reading your reactions on Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I realized that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related to water.
The water is equal to the mother and the mother blesses her and the blessings of the mother-in-law should be upon her.
Due to the deficiency of water in many parts of the country there is drought every year .
We save only eight percent of the water, hence now we need to solve this problem.
Just as we have found answers to many other problems through peoples participation, peoples power, similarly 30 crore Indians will find solutions to the problem of water with all their capabilities, with all their support and determination.
Considering the importance of water itself, the country is now setting up a new Jal Shakti Ministry.
This will enable faster decision making on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to do something at a slight pace.
I have written letters to the Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans across the country.
In order to save water, to store water, do not drop drops of rain or to save rain water, the village heads should convene meetings.
A pledge has been made to save every drop of water in every village and to save rain water.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpada.
The people of that place have once again proved to play an active role in conserving water.
I convey my best wishes to all the Village Prime Ministers, to all the Sarpanches who have shown their vigour to save water.
Several sarpanches across the country have made such a solemn pledge to conserve water.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of that village are now in the race to build a water temple in their own villages.
I have already said that collective efforts will have very positive results.
There cannot be a single formula to overcome water conservation across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But the goal is one and that is water conservation, water conservation.
Work is underway to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water logging.
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the construction of water tanks at Thimpalli in Telangana.
Small ponds made in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a major change.
I had read about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women came together to revive the Naga river.
I read that the women of Garhwal are working together in a very good way for rainwater harvesting.
I believe that when we all work together and strive hard, it becomes impossible.
When everyone will be involved in water conservation, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to insist on three things for the countrymen.
My first insistence is that just as the countrymen have made the cleanliness campaign a movement, similarly, a mass movement should be started for water conservation.
Let us collectively pledge to save every drop of water and I am confident that the water is the Prasad given by God.
Earlier people used to say that the touches of Paris used to be made of iron ore.
I say that water is periphery and Paris means water is creating a new life.
An awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water .
Make the society aware and connect the society.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of venerated Bapu, he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of venerated Bapu.
And that is why I often say that if someone goes to the Kirti temple then he must see the storage of water.
Come, let us motivate people for water conservation by making a list of maximum water conservation practices.
You can share your knowledge in JanshaktiforJalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you for one more thing.
He told me through Twitter how Presidents, Prime Ministers, dignitaries and ordinary citizens across the world celebrated Yoga Day in their respective countries.
On that day the whole world was feeling happy and happy.
Therefore, propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service.
Wouldn't such serving be recognised and honored
The Prime Ministers Award for Outstanding Contribution to Promotion and Development of Yoga was announced in 2019.
This thing is inspiring.
Now this is the issue of Yoga. Indians are not far behind in this field.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honoured, which has been dedicated to the cause of Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, our journey is beginning today, new feelings, new resolutions and new strengths, but I will continue to wait for your good wishes.
Come, let us continue to meet and speak.
I listen to your feelings and keep my mind alive.
Sometimes I try to revive that feeling.
Your blessings will continue to be so.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again, I will visit Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terror attack in Pulwama, and expressed anguish over the loss of lives of the people of India.
Condolences are being extended to the brave soldiers and their families who were martyred.
The feeling of deep anguish over such violent acts of terrorism lies in the minds of all of us and myself. The same feeling lies in the hearts of every countrymen and in the hearts of humanity and in the hearts of all the humanity around the world.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown exceptional courage and valour.
Where they have shown unprecedented capability to establish peace.
He has also tried to give a befitting reply to the attackers in his own language.
You must have seen how action was taken within a hundred hours.
The courage shown by the father of Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar in such a sad event is an inspiration for all of us.
In order to fight the enemy, we will send our second son to the army and if necessary, we will fight ourselves.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, the wife of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also decided to recruit one of his only children in CRPF.
When Gumla village in Jharkhand reached the body of Martyr Vijay Shoren, wrapped in a tricolor, his ex-sided son said that he too is going to join the army.
It is the spirit of every child of India that has shown these innocent children.
This feeling is reflected in the houses and the houses of our brave martyrs.
There is no exception to one of our brave martyrs that their family is no exception.
Whether it is the family of Martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria or the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kanchenjunga or the six-year-old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyred soldiers is inspiring.
We dont need to look at the old events of history to know what is sacrifice.
These are examples of conversation in front of our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for India's bright future.
My dear countrymen, you people have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for several years.
Therefore, it is natural for the countrymen to have curiosity and curiosity in their minds.
Shri Yut Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi in Karnataka on the Narendra Modi App, expressed happiness that the work on the National War Memorial has been completed.
This memorial is a place to preserve the saga of the great valour of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to build such an inspirational monument in the country.
We decided to set up the National Military Memorial and started the actual work.
Tomorrow, on 25 February, this National Military Memorial will be handed over to millions and millions of our countrymen.
The country will make a very small effort to repay its debts.
This new memorial is being built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti, the place where the heart of Delhi was called.
I am confident that this National Military Memorial will have the vision of the countrymen for such a sacred task as to visit a place of pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of gratitude for the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice since independence.
The construction of this memorial is an exhibition of the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The theme of the National Military Memorial is based on four concentrated cycles, ranging from the birth of a soldier to the martyrs.
The Jyoti of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldiers.
The defence cycle that follows is reflecting security.
There are queues of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are a symbol of the soldiers and give a message of confidence to the citizens of the country that every moment the soldiers are stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Whoever comes here with the aim of knowing the bravery of these brave soldiers will be able to know about the bravery of those brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces, in words of great and invaluable contribution to the development of the country, is indeed impossible.
I would like to express our gratitude to the men and women police personnel who are continuously working for our security.
I hope that all of you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
It will inspire others to visit this sacred place and will also be eager to visit this sacred place.
Whenever I was reading the reaction I had received from you, my heart was filled with a funny response by Shri Ashok Mukhopadhyay Ji.
He writes that on March 3, 1900, the British attacked Birsa Munda.
And it is a matter of Yoga that on 3rd March this year also marks the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
Both of them have come from different family backgrounds, but they have enriched the traditions, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat in a way is a tribute to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brightened the name of not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters can be named as inspirational personalities as guides, it is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British caught Birsa Munda while she was asleep.
Do you know why the British had to adopt the path of mischief to catch Munda
The reason was the fear of the British Munda who created such a massive empire.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional blessings, had completely destroyed the British Government with guns and cannons.
In fact, if people get such an inspiring leadership then the collective will become stronger than the strength of the armed forces in front of the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda not only fought with the British for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done everything in their short life.
The darkness of the deprived and the exploited brought light into the darkness of life.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed at the age of 25 years.
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have been born in every part of the country.
Unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If a personality like Lord Birsa Munda has made us realise the existence then a personality like Jamshedji Tata has created a very big institution in the country.
Jamshedji Tata knew that India must become the hub of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Not only this, he established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda ji had once met on board the ship during their visit to the United States.
The foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science (IISE) was laid through this interaction.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29 February.
We all know that this date comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, a simple personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget for the most time in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai took a skilled leadership of India during the time of the country's democratic crisis.
Morarjibhai Desai embraced the movement against the Emergency to protect democracy.
They had to pay a heavy price in their old age.
The government of that time used to attack them and put them in Turunga.
In 1977, when Janta Party won the elections, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
Accordingly, the Fundamental Rights conferred under clauses 20 and 21 of the Constitution shall not be abrogated even during the Emergency.
Morarji Bhai had amended this incident so that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975, the repetition of such a thing should never happen again in the future.
Today, once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity about the Padma awards.
In such a scenario, we want to honour those who work selflessly for the people at the grassroots level.
Many people are making positive changes in the lives of people by working hard.
Those people who are selflessly attached to public service, social service and nation service above all are karmayogis.
They are true activists and are far away from the world of fame, they dont have to know whether their names have come or not.
He believes in work, Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam, Geete's message is being observed in a way.
I would like to talk to you about some such people today.
Friends, these rare paintings are taking us to new generations.
Abdul Ghafoor's "Tree of Life" was a tribute to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the standards of the Padma awards the Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Mother Goddess .
The way they have dedicated their entire life to the service of mother cows, their work is reflected in a different way.
They are training many people around the world even when they have reached centuries of age.
Till now, he has made 1500 people Yoga teachers, Jamuna Tudu, popularly known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has worked as a brave man with the timber mafia and the oceans to save the forest from desertification in 50 hectares.
Due to the hard work of Jamunabai ji, the villagers in that area are now planting 18 trees after the birth of every child in their homes.
He has worked towards women empowerment and how farming can be beneficial.
Kisan Chachan has inspired 300 women from our region to become financially self-reliant by linking them with Self Help Groups.
It can be said that this change in the list of award winners is a new image of transforming India.
My dear countrymen, I am going to have a heart-wrenching experience recently.
Nowadays, wherever I go, I try to get the opportunity to interact with some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PMJAY or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have been told that this scheme is bringing about a massive change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person cannot afford medicines without money, then we must inform him about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of exams will start in schools.
The 10th and 12th exams to be conducted by different exam boards across the country will start in the next few weeks.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the students, parents and teachers.
A few days ago, in Delhi, a massive programme like Pariksha Pe Charcha was organised, like the Town Hall programme.
Pariksha Pe Charcha (Pe Charcha) programme was specifically interacted on various subjects related to examinations.
This will certainly benefit the students, he added.
All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the entire recording of this programme on YouTube and convey my best wishes to all the examiners for the upcoming exam.
My dear countrymen, there is talk of India and there cannot be talk of festivities.
This is because we have a thousand years old culture and tradition.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and had got the opportunity to spend some time with the disabled brothers and sisters during this visit to Kashi.
And it was a pleasant surprise for me to hear a copy of it.
Youth with disabilities can imitate the way I speak in Mann Ki Baat.
It does not mean that people only listen and abandon Mann Ki Baat.
I was really impressed by the power of that disabled youth.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you through Mann Ki Baat is a unique experience for me.
In a way, I interact with crores of families every month through radio.
Many times, while talking to all of you, reading the letters you have sent or listening to your telephone views, I feel that you all consider me as a member of your family.
This is a pleasant feeling for me.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, all of us are going to be busy in the conduct of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Respecting a strong democratic tradition, Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
This means three months of March, April and full month of May.
With a new belief after the election, with the strength of the blessings of all of you, I will once again start the programme to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveswara has taught us - Kayakve Kailas, which means accomplishing our responsibilities by working hard, that is, the residence of Lord Shiva in Kailashadham.
His reputation was as a scholar who had a wonderful influence in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his entire life to providing food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
I am fortunate to have received the blessings of the revered Swami ji several times.
In 2007, our former President, Dr. Sivakumar Swami ji paid tributes to him on his birth centenary year.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for the venerable Swami ji.
In Giving, Your Received Happiness Alliance Will Blace, All Your Actions Dr. Kalam Sahebs poem presents the life and mission of Siddhaganga Monastery in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great soul.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our Republic. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
People across the globe are surprised to see the scale at which elections are held in India, which is celebrated as the National Voters Day on 25th January, and it is natural for every countryman to take pride in the Election Commission of India in the skills that our Election Commission manages.
Every citizen of India, who is a registered voter in our country.
He is a registered voter and does not leave any stone unturned to ensure that he gets an opportunity to vote.
In Himachal Pradesh, polling stations are being set up at an altitude of 15,000 feet above sea level. While voting is being arranged on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Imagine just one voter.
Whenever I hear this, it is natural to take pride in the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy that the Election Commission employees go to distant places and arrange for voting so that they get the opportunity to use their voting.
I appreciate the Election Commission of India, which has consistently tried to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the younger generation to register if they are eligible to vote.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote.
We must realize this responsibility.
This should be our attitude, our tendency.
This should be our culture.
I urge the noble person of the country to make people aware by running a mission to register votes together or to make people vote.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and your participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done something wonderful and unforgettable for humanity.
Our country is multi-faceted.
One such great personality was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes of India's freedom struggle.
We are aware that several rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army has been built in the Red Fort.
The museum dedicated to Yad-e-Jallian and 1857 ATEN FIFTE consumption, Indias First War of Independents and the entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
Every brick in this museum has a smell of our glorious history.
Staying in the museum inspires us to see the legends of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
At the same venue, British Rajpatin Khatla was run on the brave son of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I visited the Red Fort, the Kranti Mandir, the memories associated with Netaji, the family members of Netaji presented me a very special cap cap.
Netaji used to wear a cap.
I have given you that cap in the museum so that the people coming there can see that cap and take inspiration from it.
In fact, our heroes need to continue to transform their valour and patriotism to new generations.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
At one event, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhas Bose had hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone would be surprised because here is a tradition of 15th August.
On this occasion, 75 years of the formation of Azad Hind Government were completed.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organisation.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Let me tell you, let me know, let me make many brilliant announcements like Azad Dunga that Netaji placed in the heart of every Indian.
There was a demand for presenting files related to Netaji for several years. And I am glad that we could do this thing.
I remember that day when Netaji Saran's family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we discussed a number of issues related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that several places related to India's great heroes have been developed in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar.
If we come to Delhi then definitely see these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you one story related to Netaji's life.
As I always considered radio connectivity as an important medium, Netaji too was extremely busy with radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched Azad Hind Radio and interacted with soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of communicating on radio.
He used to say the first thing in his speech - 'Dhis Is Subhash Chandra Bose Speaking to You Over the Azad Hind Radio' and so on.
I was told that these radio stations were broadcasting weekend news in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashtu and Urdu.
The Radio Station will be run by M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were extremely popular among the common people and their programmes gave a big boost to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been established in this Kranti Mandir.
Attempts have been made to present the most attractive methods of Indian art and culture here.
The Museum has four historical exhibitions and has over 450 centuries old paintings and art works.
The museum will showcase the excellent artworks of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravivarma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Gemini Roy, Saloj Mukherjee.
And I would particularly urge you all to visit Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that art is being discussed here and I am telling you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
Till now we recognize Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and composer.
But I would like to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
They have also drawn the pictures of animals and birds, they have drawn many beautiful pictures of nature. Not only this, they have also drawn many human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that they have not given any name to most of their pictures.
He was confident that his painting visitor would himself understand the meaning of that painting, and would be able to understand the meaning of his message from his vision.
His paintings are also being exhibited in European countries, Russia and the USA.
I hope that we will definitely visit his painting in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message from a little bit.
He used to say - "Jati-Jati-Jati-Jati-Hajo-Ketan ki-Pataraidas i. e.
He used to say that if God really lives in every person, then it is not right to divide it on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that he explained to the world the true meaning of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar ji has written on MyGov that I should highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take keen interest in the space programme and think beyond the sky by considering something different.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, when I got the opportunity to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has made a significant contribution to Indias space programme.
Innumerable young scientists from across the country have contributed to our space programme.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching out to the space.
This is the Kalam-Set Launch by our students on 24th January.
The sounding rockets made by the students of the University in Odisha have established a number of records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since independence till 2014, almost the same number of space missions have been launched in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of launching 104 satellites from one spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technology in an excellent way to protect lives and property.
Be it the cyclone or rail or road safety, all these space technologies are helping us.
Our fishermen brothers have been given naval devices which are also helpful in economic upliftment along with their safety.
We are using space technologies to improve public service delivery and accountability.
Under the Housing for All scheme, nearly 40 lakh houses in about 23 states have been geo-tagged.
Besides, under MNREGA, about 3. 5 crore properties have also been geo-tag.
Our satellites today are a symbol of the growing power of the country.
We are also contributing to excellence in our relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative that has gifted development to our neighbouring countries.
Through our unprecedented competitive launch services, India is today not only a developing country but also a developed nation.
The sky and stars for children are always very attractive .
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to move beyond the limits that they have been able to understand so far.
Our children are not only watching stars but also looking for new stars and motivating them.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those who play will open up and this year many young sportspersons and sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports events at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When a local sportsperson performs his best, he will be the best performer in the world.
The Khelo India Sportspersons from all States have performed well at their own level.
Many sportspersons who have won medals will be a great inspiration.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Helveli Satarai, the captain of the 21-year-old Mahila Kabaddi Association of Maharashtra, went to her childhood and encouraged the skills of her brother and her husband Sonali.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged in sports like Kabaddi.
Despite this, Sonalin chose Kabaddi and performed excellent performances.
Ansol's 10 year old innovative Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal at Kamati Hin weightlifting.
His father is a farmer in Belagao.
When we talk about India's creation then the resolution of youth power is a New India.
This narrative of Khelo India tells us that not only the big cities are contributing to the creation of New India but also the youth, children, young sporting talents from small towns, villages and towns.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious Beauty Contests.
This unique tournament is called a clean and beautiful toilet.
People are making beautiful paintings by keeping their toilets clean, painting them and making them beautiful, we will get to see pictures of clean and beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media too.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and village heads to lead this mission in our panchayats.
Definitely put photographs of your clean and beautiful toilets on social media including Mylzatghar.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we have started a journey to ensure that the country is completely clean and open defecation free.
Today, India is moving towards becoming Open Defecation Free (ODF) much before 2nd October, 2019, so that we can pay our homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
Ankul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exam warriors.
Ankul ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
For many families, the first part of the year is the warmth of the examinations.
Students, their parents and teachers are busy in conducting exam related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would surely like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but you will be happy to know that after two days, on January 29, at 11 am, the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme will be organised by parents and teachers from all over the country.
And many students from abroad will also participate in the event.
I will certainly place some of these ideas and suggestions before you in the town hall programme.
You can also see the same television broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
We should also pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
The year 2018 is about to end.
And that is why the experience benefits, and the confidence of choosing is also generated.
What can we do so that changes can be brought about in our lives and the society and the country can contribute towards it.
My best wishes to you all for 2019.
All of you must have decided to keep a memory of 2018.
It is also important that the year 2018 will be remembered as a country and the strength of our 125 crore people.
And it is a matter of great pride for all of us.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The reputed institutions of the world recognized that India is working to eradicate poverty at a record pace.
Cleanliness is progressing towards achieving 95 per cent of the country's unwavering resolve.
For the first time since independence, a tricolor was hoisted on the 75th day of Azad Hind Government.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the country has got the worlds highest statue, the Statue of Unity.
The country's name has been raised in the world.

The country's defence has become stronger.
This year, our country has successfully completed the nuclear triangle, that is, we are now equipped with nuclear weapons in the three regions of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
The country's daughters travelled the world through the Sagar Parikrama and the country was filled with pride.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
That is why a revolution has started in the waterways sector .
The country's longest rail-road bridge was inaugurated, the first and the 100th Pakyong airport in Sikkim was inaugurated.
India also won the Blind Cricket World Cup under the age of 19.
India earned a large number of medals in the Asian Games this year.
India also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about the hard work of every Indian in our collective endeavours, our Mann Ki Baat will be so powerful that 2019 will be bright.
This has been possible only because of the tireless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we met some extraordinary Indians in December this year.
This was stated by Dr. Jasendran at Chennai on 19th December.
Doctor Jashendran is known as the cheapest treatment to the poor.
People say that he was prepared to serve the patient.
On this website, I have read a lot of articles about the inspirational work of his society.
Sulagitinarsamma, Karnataka died on 25th December.
Earlier this year, he was honored with Padmashri.
There are so many individuals like Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to share the social efforts of the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party's activists told me that some young doctors in the city provide free treatment to the poor patients by organizing camps.
Its heart lung critical care is taken every month in which camps have the facility of free treatment of many types of diseases .
Today every month hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors serving patients with a sense of selflessness is indeed explicit.
Today, I am proud to say that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago more than three lakh people had launched a cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I'm still in Thebetterindia.
I am sure that this will help the maximum number of people to know about the transformation of the society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, several good work is being done around us in the society.
And this is due to the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important factor in every society.
When sports are played, the sportspersons also get a fillip.
We can see many things like the fame, recognition and respect of sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many things that are bigger than the world of sports.
I would like to tell you about Kashmir's daughter Hanaya Nissar, who won a gold medal in the Karate Akalya competition held in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanayana studied and practiced karate with hard work and discipline, learnt the barracks and proved himself.
I pray for her bright future on behalf of all my countrymen.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, 16 year old Rajni had a lot of discussion in the media about this girl child.
Rajani had said that her father had made a lot of sacrifices and had done a lot of hard work to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before Rajni and his emotions were raised.
When Rajani expressed his desire to learn fists, the father collected all possible resources and enhanced his enthusiasm.
Rajni had to use old gloves to practice fat war because the financial condition of her family was stagnant .
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni was not able to stretch and learn fitness.
She has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha ueen for helping Rajni and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20 year old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni Cycle has become the fastest Asian in the world.
It used to cycle around 300 km daily for 159 days.
You can imagine 300 kilometers of cycling everyday.
His determination to cycle is truly explicit.
Whether we get inspiration from such achievements or not
Especially when my young friends hear about the odds, they also get an inspiration to do something by crossing the barriers.
If we are determined, if we have the strength in our resolve then all the problems will be solved automatically.
Any problem can not be obstructed.
When we hear about such an example then we also get inspiration from every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be many festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi and Maghi in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals the color of traditional dances will be seen somewhere in the country and somewhere in the country iron will be burnt with the joy of the fragrance.
After this the day begins to grow slowly and the season of the aroma of winters begins to grow .
Many congratulations to our farmer brothers and sisters who feed us.
The spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in our festivals.
We can see how our festivals are identical with nature.
Societies and natures are not different in Indian culture but individuals and communities are the same.
The best example of our close relations with nature is the calendar based on festivals.
In this, not only are the festivals of the year but also the planets and constellations.
How old is our relationship with the natural and astronomical events with these traditional calendars
According to the moon and sun calendar the date of festivities is fixed at the speed of the moon and the sun .
It depends on the calendar which counts on the calendar .
Festivals are also celebrated in many areas according to the condition of constellations.
Gudhi Rahava, Chetichand and Ugadi are celebrated as lunar calendars while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaisakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated as sun calendars.
River and water conservation have a special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath is the festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds .
Lacs of crores of people take bath in the holy rivers in Makar Sankranti also .
Our festivals also teach us social values.
On the one hand, it has ancient significance and on the other, every festival easily inspires social fraternity.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for 2019 and wish you all the joy in coming festivals.
My dear countrymen, there are so many things in our culture that we can take pride in and the whole world can be proud of.
People from the country and abroad come there and join the Kumbh forever.
In the Kumbh Congregation, the people of faith and devotion are immersed.
In one place, millions and millions of people from India and abroad have gathered here.
The tradition of Kumbh is imbibed and blossomed by our great cultural heritage.
This year, from 15th January, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organised in Prayagraj. Perhaps you all are eagerly waiting for it.
Saint-Mahatme Prayagraj has been reaching for the Kumbh Mela from now on.
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the list of unique cultural traditions of humanity, which can enable us to realise its global significance.
A few days ago, ambassadors of many countries had come to see the Kumbh Mela.
At that time, the national flag of many countries was thrown at once.
The Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj is expected to attract more than 150 countries.
With the divine power of Kumbh, India's magnificence will be unfolding in the entire world.
The Kumbh Congregation is an effective instrument for self-diagnosis and everyone who comes here feels differently.
This is a huge educational experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on with a lot of enthusiasm.
People of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about Kumbh.
This year, emphasis is also being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If you look at cleanliness along with cleanliness in the Kumbh Congregation then your message will reach far.
This year, the devotees will also be able to pay homage to the Akshayvat after the holy bath in the Sangam.
This Akshayvat, which symbolises the faith of the devotees, was closed for several years in a fort.
But now the fort of Akshayvat has been opened to all.
I would urge you people that when you visit Kumbh then you must upload some of the different aspects and colors of the Kumbh Mela on social media.
May this Kumbh of spirituality become the Mahakumbh of philosophy for Indians in India.
May this Kumbh of Artisanship also become Mahakumbh of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity in the minds of all our countrymen about the Republic Day celebrations of 26th January.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable relationship.
From South Africa, it became Mohan, Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firmly in opposition to casteism.
He also established FinICS and Tolstoy Farms, which raised the voice for peace and justice all over the world.
The year 2018 is also celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mandela, which is also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela is considered to be an ideal in the fight against discrimination all over the world.
He had the courage and motivation to rebuild Turungwas for so many years from respected Bapu.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not just inspirations for the entire world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP Conference was organised at Kevadia on Narmada coast in Gujarat, where the worlds tallest statue is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed discussions were held on how steps should be taken to empower the security of the country and its people.
At the same time, I announced the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration which will be awarded to those who have contributed in any way to national integration.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity uninterrupted.
Sardar Patel believed that India's true strength is united in its diversity.
Respecting his feelings and paying homage to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is a sacred occasion to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, for a long time, Northern India was his workplace and he laid down his life at Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi, North India and the last of its life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire Bharat Yojana got his blessings.
If you look at his life then you can see a reflection of the whole of India.
After the martyrdom of the father Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji won the post of Guru in a short span of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice as a legacy from the Guru.
His personality was calm and straightforward but whenever there was an attempt to smile the poor and the weak, whenever there was an injustice to him, Guru Gobind Singh always fought for the poor and the weak.
He used to say that it is not right to demonstrate his strength by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that this is the biggest service to alleviate human sufferings.
He was an excellent archer, as well as a master in many languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again bow down to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are several good things in the country that are not discussed at large.
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is implementing National Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).
The work is underway to promote safe and healthy habits of food.
India can prosper only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, the Prime Minister said that F.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to him on the initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to join this initiative.
I would like to say that we should also participate in it and especially the children should show these things.
The education that gives importance to diet is important from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last edition of 2018 and I will once again meet you in 2019.
Life, life, individual, individual, individual, nation or society, inspiration is the foundation of the progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with this new inspiration, new zeal, new resolutions, new accomplishments and new heights.
On 3rd October, 2014, we all started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat on the holy occasion of Vijayadashmi.
He was the only man who was a snake-bearer.
There was no cloth for dressing on the dhaba.
He had constructed a small tapri-like hut along the road.
There was talk of it on the radio.
It should reach out to the remotest parts of the country, from the villages on the edge of the country to the metro cities, from the farmers to the young professionals.
Recently, AIR has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen from that survey the meaning of some is totally different and millions of people.
Of the people surveyed, nearly 70 per cent of them are people listening to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat is a major contributor to enhancing the positive spirit in the society.
This is a reflection of the positive attitude that our countrymen have in their hearts.
Several people have also learnt that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of Voluntaryism.
People are coming forward with great zeal and enthusiasm for social service.
I am very happy to see that the popularity of the radio is increasing due to Mann Ki Baat.
But radio is no longer the only medium in this journey.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
The doubts that you have raised are absolutely correct.
What would happen if a leader was given the opportunity to speak and millions of crores of people would listen to him
I studied which words were used again and again.
The researchers have concluded that this programme is not related to politics. When I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, I had made sure that there was no government support in it.
I was inspired by you for taking up this solemn pledge.
This is evident in the letters preceding every part of Mann Ki Baat, online comments, and the telephones that are available to the listeners.
What will happen and what will happen but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will remain alive.
Somebody writes to me from a remote location in the country that people should not be involved in dealing with small shopkeepers like us, auto rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers.
Now a campaign like selfie with dotter can be launched in a small village in the state of Haryana and spread all over the country and abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government statement.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of Aspirational India.
If we ask a question in simple terms, if we answer that question then we dont prepare anything.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Every time I get letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
People record their message in their voices by calling them on this number.
It is my endeavour to save the maximum number of letters and commentaries from every part of Mann Ki Baat.
And that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation of the writer becomes a part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, the letters are not just a piece of paper.
In fact, this sound is mine in Mann Ki Baat but all the examples, feelings and inspirations belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people in Mann Ki Baat whom I have not been able to name till date but these people are sending their letters.
Efforts are also made to ensure that all the letters that cannot be accessed in Mann Ki Baat and the concerned departments take note of their suggestions.
It is because of his hard work that Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of All India Radio prepares each part for broadcast in different languages.
Some people simply hear the Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in style.
In a way, it becomes Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank them for their talent and skills.
I urge all of you to listen to this programme in your local language as well.
However, many of the topics discussed in the Mann Ki Baat were also raised by the media.
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drug Free India, Selfie with Daughter, etc. The media created innovative ideas on themes and gave them the form of an expedition and worked very well in that field.
Without our cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our ancestors also stand up like a very big problem in conversation .
I would like to prioritise the people without acceptance and reaction.
Communication Gap between the elderly, the adult and the Kumar Vyogatti children of the family was usually discussed.
In fact, most of the households have a limited scope to discuss with children and children.
In this for a long time discussions were held on the study of children and their habits as well as their present lifestyle .
I have always been trying to learn something different from what they are doing or how they think about it.
Finally, this is the New India.
Some people say that the young generation wants to do a lot of things at once.
I say - what is wrong in this
These youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and to dream big. They have brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineeta ji has written on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow on 26th November, I should talk about the Constitution Day i. e.
They say that this day is very special because it has now been 69 years since we accepted the constitution and we will enter the 70th year.
Just imagine, within three years these great personalities have created such a vast and widespread event.
The way these great people have prepared a decisive solution is a good example of the management and productivity of the waste.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties are described in detail in detail.
The synergy between the lives of the citizens will take the country forward.
If we respect and respect the rights of others, our rights will be protected automatically. Similarly, if we follow our duties laid down in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that in 2010, when the Republic of India had completed 60 years, we had set up a grand pilgrimage in Gujarat by setting an elephant in Gujarat.
Our efforts to create awareness among the youth about the constitution and to inform them about the important aspects of the constitution were memorable.
And ensure that Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace and Prosperity Nandel in our country.
My dear countrymen, we cannot forget the contributions of the great personalities when we talk about the constitution committee.
He was a great man, revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
What is a Republic and what is a Parliamentary system is, this is not something new for India.
He said that this freedom that we have got after such a struggle is precious and we have to protect our blood from the last drops of our blood.
India First Ha Ha Dr.
My dear countrymen, just two days ago, on November 23, all of us celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and next year we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Dev ji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony.
All State Governments and Union Territories have been instructed to celebrate this event in a big way.
In this way, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all the countries around the world.
I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Gurudev at that time.
The Gurudwara was severely damaged during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But the manner in which the state government has worked with the help of local people, it is still an ideal thing.
An important decision has been taken by the Government of India to build the Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur in Pakistan.
But this journey of ours will continue.
The more people will be associated with us, the better will be our journey and everyone will be happy.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what do I get because of Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the son of all of us, and every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the Run for Unity.
I urge all of you to participate in this race for listening in large numbers.
About six months prior to independence, on January 27, 1947, the edition of the worlds famous international magazine Time Magazine, Sardar Patel was published.
It was a map of India that was broken up in many parts.
At that time there were more than 550 institutions in the country.
Even though the British had finished their juice in India, they were trying to break the country into several parts and then leave the country.
Time magazines have written that India is facing threats such as split, violence, cereal degradation, inflation and ruling politics.
Time magazines have further written that if anyone has the ability to bury the country in the thread of listening and healing wounds then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This story of Time magazine opens many other aspects of the life of an iron man .
After the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s, what direction did he provide to the Bardoli Satyagraha
He merged all the institutions into India.
Be it Junagadh or Hyderabad or Travancore or Rajvati of Rajasthan, Sardar Patel's ideological maturity and strategic skills, we can see each other in India today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel after seeing this country bound by unity and our Mother India.
The Statue of Unity will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel on the 31st of October this year.
The statue, built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty statue in the USA.
The statue is the worlds highest statue of skyscrapers.
Every Indian will be proud of the fact that the worlds tallest statue is in India.
Sardar Patel, whose association with the land, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday, all of you have celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the Indian Army descended on the soil of Kashmir and protected the ghost from insurgents.
This historic event is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the great army officer of India, Sam Manikshaw.
In that interaction Field Marshal Manikshaw reminded me of the time he was in Colonel.
31st October is also the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Indira ji paid her respects.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like sports
Spirit, strangth, skill and stamina are very important in the field of sports.
The country's youth who have these qualities will not only be able to progress in the fields of economy, science and technology but also in the field of sports.
I had the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018.
India won 72 medals in the event, creating a new record and honouring India.
I am fortunate to have personally met all these talented Para Athletes and congratulated them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that in Youth Olympics 2018, our youth has done the best ever performance.
In this competition, we won three more medals in the Mix types without 13 medals.
You might remember that Indias performance in the Asian Games this year has been excellent.
See how often I have used the best and most glorious words of this time while talking for a few minutes.
This is the story of Indian sports which is scaling new heights every day.
India is making a record not only in sports but also in fields which were never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won a Gold in Athletics for the country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He is a Divyang from birth.
When he was eight years old, his father was warrior.
Then he took eight years into an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a drive to drive his life, clean the bus of DTC and a waiter in the roadside roads in Delhi.
He is winning the gold medal for India at the same time in the International Games.
Not only this, India has never won any Olympic medal at the senior or junior level in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won history by winning a silver medal in the Youth Olympics.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsperson, lives in a village in Manipur.
While their fathers are labourers, the mother does the job of selling fish.
Many times, there was such a time for his family that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi did not fall.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are numerous such stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stubbornness is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organised the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world appreciated the successful sports event.
A new record of the number of visitors was created in the FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup .
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums across the country and encouraged the youngsters.
This year, India has had the privilege of organizing the Mens Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence in November 2018 and continue till December 16.
Every Indian, be it playing games or be it playing games or be it chess or be it hockey or be it hockey or be it hockey or be it hockey or be it sports or be it sports or be it sports or be it hockey or be it hockey or be it hockey or be it hockey or be it hockey.
India's history in Hockey has been a golden writer.
In the past, India has won gold medals in several events and at one time India has also been the World Cup winner.
India has also given many great players to Hockey.
Whenever there will be talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without these great sportspersons of India.
The whole world knows the magician Major Dhyanchand of Hockey.
Thereafter, he has made a hockey journey from Balwinder Singh Senior, Leslie Glodius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, Team India sportspersons are inspiring new generations of hockey with their hard work and dedication.
There is a good opportunity for sports lovers to see adventurous games .
He should visit Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other teams.
In the meantime along with enjoying the pleasure of the game you can also see several world famous and pious places including the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri and Chilka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Mens Hockey Team and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians stand for their support and support.
I also convey my best wishes to all the teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people who have been volunteering for social work, it is inspiring and encouraging for all the countrymen.
But in a new era, new generations, new hopes, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
A few days ago, I had visited a programme where a portal was launched, the name of the Self for Society, MyGov and the IT and electronics industry of the country have started this portal to encourage their employees for social initiatives.
Every Indian will be proud of the enthusiasm and intimacy he has for this work.
IT is the fragrance of the journey from the society to the society, not me, neither we nor ego.
If someone is educating children, if someone is educating senior citizens, if someone is engaged in cleanliness then someone helps the farmers. And this is not a craving for dedication and a sense of selflessness.
A young person learnt wheelchair basketball to assist the Divyangs wheelchair basketball team.
This is the spirit, dedication, this is a step towards a specific task.
Won't any Indian be proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I was watching people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see an interesting commentary on Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on Mygov: Please tell us that the customs and traditions of many communities of India in Mann Ki Baat are the best examples of coexistence with nature.
We need to learn from them how we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I compliment you for keeping the topic Mann Ki Baat alive.
This is a matter that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture, today the whole world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways of lifestyle balanced.
Though our India is not free from this problem, but to solve this problem, we only want to understand our innovations, our rich history and traditions and especially the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Our tribal culture has been a part of our collaboration with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like goddesses.
The Bhil Adivasi tribes of central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Pimpal and Arjun .
In a desert like Rajasthan, Visnoi society showed us the path of environment protection.
Especially for the conservation of trees, it is acceptable for them to sacrifice their lives, but they do not approve that any tree is damaged.
Mishmi claims her relationship with tigers in Arunachal Pradesh.
They consider them as brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland tigers are seen as the protector of forests .
People from the Warli community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as guests and for them the existence of tigers is a source of prosperity.
The Coal community in Central India believes that their own destiny is linked to the tiger, the tiger does not get food and the villagers will have to starve.
In the reproductive season of Gond tribal fishes in central India fishing stops in some parts of Ketan river .
In southern India, a small hunting community broke down on the Nilgiri foothills, traditionally made of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal communities are very calm and stressed to live together but if anyone harms their natural resources then they do not fear fighting for their rights.
Its not surprising that our first freedom fighters were from the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought strongly against the British government to protect our forest land
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something unique for the society.
This kind of work seems to be rare, but in reality they have a deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh of Punjab.
Gurbachan Singh ji's son was married to an ordinary and hardworking farmer.
Before the marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we will do the marriage of the bride's mother Vadlana in a simple way.
There is no need to spend too much on top and on other things.
We have to celebrate this event in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I am one such thing.
Nowadays, when the issue of marriage is being discussed then it is commonly felt that there will be some big demand in front of the family which will be difficult for the bride's family.
But you will be surprised to know that this is a simple farmer, what he said and what he had laid down before the father of the bride is the true strength of our society.
Promise me that we will never burn straw in our fields.
We can imagine how big social power is there in it.
And we have seen that there are several families in our society who transform the individual event into social interests.
The family of Shriman Gurbachan Singh ji has set a similar example before us.
I have read another village in Punjab in the case of Kallar Majra which is near NABH.
Kallar Majra is discussing that instead of burning the grain stubble, they mix it with the soil and the technology that should be used for it is brought into use.
Congratulations Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to all those who have been doing their best to keep the environment clean.
You have been carrying forward the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle like a true heritage.
Like drops and thumbs, small activity and awareness and positive work play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, in our texts, we have said: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace be on earth, sky, space, fire, gas, gas, gas, garden, subconsciousness, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace. Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace.
Peace be established everywhere in life, in heart, in me, in you, in every part of the world.
Peace: Peace: Peace. Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be seen in the golden letter.
India has a special significance for the 11th of November this year as the first war of war ended 100 years ago on 11th November.
The event is completing 100 years, which will fulfil one hundred years of destruction and humanitarian destruction in those times.
The First War was an important event for India.
In true sense, we did not have to give anything directly to that war.
Yet our soldiers fought valiantly and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there was a war, it was no less than a man.
Our soldiers have shown valour in inaccessible areas and in adverse conditions.
All of this was the only objective - the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world saw the ruins of all destruction.
According to estimates, nearly one crore soldiers and as many citizens lost their lives.
This will help the entire world to realise the importance of peace.
In the last 100 years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean just war.
From terrorism to climate change, economic development to social justice, there is a need for global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of our Northeastern India is different.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people here are extremely talented.
Our Northeast is known for its best practices.
Northeast is such an area which has made a lot of progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the 2018 Future Policy Gold Award for promoting sustainable food systems.
The awards are given to Food and Agriculture Organisations (FAOs) attached to the United Nations.
You will be glad to know that this award for the best policy making is at par with the Oscars in that field.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for placing the award behind the 51 nominee policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October ends.
There is a huge change in the climate.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for these festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself during these festivals, take care of your health and also keep an eye on the social interests.
This festival is an opportunity to take a new decision.
We should move ahead in mission mode with this determination and we should have an opportunity in our lives to make a firm resolve.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more you progress, the more the country will progress.
