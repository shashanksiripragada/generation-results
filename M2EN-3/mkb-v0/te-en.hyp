In our India there is an immense opportunity for festivals in national festivals .
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in promoting festival tourism in India.

Because of the magnificence of these books the future of our society is the future of our society .
My beloved countrymen, on 12 November 2019, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji across the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India , but throughout the world .
Our brothers and sisters of Sikkim reside in many countries of the world who are completely integral to the Guru Nanak Devji museum .
I can never forget the journey that I have done for the gurdwaras of Vancouver , Tehran .
I can tell you so much about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but it has to face many epidemics of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the place of service .
It is believed that the service done by Guru Nanak Devji is invaluable .
They were opposite to the social illusions like unconsciousness .
Sri Guru Nanak Devji inspired his message from afar off countries of the world .
They were one of those traveling more in their time .
They went to many places , where they had spent their hearts with simpleness , listening , simpleness .
Taking the message of Sadbhavan , similar messages they went to all the sides of the north - east , in every place they met with people , saints , saints .
It is believed that the renowned saint of Assam, Shri Shankar Dev had also been touched by him.
They had traveled the sacred Haridwar .
Guru Bagh is a sacred place in Kashi .
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya of Buddhism.

During a Udasi period, Guru Nanak Dev visited the neighbouring areas of Kashmir.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , there are also worshippers .
In Udasi, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They were measured in the minds of lakhs of people who followed their preachings with complete devotion , today they are following their precepts .

There Amritsar Sir Golden Temple was visited , Guru Nanak Devri is present in the year 550 .
Where all these residents have not only seen the Golden Temple , but also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
Guru Nanak Devri is my desire to give more support to bring their thoughts , ideal ideal ideals into our life .
Once again I bow my head to Guru Nanak Devji .
It is my belief that my beloved brotherhoodari Manula , October 31 you will definitely remember everyone .
If we read about the Sirdar Saheb style , then how strong is their planning .
Thousands of delegates from across the country will be required to participate in the Kangras Seminar in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the responsibilities of Samadhishwar were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used the occasion to improve the water supply network in the city.
Who has been built without deficiency of water .
Not only this , in the meeting place apart from the stealing of every representative object , shoes , shoes you will be surprised .
They contacted with rails , Khadi bags were made .
At the same time Khadi Victoria also shined .
Our country has always been deprived of Sardar Patel for playing the role of Ulkhani in the Rajya Sabha.
On the basis of Kullu , traditional opinions they did the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
We all know that a great Bhagirathi , historical program was organised by including the first Homkh Mantra of India , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute .
You will know that Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 the point of view of our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news to Sardar Patel, he took tough decisions without delay.
Aariyar's brothers, Arcot Ramswamy and Arcot Lakshmanaswamy told Lakshmanaswamy, "Traveen corpses have been integrated with the people and the Trivandrum medal has emerged in Lakshadweep first.
Immediately afterwards, the Trivandrum medal was flying there, and all the conspiracy of the neighbours who attacked Lakshadweep were destroyed.
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I am confident that these beautiful islands , sea shores will present you all .
My beloved countrymen, Statue of Unity, made in the memory of Sardar Patel on 31st October 2018, has been dedicated to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
About eight and a half thousand people visited the Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared his heart belief , devotion , besides this there many attractive centres like Cocktas Garden , Butterfly Garden , Jangil Safari , Children Nutrition Park , Ekta Nursery are being developed respectively .
Everyday there will be new employment opportunities for the people and many villages will be able to provide a facility to their homes.

My beloved country , Sardar Patel is sitting in the Iueen of the country .
Ikyat mantra is like our lifestyle culture and we should be strengthening the ICT mantra at every level, every corner, every corner and every corner of the country with ideas like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been steadfast and alert to tackle the unity of the country's mutual goodwill.
If we look around, we find many such examples which are seen continuously working to increase each other's emotions.
Try to forget those situations in their own ways according to their own benefit .
How many types of things are spoken to increase excitement in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some scholars , great people who are not only famous for themselves but they do not know what they are talking to them .
What responsibility is our responsibilities .
But all this is happening for five days , seven days , but on coming to judgment a surprising change has been seen .
On one side it has been done to increase the excitement of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjambhumi the government , royal family , social organizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations of all traditions , civilizations , civilizations have been done by exhibitions .
Try to reduce excitement in the environment .
But those days I remember very well .
The dignity of the destination has been honorably reassured and there is no possibility of increasing the heat and heat anywhere.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us strength .
Those days those symptoms do our support .
It is an example of how much energy gives the country to the country .
On the day of a big injury to the country .
I also dedicate my tribute to them today.
My beloved countrymen , today the story of the house is listening to one afar off , if the story of every village is listening to the story of every village , from north to south , from east to west , from east to west Hindustan is a story of cleanliness .
Every person wants to tell his happy experiences related to every family , every village , every village , because the attempts of cleanliness are hundred thirty crores of Hindustan .
Their fruits are also an hundred crore Hindus .
There is an experience of enjoying adventurous adventure .
Not only to separate the garbage in it , but making that arrangement is also a very important work .
In it , removing garbage on 130 tonnes nearby glacier , which is a delicate life system there , how big service .
That is also a rare species of snow leopards , where there are rare animals like Siachin species of sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachin rivers are the roots of clean water , glaciers .
Therefore the work of hygiene i . . people used rivers like Nubra , Shyok along with giving clean water to the lower areas from here .
My beloved countrymen, festivals are a new festival of awakening in our lives.
Otherwise Deepavali meaning buying something specially is happening more in the family of the family .
I told once that we should try to buy local objects .
If we get necessary things in our village then we do not have to go to Taluka for them .
I tell you many admirations of this festival of Deepavali once again .
We are of various kinds of tongues to Deepavali .
But sometimes coals of fire from carelessness .
My many adventurous feelings .
Blessed are many .

All 125 crore Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv and recalled the surgical strike in 2016.
In the three stages of Terracotta war on our country , when their unconscious ways were discovered in the form of surgical stroke .
How much capacity is hidden in us , how our soldiers cut their lives by cutting their lives , protecting all the country , Manal .
Main days like Parakram Parv remind us of traditional traditions like that of our soldiers in our country .
These days encourage us to maintain the harmony, ethics and ethics of our country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, which is the land of the brave soldiers.
In the two world wars happening in the twentieth century the soldiers of our country gave pure sacrifices for more than one lakh peace .
With the purpose of paying attention to peace it is an adventurous adventurous adventurous .
India is also one of the countries sending soldiers in large numbers to various Shanti Bhadrata teams of the United States.
Our soldiers play an artificial role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
O my beloved country , the sky is unique .
On the 8th honeymoon of October we celebrate the day of air conditioning .
In 1932 the very small air conditioned team of six stairs , 19 soldiers etc . had increased , this is one of the brave , strong airplanes of our team in the twenty first century .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies were also our air conditioned .
Nobody knows about the independence of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
In 1999, the Air Force had also played an important role in eliminating Kargil from transportation.
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills night and night a bomb made them soil .
The archaeological support , scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientif

As a result of energy the woman has also become modern now .
My beloved country , for some days Christian Abhilash Tomy of our boating team has fighted with death for his life .
How to save him from the youth country .
You know that Abhilash Tomy is a very adventurous ruler .
Without using any kind of modern technique , only with the help of a small boat the Indian is the first Indian .
For participating in the Golden Globe Race in the South Hindu ocean he is moving ahead in the sea for eighty days but the terrible sea storm brought him problems .
But this guide of India boating team had spent many days in the sea .
He was a great example of adventure, valour and might, and a few days ago, he was brought to the sea to save him.
My beloved Deshprajala , how important is the second day of October to our country
This year October is a speciality of both .
From now onwards, we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi through several programmes across the world.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhi had started writing some thoughts in the form of a positive program .
Then when independence in 1945 he prepared his thoughts everywhere .
Puja Bapu Railways , villages , traders have given their thoughts before the people of the country on many things like cleanliness , education , education .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is the special identity of his personality .
Bapu had understood everyone how important , special need of the country .
Then it seems as if thy suspicion is melting , thou feels like melting . ' Bapu said .
This mantra which Gandhi had said to my beloved country , Gandhiji is still important .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we went to buy something then remember the worshipped Bapu , we remember this mantra once .
Because of shopping of this thing I am giving benefit to any powder in the country .
Who has enjoyed happiness in the Mughals .
This is his message . I believe that in the life of a person who is poorer than all , weaker and weaker you can bring a great change in your footsteps .
Gandhiji said that with my favorite country , cleanliness one gets freedom .
Because he does not know but India has come to freedom .
For example , due to the production of Khadi , fishing production in every studies many people have given help to the workers .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult that they are not made , they should use each other .
Lal Bahadur Scientists were very humble from outside , from inside the mountain like a mountain .
"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" is an excellent display of scientific personality.
And he gave mantras to the soldiers of his country , to the soldiers of his country , to the soldiers of his country .
It is common to talk about cleanliness while remembering the worshipped Bapu of my beloved country .
September fifteen and fifteen had started a mission called 'Service to Cleanliness'.
Crores of people participated in this garden and I also got the opportunity to do cleanliness work with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself laid the foundation of that school .
People of all classes of the country participate in the tribute of this September fifteenth century .
Let's hear a phone call. "Namaskar
I tell you special thanks for calling your phone .
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) i. e.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will commence with the launch of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on 2nd October, 2018.
If you want to give peace , peace , peace , judgment to people , which is specially important .
In the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedakar many places have been done for the primary hiccups of names .
Inspired by them, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on October 12, 1993.
NHRC's going to finish footprints in a few days.
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also worked to increase human dignity.
Our Prime Minister, our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has clearly stated: Human rights are not for us.
In the symbol of our national human civilization the ideal instrument of Vedic period is engraved in the symbol of ' Sarve Bhagwan ' .
NHRC provides an extensive opportunity for human beings and at the same time, it has also played an important role in stopping the use of hiccups.
In this journey of feet NHRC has made an ideal , a belief environment in the people of the country .
I believe that this is a big event for a healthy society, for the best democracy.
In the national level of Italy along with the work of human crafts the commission of human crafts of twenty six countries has also been established .
An attempt has to be made to understand human rights in the form of a society and this is the basis of the concept of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas - development for all - development for all.
In the month of October , in the month of October , Jai Narayan Jayanti is the birthplace of my favorite country . In this month the festivals of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia Ji begin .
In this regard, I describe in the coming Mann Ki Baat, but this time I must make this proposal. In the last few years, on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, 'Run Fort University' is being organised in every small and big cities of India, 'Run Fort University'.
This time also we made this ' Run Fort University ' in every small and big cities , areas , villages .
The program "Run for Unity" is the best way to remind Sardar Saheb.
Through the ' Run Fort University ' on 31 October we made all the attempts to kiss everywhere in the society , to kiss all the places of the country .
This is the same devotion that we give him .
My beloved country , Navratri , Durga Puja or Vijayadashmi , any name of this sacred festival of my beloved country tells you many wishes in the heart of all of you .
Thank you.

Along with this science , education , students have impressed you the feeling of dedication .
My beloved countrymen , this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers for working hard .
The dry trees , plants , dry rivers of dry sunshine .
But sometimes this rainy season brings very attractive , destruction .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are natural .
The destructions going behind them are unfortunate .
But on occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
The conservation of the conservation programs happening in Kerala is known for all of us .
They did n't leave anything in protecting those stuck in the floor .
Air Force is not a navigable , Army , but BSF , CISF , RAF , everybody has played an important role in the attempts to protect and protect everyone .
I would like to specifically mention the hard work done by the NDRF, how excellent they have helped in such difficult times.
The efforts made by NDRF to tackle the ability of these people, their commitment, effective decision making are a matter of concern for every Indian.
Onam festival .
To come out of this danger very soon we pray to give the power of this festival of Kerala , especially the state of Kerala , the archaeological development of the state of Kerala .
I believe that once the people of Kerala have been with them all over the country , other places that have been sown by the people of the country , once again I believe that all the people of the country are of the whole country .
My beloved country , this time I see the information about the information that came for Manki Bath , then I am about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpai .
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Soni Pat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapn Berji from West Bengal, Akhilash Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, etc.
On the sixteenth honeymoon of August the world , the world drowned in the Shokadra of the country .
And he was a great nation , which left the fourteen years old , and left the eleventh .
If you want to say one way then he went away from the royal palaces of the past teeth .
People have made him the best parlor member , delicate acquaintance , great acquaintance , beloved leader .
Because of bringing in the reproductive organs of superstition the country of Altitude remains illuminated .
We are always grateful to Atal Ji because of the 91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003.
This environment has brought two major changes in the royal palaces of India .
The first change is that the number of mantras in the states is fifteen percent per capita in the number of seats .
Atal Garhwal changed it .
That is why the forests of money were Adada .
Therefore the program has increased .
As far as the Atal Ji is concerned, these conditions have started to grow in the healthy traditions of our political culture.
Atal Garhwal is a true country .
Change has been done during entering the budget in their administration .
Initially according to the tradition of Englishmen during the time of parlor in London hence in the evening he used to enter the market .
In 2001 Atalji changed the time of evening to eleven in the morning .
In the same way you are seeing how many churches of states , central states once in the country .
It is a good consequence for delivery .
Healthy democracy , excellent democracy , good traditions , constant labor to strengthen democracy , negative churches , etc . also give us excellent devotion .
The job of working in Lok Sabha is eighteen percent , the working of the state is seventy and four percent .
The Monsoon Session of Parliament is a reminder of social justice and the evolution of youth.
In these museums many important girls used for youth , backward classes have been emotionalized .
There is also a desire to make a commission like the SCT commission of decades .
In order to ensure the powers of the backward classes, the country has accomplished its commitment to appoint an OMC this time.
It has also given a kingdom a goal of social justice which takes forward .
That is why the parlor of parlor has entered the difficult training by entering the parlor of the parlor .
According to this besides the deficiency of the mosquitoes that do Dussehra the girls in the twelve eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven girls are executed .
Just a few days ago, you had read in the newspapers. In Mandashore, Madhya Pradesh, a place of law was initiated for only two months after the investigation of the girl and the execution of two convicts in the case of rape.
Earlier, in a court in Kathani in Madhya Pradesh, the culprits were hanged after only five days of inquiries.
In Rajasthan also some such fast decisions have been taken .
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness occurring on women , girls .
When we move ahead for the country then we can bring changes in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived.
In the meeting of rains this time everybody has a ideal ideal ideal .
All the parlors of the country are telling thanks to the heart of all the parlors of the country .
My favorite country , today the view of Kotla people of Kotla is on Asia Churches going on in Jakarta .
Asia creams are even more .
I am telling all the sports ready for the country .
India will build a bright future only when it is fit.
I would like to see the best exhibition of the magnificence of the magnificent exhibitions of Asia .
Everyone is the contemporary conservation of the national year .
Besides this the whole country also reminds him with great pride , self-confidence .
In his memory September is celebrated as the fifteenth day of engineers .
The engineers of our country walking in their steps have published their own identity in the world .
It is called ' ruin ' in Kutch .
These houses have been seen three earthquake .
But at some places you will find any harm .
Our ancestors of this house have been built according to the environment here .
It is said pride that after listening to it I felt that the engineers of that time before centuries , according to the local conditions , ordinary people living safely have done such constructions .
Now when we are celebrating engineers Day then we should also think about our future .
Keep work shops at every place .
During changing we learn any new things .
What should be taught for students
Let's meet again.
In this center at many places rains were coming properly .
At some places more rains are also coming .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
Humans have brought opposite to nature .
That is why sometimes nature falls on us .
Therefore the responsibility of protecting nature is our responsibility .
Twelve Junior Football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour .
Normally going into that cave, it takes a few hours to get out.
But the decision of that day is another way .
There was no way to come out , they were near a small Dibba located inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but in one way eighteen days were left like that .
On one side if they fight with obstacles , on the other hand the human species of the world has exhibited the precious elements of God .
People worldwide prayed to be safe outside these children safely .
Those children who do not get stuck , in what condition they try to know everything .
How to take water out if it is not possible to save them during the time of rainy season it is impossible to take them out .
With the point of view of luck they enjoyed everybody , enjoyed the world as soon as they were safe .
But how did this protection program happen all the same thing I remembered from the other point of view .
The complete responsibility found in every level is marvellous .
Government , parents , their family members , media , people of the country , everybody has also been seen marvellously , courageous .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of Dhaiya Land Navika had also lost his life .
It is enough to work by keeping our mind on our goal with peace , stable mind .
After some days the favorite poet of our country had left us .
Our Indians can also inspire how much strength can be given to the Nirj river every time.
This is the time of the start of art galleries .
As soon as July comes, the youth asks for the most important part of their life, where their vision shifts from questions to cut-offs.
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital .
The students come into the shadow of professor from the shadow of parents .
It is believed that my young friends keep on shining their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you have to change yourself , separating from the house for the first time , getting out of the city , separating from a safe environment .
How many youths come out to give their house for the first time , to give a new direction to their life .
You all have to say that stay calm , spend life , enjoy your conscience in life completely .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , mixing friends , keeping that friend standing is such a task that it has to be done with a lot of knowledge .
New experts , new languages learn new languages .
The student of Assam Chaudari of a unparalleled family of Madhya Pradesh has made victory over all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur AIMS Talu had successfully in the first attempt of MBBS test .
And his father did the work of gathering garbage , and nurtured his family .
My beloved country , for some days Christian my eyes attracted a newspaper associated with the dreams of two youths .
Reading inside it is known that these are trying to bring changes in the life of normal person by using youth technology , creatively .
I am discussing with the Indian youth once in the city of Sanjoj, called the Technology Hab in America.
I want them to do something for the country after thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
Both of them using their professional experts make a memorial pocket .
Apart from mixing the people of these villages in the world they need to give some advice , information about Gony , then it was available in their own mobile only .
In a way an attempt is made to bring digital option in this Yap village . the development works done in the village has become easy to record , tracking , tracking .
The YAP will include the Phone Directory of the village, the Department of Communications, the Government of India, the Health and Wellness Centre.
In a way, to know the FACT rate between the village feature farms of this Yap, the marketplace of their produce will be useful.
If you consider this thing in a definite way then one thing is understood that those youngsters are living their lives in America, in America, in the midst of their thoughts and ideas.
Because of this reason they can do anything properly in the village .
This relation with your village , its roots , this relation with its roots , is natural in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , distant situations , conditions , a thin dust gets named on it but if someone touches it with a small salt then all the internal things come up again .
Pandarpur is a sacred village of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
One fifteen , twenty days before Ashadh Ekadashi i . . pilgrimages , pilgrims along with palanquins go to Pandarpur pilgrimage on foot .

There is an interesting incident related to a Tilak statue located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad.
He said that when Lokmanya Tilakji died on 11th August, 1920, he would lay the foundation stone of his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ahmedabad city was selected as the memorial of the Lokman Tilk Garden for the memorial of the world . This garden is named as Britain .
Finally the idol is built that idol of Sardar Garhwal was built by Mahatma Gandhi Ji in 1929 besides anyone .
The most important thing is that in that incident the worshipped Bapu in his address was that after coming to Sardar Patel a person of Ahmedabad city was found not only because of his devotion but also because of his devotion the construction of the idol of Tilak Ji was possible .
Due to the attempts of Lokman Tilak the tradition of community Ganesh festivals started .
These Community Ganesh Festivals are an effective medium for traditional devotion, festivals, social goodwill, compassion, equality among the people.
Our old heritage , history standing in the history of these dynasties also know how much interest in our youth .
Today in many cities we keep seeing worshipping the idols of Ganesha in every street .
Pujas are organized by mixing a team in that street .
This is a unique opportunity of our youth where it is possible to learn the qualities of nervous system , carelessness etc .
Good milk , development fruits give every Indian .

But in reality not only estimated that incident , but it is also an attempt to injure our confidence .

The youths , educations were standing in the attempt of this Bhagirathi for change in society for two hours from their daily routine .
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have worked as an inspiration for all the residents of the country.
With their incidents they changed their place apart from their own attempts .
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, only bugyal wheat, gardens, corn, barley etc. are grown.
Because of being a hilly area the palanquin of these fruits is not available .
It has been found that the rails of the Capkot region have discovered the way to increase the price of selling in these fruits directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits this iron substance is very beneficial for the pregnant women .
All these rails were organised in Munar village , where the factory of making these biscuits opened .
Looking at the bravery of the farmers, the government has also contributed to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Nowadays besides approximately fifty anganwari centres of Bageshwar district apart from Almora , Kausani are provided .

We are aware of various kinds of disembarked places of tourist destinations but we should not forget that our ancestors have forgotten about the conservation of water conservation.

Therefore because of not being treated at the time of treatment he made a hospital with the point of view of death of other poor people .
For his goal the soldiers of Saddle 's house adopted all the girls , donors .

When we talk about science then first India Sir C . .
His research is famous by the name of Raman effect .
On one side there is a tradition of the main Ganesha scientist Bodhya , Bhaskar , Brahmagupta , Aryabhat etc .

In the meantime, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai - Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence - which is a grand invitation for the start of the year.
It is very interesting to know about the wonders happening in science .
Through the medium of artificial intelligence one gets help in making instruments for robots , bots and many other special tasks .
In between these instruments also increase their own intellegence even more .
This technology is useful for glittering the lives of many lice , baadhis , necessity .
Is it possible to get any help from the Artificial Intelligence to make the life of Divyang brothers and sisters comfortable in this programme
For a few days, I got the opportunity to go to Ahmedabad with the Prime Minister of Israel for the launch of 'I Create' in Patna, Gujarat.
I saw a designer made there .
I believe that in many ways Artificial Intelligence can be used.
The elements of science and technology are stable .
They do not have any price on their own .
Every instrument we want to work only .
But by instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here the goal of human goal is special .
The science should not only be used for human conservation but also for climbing the excellent peaks of human life .
Thamas Alva Adison had failed many times in his researches .
Fortunately, I am in the Auroville of Maharshi Auroville.

They have also seen the way to humanity .
To know the truth it is a special thing to keep question every time .
I am talking about the contribution of National Science Day to all our scientists, scientists and scientists.
Friends, during the calamity, security , disorder etc many times I keep coming to me somewhere .
In a message to Rabindra Singh ji from Pune, Shri Narendra Modi was delivered on the occasion of occupational safety.
Safety standards are not very important in our country where factories and construction work is being done.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at the National Safety Day Celebrations in New Delhi.
In daily life we are not unable to take precautions , it becomes difficult to take precautions during obstacles .
Decrease in concentration - there is danger - one error destructs - enjoyment and tears laughter - so quickly putting the bonds - do not play with devotion - do not lose life, do not read like this .
On crossing that way all the time in our life can not be used .
But if natural opposites are left , more dangers occur due to our layer .
We will not only save our lives but will also save our society from big dangers.
There are many suggestions about the Bhadrata at the place of working once but nobody participates properly .
I would like to make a mock drill in front of the children in various schools once in a week with fire dynasty situated in metropolitan cities .
This country has faced many natural , human made dangers , many chemical , industrial accidents .
These are being run by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in the country.
NDMA reaches there only when there are different kinds of dangers like earthquakes, floods, storms, etc. when there is a crucial operation.
Besides, they also undertake training programmes for capacity building.
In the districts coming to floods , temporary storms a program has been done by the name of Apada friend for training .
Training , best role is how important role .
Two-three-thirds prior to Lu - that is , due to hot eggs every single person died .
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to heat as if the number of deaths occurring due to heat is about 220 .
That is why we are giving importance to Bhadrata, we can be safe.
In such a situation where there is obstruction in the society , I am expressing innumerable people , social churches , social churches .
Under the leadership of India, BIMSTEC, all the countries including Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc. have done a joint distinction exercise.
This is the first , great human use .
They should be a part of our life .
Normally we keep on traveling in airplanes many times and in the beginning we are giving information about air hostess Bhadrata .
All these informations are also heard many times .
But if someone has taken us in the airways , where is life jacket , how should we use it , then I can surely say that no one of us is alright peace .
There is a chance of seeing them clearly .
That's it.
But we pay attention .
Therefore, while sitting in the air, our ears are listened to cautiously, but one of us is saying that they are telling us what we want.
Every kind of life we consider it as if we want .
We should not consider this Bhadrata for us .
If we all are best for our future then the society is also international in it .
My beloved countrymen, this time in the budget, we started a programme keeping in mind the importance of waste to health, waste to energy for villages under the Swachh Bharat Mission.
GOBAR-Dhan means Galvaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The goal of producing wealth and energy through cleaning of villages, animal lice and other sensitive vains is not only to convert them into COMPOST , BIO-GAS but also to produce energy through them .
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crores of their name is thirty lakh tonnes .
Some European countries , Chinese cattle animals , remaining sandalwood are used to produce energy .
But in India it is not used in complete condition .
The part of Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen is now moving forward in this direction.
A goal has been set for generation of bio-gas based energy from vain access to animal lice, organic vains etc.
Under the Gobardhan Yojana, rural brethren in India need to be encouraged to see poor and waste products not only effective but also as a means of earning wealth.
The health of animals becomes shining and their productivity increases .
Because of bio gastric , lighting cosmetic cosmetic energy increases immensely in the matter of energy .
This technique is helpful in increasing the administration of roses , animals and animals .
New gardens increase for vegetation , transplant , physiotherapy , etc .
A nutritious trekking platform has also been prepared to enjoy Gobar Dhan Point which is accomplished by rails, shopping .
I call upon the businessmen, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural areas to come forward and I would like to utilize this opportunity to organise support groups and cooperatives.
I invite you to participate in the Clean Energy and Green Jobs and ask you to make a blessing in the villages of Tadwara.
My dear countrymen, till now we have come to hear about many kinds of festivals like music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.

Every seventh March is celebrated on the eighth day of the international women .
There are many programs in our country , worldwide .

In this context, I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda - that is, the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - 100 years ago, Swami Vivekananda ji's teachings reflect the spirit of mine in Indian culture.
In the tradition made by the recognition of men we participate in the tradition of women . Yashodananda , Kausalya Nanda , the sons of Gandhari , this was the identity of every son .
Now I got some information from Jharkhand .
Under the cleanliness drive, about fifteen lakh women in Jharkhand - this is not a small number but fifteen lakh women were involved in a month's cleanliness campaign.

On the day of these days all women in India are increasing the pride of the country by developing in every hole .
From ancient times the pride of women in our country , the place they got in the society , their support is surprising the world .
There is a tradition of many poisons in India .
There is an adventurous Indian experts in the Vedasar Museum .
Woe to memorials like Lopadra , Gargi , Matrayi .
These are sayings like 'protecting children , reading girls ' but long ago what is said in our scientific sciences , in our scientific sciences , what does one say that if one gets the fruits of 'dasha son , Samma Kanya , Dasha son , then the mortality available is like ' Kanyakeya ' , which means a daughter is like ten sons .
The resurrection occurring due to ten sons is found only with one daughter .
This shows the importance of women in our society .
Lopalamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi, the distinguished personalities of different times
Ahilyabai Holkar administration was done . Rani Lakshmibai was very important , women were always giving inspiration to us , protecting the glorious gloriousness of the country .

Three adventurous adventurous games like Bhavna Kanth , Mohan Singh , Avani Chaturvedi are taking training of 30 warriors .
Al-Wimen Cruise led by Kshamata Vajpayee flew Air India Boating Jet Aircraft from Delhi to Senfrancisco, USA.
He told right - Italy is playing leadership besides the queen of women in every hole .
Even in every hole of these women are showing something or the other .
Some days Christian President had started a new work .
In order to know about this woman's power throughout the country, to get inspiration from her life and work, a book has also been prepared on these women officers, first ladies.
It is available in the form of e-book in the Narendra Modi website.
These are the main role of the country in social changes happening in the society of the country .
These are talking about the women 's civilization , therefore I want to tell about a railway station .
You can imagine what is the relation of a railway station with the women 's empowerment cool .

In all the parts there women were administered .
Point Person Academy, Point Person Academy, Railway Police, Ticket Checking, Anonymous Subbdivision, Point Person Academy, More than forty Ladies and Gentlemen.

This adventurous view has also surprised all the guests coming from abroad and abroad .
This is a form of self confidence , self confidence of self confidence .
These are our women playing the nervous system .
Specialists are changing .
One more thing that came in my sight is that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen an important example of this thing.
The women of Adivasi i . . a definite picture is seen in the minds of everyone , in which a picture of women carrying the weight of the bundles of the bundles built on the heads of the head is seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country .
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh has created a horrific environment with violence, tyranny, bombs, guns and maoists.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this rickshaw .
At the time of maximum women were included in it .
Therefore three benefits are being taken .
Leave that there is no in our hands , adopt changes in important places .
It is a speciality of our society .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .
In some days Christian Bihar has taken an interesting new wave program .
The biggest human tour of the world Human Chain is more than thirteen thousand kilometres to roam the bad customs of the state with fingers .
Through this program the opposite opposite to the marriages of children , Verkata Duracharya has been done .
The opposite to the bad methods like child marriage , Varkata Duracha etc . has given the contribution of fighting the entire state .
Children , elders , enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
This human hall etc . from the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna has become incomparable to the borders of the state .
If all the people of the society have proper developmental results then the society should get rid of the evils like this.

A New India has built a strong, capable India.
I am giving special effort to the people of Bihar state , the main minister of the state , where the administration of the administration of the administration of the administration of the administration of the administration of the people of Bihar state .

It is known about the reproductive medicine before them .
After knowing about the reproductive centres , the expense of medicines started there , the expense of 75 percent decreased .
Medicines available in reproductive centres are available in the market in comparison to fifty percent of the branded medicines available in the market .
That is why common people , especially medicines get so much economic help for old ages .
Due to this reason good quality medicines are available in less quantity .
Three thousand population centres have been established in the whole country .
Therefore besides getting the medicines cheap there is also a chance of trade for those who do their own business .
Affordable medicines are being practiced by the Prime Minister of India at the Amritsar Stores Centre in the hospitals.
The objective of the scheme is to provide healthy, prosperous and healthy India to every poor person in the country.

Mann Ki Baat December, 2017

In some hours the year changes but our words keep on getting traditional .
We remember the great teachings of Jesus Christ all the time .
Jesus Christ told us about the most service of service .
We will also see the essence of service delivery in Bible.
Dear My countrymen , this year the fifteenth Guru Govind Singh Ji had celebrated the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji .
Guru Gobind Singh ji's life full of sacrifice and adventure is a good example of giving strength to all of us.

One Guru , Darshan , Mahayodhya Guru Govind Singh Garhwal standing in all these utensils so much support to the people living in these utensils .
He fighteth against the unrighteous , against the unrighteous .
He taught the way to bring bandhas of Kullu , Dharamshala .
In these attempts he had to break the personality .
But he never let the feeling of hate to reach .
This year, in January, I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind ji in Patna Sahib.
Those who are born in 2000 years or after the birth of 21th century i . . 2018 , January the meaning of Vote of Vote comes .

In this Manasu, I would like to speak to our prestigious youngsters, who have been filled with energy and resolve for 25 years.
I consider them all "New India Youth" meaning "New India Youth" meaning hope, enthusiasm, energy.
I believe that with this powerful youthful skill and strength our dream of a New India will be fulfilled.
New India should be free from violence, social evils, radicalization, extremism, liberty, etc.
In New India, everyone should have equal opportunities and aspirations.
We need peace , unity , emotionality .
My new India came ahead of the youth of India and how my desire was to make new India .
They decide the way for them , all those who are drowned by their way move ahead with their goal .
Walk , also lead the country ahead .

In the meanwhile, I learnt the inspirational story of Shri Anjum Bashir Khan Khattuku, who stood at the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He stood out of his acute pain , hate chains , stood topper in the Kashmir Administrative Cervice test .
In 1990 the rapids burned the house of their ancestors .
Acute pain , hyssop is so much that their family had to leave the land of their ancestors .
All around such hyssical environment is enough to fill dark , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Anjum did not let it happen .
He never left hope.
He had chosen a new way for himself .
He came out of the negative environment and came to himself his victory story .
These days, he served as an inspirational example not only in the Jammu and Kashmir region but also in the youth of the country.
Even if the situations are not so good then by suitable works Nirodh clouds can be discovered .
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet some female children of Jammu Kashmir.
When I am listening to their crafts, enthusiasm and dreams, when they are listening to the progress in their lives, they came to know how much hope they were.
While talking to them I did not see anywhere in them .
There is enthusiasm in them , there is energy , dreams , cultural heritage .
This is my youth . This is the future of my country .
If there is a proposal about the famous religious areas of the world not only in our country but also in the famous religious areas of the world then it is natural to propose about the temple of Shebarimala of Kerala .
Every year many devotees come here in numbers of crores for the blessings of Appa Swami in this world famous temple .
How important is the devotee coming to the place of the devotion , cleanliness was participated with how much challenge .
Especially because of being a place situated between mountainous areas , forests it is even more difficult to hygiene .
But this problem cannot be solved , the problem cannot be converted into a culture , how can we find out the way to escape the problem , so how important is the temple of Shebarimala to know how important it is to help people .
Shri P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a program named Pungvanam .
Every tourist works to clean the garbage for some time in the worship of Lord .
Every morning the view of cleaning the premises of the tourists here is so unique .
How important , how big authority is , how rich is everybody , everybody goes forward after participating in the program of cleanliness .
Many such examples are for our country .
The Swachhta Abhiyan, which is so developed in Shebarimala, will be a part of every traveler's visit to Punganam.
There along with hard rules , cleanliness also runs with them .
Our dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the occasion of the Puja Bapu Jayanti, we reiterate our commitment to transform our country into a Swachh Bharat incomplete Bapus dream of a Swachh Bharat and an India that does not touch us.
Bapuji 's 150th Jayanti we try to give him something or the other in an attempt to give him the clean India of his dream .
Several attempts are being made to participate in the country .
Change occurring due to expansive projects in rural areas , cities are seen .
Clean Survey 2018 will run the worlds largest survey from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the level of sanitation in urban areas.
These surveys take place in about 40 crores of population in four thousand cities .
In this survey, peoples participation in this exercise includes making cities free of urinary bladders, vaccine collection, transportation for garbage collection, scientific cleaning, efforts for changes in habits, capacity building and cleanliness.
This survey , various waters go and make the cities their own .
Talk to the citizens and take their opinion.
The Cleanlin Synthesis App is used to assess changes in various services locations.
Through this survey the arrangement of cleanliness in cities is done in the cleanliness of the city or the lifestyle of people .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also a big responsibility of every Pauri , every species .
In the days of coming the days of Jagboo in this survey participating in this survey is participating with enthusiasm .
In this survey you should try hard without your city, your place, behind your streets.
It is my belief that for removing the dirt of your house , dry garbage the use of blue color , green colored bottles has become a habit of all of you even today .
Reducing garbage , using again , use of rehabilitation is very beneficial .
In the sanitation survey conducted between 4th January to 10th March, 2018, in this healthy competition related to hygiene, you need to discuss this thing in every city as well.
Our city- our endeavour, our development - is the progress of the country.
Come , let us try to fulfil the culture of clean India once again with this culture .
Beloved my country residents look very small to see some things but society has a lot of effect on our identity .
I would like to share one such thing with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Who has formed such a rule .
Why is the necessity
It is said that when I went in deep depths then independence came and independed such a way that we were able to know that we were moved .
decades Muslim women have done unrighteously but no church is celebrated .
There is no rule of this rule in many epidemic countries .
But Muslim women in India do not have this right.
Our government has given me a lot of happiness to pay attention to this thing .
Normally, Haj pilgrims are given permission by the latri method but it is my opinion to keep camel women away from this lottery method.
Our women should also be able to get equal power as men and in the progressive process they should also be able to provide equal opportunity to them to walk like men.
Dearly my country residents , January 26 January is a historic festival for us .

My beloved countrymen, December 5th, the world soil day.
This conclusion I want to tell some things with my Ratu brother , Sodariman .
The most important part of pelvis is mud .
The substances which we eat are mixed with this soil .
One way the whole food chain is covered with soil.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life possible .
How is the cost of living animals possible
This is the reason why we have been in the forefront of ancient times due to the importance of soil.
On the one hand, natural efforts have been made to nurture fruits, soils and soils and on the other hand some scientific methods have become a part of our lives.
Devotion to our soil, scientifically protecting soil, conserving both are important in the lives of the farmers of this country.
The rails in our country are associated with traditional traditions , trying to show interest in modern sciences , making attempts , making pride of all of us .
I have heard about the roses of Bhoraj block in Tohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
It is said that some rails of the village were considered to be the best condition of poisoning situation in the village , at the time of testing their soil , some kind of red , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes were included .
After that you will be surprised by hearing the results .
At the same time soil has also glittered in the cells .
If we want to think about the fruit then we should be cautious of the earthquake before . If we preserve the landmass , then the landmass will save us all .
All our farmer brothers and sisters across the country understand their soil very well, according to that they have taken soil health cards above ten crores.
We worship the mother earth but how much the health of landslide will be spoiled by red race .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the necessity of more than necessary damage of landslide has been proved .
Global Warming , changes in weather , all of us are experienced .
Sometimes before Deepavali the winter comes in front of Deepavali . Now December is coming slowly .
But as soon as winters dont let us all come out of the rays, it is an experience for all of us.
Going to 30,40 households everyday and talking about cleanliness, this kid got rid of excretion from the urinary defecation of Kumhari village .

For cleanliness it is necessary to do something everybody .
Our Divang brother , Sodarimans were strong .
The captains , adventurous people can contact anything .

In this middle youth , elders , children , adults , women , all adults also like Khadi , fishing .
That is why I can imagine how much benefits for the families of many working families , doing families , many poor families .
I said Khadi for fashion... now, I thought, Khadi for Nation, Khadi for Fashion takes all the places to Khadi for Fisheries.
Besides bringing about changes in the lives of the poor, both Khadi and Doing Business are also changing as a means of bringing them up with vigour.

I also got the opportunity to see a game .
I tell you that once I am the players , their partners , players , sports , ruins , ruins .
My beloved country , how many people come to me in the matter of clean India , if they want to judge everyone 's opinion then everyday I have to do the work in the mind of the heart only .
If one sends photographs to small children , then there are stories of the youth hair attempts at another place .
If there is any creative description related to hygiene at one place , then there is a news about changes occurring with some authority at other places .
In some days Christian a very expansive report has given me , in which there is the story of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra .
There an NGO called Ecological Protection Organisation took a cleaning program in Chandrapur fort .
In this program running for two hundred days people were running for cleanliness program without stopping , not getting tired , one team standing in a team .
Two hundred days in queue .
Before the program , after that photographs were sent me .
This Bhagirathi attempt done for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , literature , everlasting example .
Forts are our heritage symbols .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is the responsibility of all the people of the country .
I would like to convey my best wishes to all the people of Chandrapur and to the people of Thiruvananthapuram.
O people of my beloved country, on the fourth day of November, we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Apart from the first Guru Nanak Guru of Sikhs , Jagat Guru also .
All the species of T . . species have been seen together for their entire human cell .
Women have given importance to gloriousness of women , women .
Guru Nanak had travelled twenty eight thousand kilometres on foot and gave a message about the true humanity of this journey.
They talked to the people , they saw the path of truth , Tyaga , Karma .
He said that the society has been given a message about equality and not only through words but also through his works.
Guru Nanak had also discovered Gurubani to tell his words .
In the year 2019, we are celebrating the 550th glorious year of Guru Nanak Ji.
Come , let us try to move ahead on the Bodhina road of their message .
My beloved countrymen, after two days we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 31.
We all know that these are the foundations of modern India .
With the extraordinary journey of the great children of India we can learn how much .
On 31 October 31 Smt Indira Gandhi had left this fame .
And he said unto him , This is the same thing in doing counsel .
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel standing on the banks of India has been displayed .
Crores of Indians have decided to bring India under one country , one state .
Their decision has given them the power to face all obstacles .
Where there is need of entertainment worked with entertainment .
Where strength is needed , it has been done there .
They were moving ahead with complete effort to decide a goal .
This program which makes the country can be done every week .
Everybody imagined the country like that .
I would like his words to be inspiring for all of us - we should not stop the division between Kulamata.
This story of Sardar Riji is also an inspiration for our New India dream.
That is why their Jayanti is celebrated on the fifth day of the country .
Its support is unparalleled in giving a unique form to the country .
My beloved countrymen , after Deepavali Shells , with a new culture , with a new determination , you have started once again in your daily life .
All the residents of my generation want to wish all their dreams , ruins .
Through the sky all of you have spent three times while talking to your mind .
Italy is 36th in the mind .
I have never said these things in my heart .
And the corpses which I spake in this heart were not the words which the people sent me from all the corners of the country .
Many of these are my inspiration .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some people are like paying attention to some social problems , some social problems .
Once a month, I take your time for half an hour, but people keep sending their words to mind for thirty days in a month.
That is why in this mind the journey of all the people of the country , experienced feelings , experiences of all the people of the country .
I am telling thanks to all the people of the country for giving me the opportunity to understand the common poets of India in such a short time .
Now three - three scientists have been completed therefore social scientists , university scientists , researchers , media specialists definitely take their analysis .
But in the future of such poisonous churches how much useful is in the mind in future . a good memorial , new enthusiasm all gives .
After that I said that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have come to me .
Leaving food in Kanchenjunga in one place , how many people thinking that how many people were able to use it , how much happy I enjoyed .
Once again I had seen a photograph of Selfie with Daughter taken by a serpent in Haryana, I had spoken to everyone about it.
On seeing this, not only in India but also in the youth world, a big initiative called Selfie with Dater was started.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
Every girl has a new self-confidence , this is the incident of producing new pride .
Everybody felt that parents should take selphi with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has its own importance .
A few days ago I sat in the tourism department of India .
I said that if we go there with the people going for the journey then wherever we go in Incredible India we will send photographs there .
Then lacs of pictures coming from different parts of India , in a way all those working in the field of tourism were very rich .
I felt as much as a small incident can be lifted up .
And it came to pass , as soon as the thought of the fulfilment of the fulfilment of the fulfilment of the fulfilment of the fulfilment of the three incidents of my mind were mesmerised .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Every Paurudu , garden in the country wants to give something or the other for the society , for the progress of the country .
It is a matter of learning, listening and listening from the people of the country as a part of my three-three mind speech.
Any country has been kept very big , this is the biggest strength .
I worship the heart of all the people of the country .
I talked about Khadi once in my mind . Khadi was not a cloth , but a thought .
Discounts are given in Khadi mothers about two October and there is a lot of reduction.
I want to increase this Khadi procedure in such a way that I want to increase .
Due to the increase in the interest of Khadi patterns, there has also been an increase in the enthusiasm of those working in the Khadi sector and those associated with Khadi in the Government of India in a new angle.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the power of production , how to bring the mugs of the hands of soft power , how to revive the ancient tradition of 20-20, 25-30 years closed .
Many people have been produced .
He re-launched the closed Khadi and Rural Industries Training Centre at Pampore, Kashmir, which has a lot of work in Kashmir to provide this sector.
Now, in the beginning of the training centres, in the construction of new waves , in the direction of new things , in the middle of this big corporate institutions of Deepavali have enjoyed me a lot of fun .
People also started taking expensive things while giving gifts to each other .
How to move ahead naturally some things came into the experience of all us .
People of my beloved country , in the mind of the Christian month , we decided to celebrate the festival of cleanliness throughout the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti .
Our distinguished president had started this program .
Children , elderly , men , women , cities , villages , everybody were participated in the proposal of the advertisement .
As I said , we are watching the eyes in front of the eyes as I have said , in what way we are walking ahead .
Everybody has adopted this procedure , has provided his partner to support it .
That is why the jewellery of jewellery has told thanksgiving thanks to the president .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be its own work . Everybody has contributed with this procedure .
In Christians they , students , schools , art galleries , universities , rails , officers , polices , children , Jawans - everybody were connected with it .
These places are very polluted and people seem to be unsuccessful in Urukor and this pressure is also seen in those working there.
It is very good that more than seventy five lakh people, more than forty thousand people took part in this programme in the four days of the campaign of 'Swachhta Seva'.
Some consequences are continuously working with goals .
This time, we also recognise another new thing: holding one-sided programme, bearing cautiousness on the other side.
If you want to change cleanliness in a natural way , then Bhavogadh garden is also important .
Several competitions have been done by cleaning this time .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have made pictures .
The pictures about cleanliness with their own imagination .
Blessed are the media of the media when the word of the Christians is come , I have never forgotten .
We are witnessing the cleanliness of the country's electronic media, print media and the country.
In the midst of this somebody told me about the eighteenth day of Balal Dar of Srinagar .
You will be glad to know that this Bill Dar has been appointed as a brand ambassador for the Srinagar Portuguese incident and you will be glad to know whether he is from the cinema or hero of the cinema.
Not only .
Billa Dar had taken care of his twelve-three years of age , past five-three years .
He is the inspiration of all them that are zealous of cleanliness in the age .
Many congratulations to Billa Dar .
We should confess that my favorite country , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji Ridi , Pundit Din Dayalgiri is also the year of the century .
Do not know what is the center of all these great men
One common thing situated in everyone is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
Nanaji has left the life of the royal family of the country , it is natural to get the glorious glorious glorious gloriousness of their village programs .
The President of India, Shri Abdulla Kalam spoke to the youth about the development of Nanaji Deshmukh Grihaviour every time.
Like Mahatma Gandhi Ji the teacher of Din Dayal meditation also used to talk about the person sitting in the last queue of the society .
We also run ahead for one element , one element mantra .
We are generally telling the speciality of our India in diversity .
We take pride of diversity but at some time you try to feel this diversity .
It is near Deepavali that there is so much in the thought of going to some place in the country .
Going to every tourist is a common thing .
But it is a painful thing that people do not see our country, they do not know the diversity of the country.
Our country is full of many studies .
All these Mahabharatas have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work an attempt has been made to understand the country , to understand Bharat .
India has tried to live in itself .
My own experience is that I get the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend night in more than four hundred districts .
Not only does the unity of diversity say , but I want to feel the country of this large India , our unparalleled energy .
One India - the best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest strength of our country tourism .
My supplication is that if you want to take out something in your holidays , change Kosmo Baaldera , understand what you want to know , learn that you should go out with the goal .
Visit India inside you .
With these experiences your life will be rich .
Your thought is large .
There is no cost of experienced milk .
Normally from October to March is better for tourism .
Definitely send your photograph to the incredible incidence.
Send the pictures of humans connected to the place where you go .
Not only the identification of construction , but also not only natural beauty but also come about the lifestyle there .
Could you put it incredibly
You see, everybody from one state has to discover the beauty of the beauty of the state , I have to make a public literature about the seven places that have come in most of them .
The Government of India works on them .
In such best places by making pictures , videos , making publicity , encouragement , encouragement of them the government will adopt the information of beautiful , so many places from you .
Come , walk with me .
You can also become a big stimulation for encouragement to use in the tourism of the country during the month of October month of March .
I am invited to you .
My beloved country , many things of a man meet me .
My mind recognizes the mosquitoes .
Leave a deep effect on my mind .
How much I am man like you .
Why do Assamese say that while serving Mother India their husbands will not be heaven
In small age if the chest becomes dilapidated then how can we imagine their state .
Along with eleven months she trained with difficult industry , she gave her life to fulfil her husband .
Although the husband of Nilgiri Dubbad used to work in the army of Mukhsh Dubba , forget to die .
His wife also reached in the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of our maternal power, our glorious beauty of these vegetations.
I am telling many adventurous feelings of the heart of these two brothers .
They gave new inspiration , new excitement to the people of the country .
These two brothers were many opinions .
My favorite country , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festival is a big opportunity for our youth .

The weather is sacred , aromatic .
All around there is a environment full of spiritual environment , festival , devotion .
All this is considered to be the festival of Shakti .
It is also called Sharda Navratri which is now the beginning of Sharda .
O my beloved country , salute me , and worship me .
On the one hand, the country is enshrined in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to worry about the country when violative news comes from some corner of India.
This is the birthplace of Sardar Patel , the birthplace of Lord Buddha , Gandhi 's birthplace of the country .
" Ahimsa Parmo Dharma . " We came to hear it for a small time .
I have also said from the Red Fort that violence is not tolerated by the name of beliefs, it is a traditional belief, although it is the belief of the royal thoughts that Taluku believes, although one person believes in it, although he has a traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedakar all kinds of arrangements are available to get justice of every person .
If they take the chatti in their hands , who run on the Hinsa road , they are a person , they are a crowd , this country will not bear any government associated with the people of the country .
Our festivals are also full of many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we have got cultural heritage , cultural heritage , social traditions , historical events , historical events , everything , therefore in the year something or the other day is celebrated with some festival .
All our festivals also come according to the natural time .
All are directly related to nature .

My favorite country , today everybody is celebrating Ganesh Chaturth festival with grandeur .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturth it is natural to come to the subject of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival .

Now our festivals also change their attraction .
Navratri festivals in Gujarat, Durga Puja Festivals in Bengal have become their attraction in a way.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals Id-ul-Juha festival is celebrated in a few days .
My best wishes and congratulations to the people of our country on the occasion of Idul uha.
Festival meaning belief is a symbol of faith .
In the country of Navbharata festivals should be prepared as a symbol of cleanliness .
This is not new for us but it is the main habit of changing it into a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village , city , city , state , cleanliness , cleanliness in our country should be made a special part of our country .
My favorite country is changing the meaning of modernity .
Nowadays, no matter how new you are, no matter how fresh your thought process is, all these things are a new angle, a new measure, a balance has been created to give Beriju.
Therefore during these festivals everywhere a suitable soil of environment has started .
If you see in the youth , then in every house children are making mud gradually colored .
Some vegetables become colorful , some colorful pieces of paper .
The people of the media House are also giving inspiration to the people giving inspiration to the education of making idols of Ganapati according to the large environment .
See how big change has come .
A funny change.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts like crores .
It 's a lot of fun if someone has done new inventions .
Some engineer himself told me that he got some special kinds of soil , mixing it , giving training to the people making soil .
After worshipping this Ganesha in a small bucket , the idol melts immediately in water .
Three years ago, I started a cleaner garden and the coming October will complete two-three times.
The consequences of this park are seen .
The construction of the rectum has reached approximately 67 from 39 .

In such a scenario, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers at Dhanera in Banaskanta district of Gujarat had cleaned the flood affected twenty two and three mosques in a spectacular manner.
They saved everyone after worrying their sweat .
The attempts to make dedicated to the emotional nature can fly at a height of our country .
In one way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja is considered to be the first worship of Durga .
Go to the nearby villages , go to the nearby villages but consider this as a garden .

My beloved country , specially I want to accept all your favorite countries .
With heartfelt gratitude, I express my gratitude to all of you for not being able to connect with the words in my mind, but also for meeting millions of people from all corners of the country with me in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people are coming north , sending messages , giving message through phones this is like a big monkey .
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the words of all the people of the country .
As much as you wait for words in your mind , more than that I wait for your messages .
They come to work as a gynaecologist .
Once some things get so much mixed in our habits , we are ignoring that we are ignoring .
"Prime Minister Garu, I am speaking depthfully from Pune.
I want to tell you about my friend.
When she is trying to help people but a habit of her own has merged me .
I went to the shopping mall once with him.
On one sarasam two thousand rupees were expensively expensive .
Pizza has been given Rs. 450 but with the auto driver going to shopping mall, barasa has been made for five rupees.
The vegetables of vegetables on the way are swallowed 4,5 rupees on one vegetable .
I didn't like it.
Not only this , if you go to buy sarasam in the showroom then it is not possible that if someone comes to work with poor people then there is no unconsciousness .
Do ye ever think what does the poor do
There is no importance of two rupees , five rupees in your life , but how deep you can wound the minds of your small habit .
I am grateful to you for telling me through your phone call about such a heart attack .
My country is also a habit of walking with their poor , they believe that they will surely change .
My favorite youth , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country on the day of national year .
This is the birthplace of great hockey player , hockey midwive Major Dhyan Chandri .

The reason for remembering this thing is that my desire to be faced with the emotional sports of our country .
Sports should be part of our life .
On the occasion of the youth of the world we should also be seen in the game of that youth .
One type of sports is a big medicine for mixing mind .
Come forward in the youth of our country ............................................................................................................................................................
Play FIFA on computer but sometimes in the open field also show office with football .
Cricket keep playing in computer but playing cricket under the sky in sixty fields is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , whenever they sell .
Now the situation is such that children in the house are also drowned in seeing photography , cartoon cinema or mobile gam .
Youth friends , Christians have prepared a sports to glimpse , glittering sports portal .

There is a very big role in change .
Every student in life due to its natural creation in the attempts to bring changes in each other 's life , sometimes there are incidents happening at some time .
If we try to contact , then we can play a big role in changing the country .
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Teach to Transformation'.
"Prime Minister Garu, my name is Dr.
Annaya condition .
I will be staying in Mumbai city. Howard University will work in its Indian Research Centre.
I have special interest in financial inclusion , the economic collections related to it .

The new families of three crore new families have opened Jatapricha , Bank Khatas .

He has become a habit and is going to Bangkok.
But now it is understood that due to the environment formed gradually he also works for the needs of children .
It is understood that in the days of coming if you want to do some good work then money will work .
Now the poor seeing the Rupe card of his pocket , like rich people see himself as if there is a crade card in their pocket , there is a rupe card in my pocket .
It is considered its pride .
In the prime minister January about 65 thousand crores of rupees have been celebrated in the banks of our poors .
In one way this is their power in the days of coming to the poor .
Those who are expensive by the prime minister January , they also got the benefit of Bima .
On getting the obstacle of poor , if the main person dies in the family , in some days they get two lakh rupees .
Reproductive vaginal irrigation , insulin card , prime minister Mudrath , ordinary people have done any benefit for common people .
I will make a complete attempt to reach them .
Because of such inspirational incidents the media can also get complete benefit .
Such people can give new inspiration to new generations by publishing their face .
My beloved countrymen , once you all have ' irritation ' - if you are suffering from pain .
In rainy season the mind of man remains very important .
Animals , birds , sheep , nature , everybody changes the joy of rains .
With the changing weather cycle changes are happening in the environment and its effect is also very fast .
In the last few days due to extremely attractive natural obstacles in Assam , North-Eastern regions of India , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal has to face natural obstacles .
My friends in the Ministry are also reaching that place if possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the problems of flood in their methods .
In such situations the support of people is being helpful in social institutions , cultural institutions , services .
The Government of India will be happy to assist the Military Jawans , Air Force Week, ADRF , Ardha-Senior Forces in such times to help their lives .
The life of people becomes very impossible by floods .
Fruits , animals , economic customs , roads , electricity , meditation etc all get affected .
Especially when we destroyed our brethren , fruits , they were not destroyed , they made an excellent plan to make insurrection companies , specially the institutions of the fruits , climate centres , they were done immediately .
In order to face the situations of flood the control Rum Help Line is working continuously for 24 hours .
People are also telling their difficulties .
Gradually we also do our work according to the information of this environment , we can save us from harms .
When I am ready for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I feel that more than I have become more people of the country.
I am very impressed by listening to your Chartered Accountants Day .
Last month, Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into force in our country.
That is why you can say whether the government wanted fruits in the last months or not .
I want to know your thoughts in this matter .
It is a matter of great happiness and joy that whenever I came to North from the lice, I felt very happy and happy that because of GST, the price of goods that they are buying, how cheap things are available, how good things are available.
Especially the businessmen have increased belief on the businessmen .
I am seeing the impact of GST on transport and logistics.
How fast changing straight change , fast migration registration has produced a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technologists of the economy will sometimes stand before the world as a sample of the use of GST in India.
This is a case stadium of all the world university .
Because with the efforts of such a big height , so important change , so many crores of people in this large country it is a very big work .
Definitely researches on this matter .
All the decisions have been taken concentrated by the state , central governments .
The result of the concentration of the concentration of any kind of weight should not be lying in the eye of the poor .
Whatever was the price before GST, how much is the price in the new situation today, all these things can be easily understood through your mobile phone in the GST yp.
How easy , friendly atmosphere has been formed between the government , businessmen , how important role has played this role in providing faith between the government , government .
I am told that all the Ministries participating in this programme, all the departments, centres, state governments and governments have expressed their priorities to my heart.
GST is an important example of Indias collective strength.
If you want to say one way , this is a social collection .
On the second time I am making such a big attempt to successfully victory the fort of all the people of the country like Kotla .
Beloved my country residents , August i . . Vipla month .
On 1 August 1920 we started listening to the help of 1 August .
uit India Movement was launched on 9th August, 1942 which is also known as August Viplay.
In 1947 August 1547 the independence of the country came .
Seeing a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also specially associated with the history of freedom fight .
Our new generation should know what happened in the 9th honey of August 1942 .
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country were immersed in the freedom struggle for the independence of India, which was the inspiration for the creation of our emotions.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives through the mantra of 'Do RD'.
Lakhs of youths stopped their readings , left their books .
Great men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played a major role in the garden.
The uit India Movement in 1920 and the uit India Movement in 1942 showcases both the forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, a great man like Mahatma Gandhi had also given the mantra of 'Do RD', which is behind all the masses.
I would like to say that once the history of India has been roamed, the first freedom struggle of India began in 1857.
Then the starting independence of independence is happening in some corner of the country of 1942 .
This surgical period has produced the job of independence in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody has become determined to decide something or the other .
In 1857, 1942, this industry, conservation and conservation reached the last stage of the day of 1942.
The number of uit India National Park has changed so much that in 1947 English had to leave the country in 1947 .
In 1857 AD this independence reached all the people of this independence in 1942 .
Besides this 1942 along with the five dollars of 1947 along with the five dollars of all the people were successful in providing freedom to the country .
These five stools are like a spot .
Now I will mix you with a past .
In 1947 we came to freedom .
Now 2017.
Approximately seventy years have passed .
Governments came .
The arrangements have been made , Marai , increase , increase .
Everybody tried to come out in the problems of the country everybody in their own way .
As far as I was past 2017 the five dollars situated in 2022 are also like the contribution of five dollars .
Try to fulfil them .
As the five miles from 1942 to 1947 were miles to the independence of the country.
These five dollars i . . from 2017 to 2022 . India should also be done in such a way for the future of India .
After five years we celebrate the freedom fighters of the country .
Therefore all of us should make a strong alternative .
2017 should be done annually .
Every Indian, social organisation, local institution departments, schools, art galleries, different institutions, everybody is committed to New India.
Come , let us become a part of this cultural festival .
Therefore, I invite my young friends and young colleagues, especially from the online world, to come forward to support them in creative ways to build a New India.
Bring new ideas like video , posts , blocks , films , new ideas using technology .
We forget this procedure .
I am also inviting uit India uiz for young friends at the NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is useful in recognizing the glorious history of our country and introducing freedom fighters.
I believe that you will surely make a comprehensive proposal to this endeavour, spread all directions.
Beloved my countrymen, on 15th August, I get the opportunity to talk to the people of the country from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
The nearest airport from Red Fort is Karipur International Airport .
There is an attempt to give the form of words to their dreams . In the last three years there is an attempt to talk about the various aspects of the country from 15th August to 15th August .
This time also I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three August 15 deliveries I have heard that my delivery takes a long time .
Therefore I decided to reduce the time of my progress this time .
Beloved my country residents , I proposed another thing .
In the economy of India there is a social economic economy .
We should never take it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only pleasant .
Our festivals , our festivals are also social cultural heritage .
But along with this our festival is also directly linked with the economic life of every festival .
In a few days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinayak Chauti , after that Chauti Chandra , Ananta Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
In the economy related to economy Rakhi for a few months before Rakhi in lakhs of families Rakhila starts preparing in small domestic industries .
The people who make Rakhi , Rakhi sellers , sweets , thousands of people who make sweets , the daily business of thousands of people get engraved with a festival .
The families of our poor brother , brothers and sisters were spent because of which .
Not only a festival of lights but also a festival to bring luxury to the house .
Its relation is directly connected with the poor families to make small soils .
But I am talking about the festivals , while talking about the economy of the poor people lying in contact with those festivals , along with them I also want to talk about environment .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are more unsuccessful , active .
In the last months the best people were written to me for environment .
125 years, 125 crore people of the country.
At the same time, we will say that for environment conservation environmental conservation , environmentalist Ganesh i . . soil Ganapati is worshipped .
I am telling many other festivals of different festivals coming to all the people of the country .
Beloved my country residents , electronic , economic , social area , sports , sports , our girls are continuously going to give new goals .
All the people of our country are also prideing to see our girls .
In some days Christian women of our country have exhibited a unique sports in the competitions of the world .
In this week I got the opportunity to become Bhenti with those games .
I enjoyed talking to them but I realized that they were very heavy because the world was not able to win the camp.
In their Mughals also this disappointment , tension were removed .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw in many sports to break on them with anger .
If you are not able to spend the hearts of 125 crore people .
I told the archaeologists that in reality our country is youth , especially our girls .
Once again I am telling the youth of the country , especially our girls the impressions of my heart and feelings .
I am also reminded of the 75 years of our independence for the year 2022.
Make a significance of five paths for its cultural heritage .
The beauty of the country , future is excellent .
Blessed is the blessedness of all of you .
It is an experienced sensitivity that how much struggle we are, how much struggle we are, how much stress we are, whether it is a free life or a peoples life.
In many parts of the country, the Jagannath Rath Yatra is being celebrated with great sacred fervor.
This festival is celebrated in some places of the world now .
People of Arunachal Pradesh have engraved a deep experience with Lord Jagannath .
Jagannath Bhagwan is a revered goddess.
On the occasion of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath Bhagwan, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens of the country and pay my homage to Lord Jagannath.
There is also unity in diversity in India's specialties.
Around three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village.
On the occasion of Ranjan, it was decided that the rural population should be connected and constructed.
Uttrakhand and Haryana have also joined the gathering this week.
Then our habit will not change.
Cleanliness is also the same.
We have to constantly strive to get rid of such evil practices.
The incident took place in Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Its goal is that during an hundred hours the construction of 10 thousand records was done in 71 gram Panchayatti .
Beloved my country residents , during an hundred hours the government , people mixed with ten thousand people give you an unparalleled happiness .
71 villages have changed into villages without excretion .
I am giving many opinions to the Pauls of that village of Vijaynagar district working in the government , government officers , Vijaynagar district .

Some TVs related to it have come in the chest .
At the same time we should understand that yoga is a unique medium for Bhadrata .
(Sound Bit) I speak to Dr. Anil Sonaran from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, the Honourable Prime Minister.
I want to ask you a question .
What can we do if it is being implemented throughout the country
I got the opportunity to remember the ovary of forgetting the chronic ovary .
When I was the main minister of Gujarat then I decided to give books instead of flowers or we want to welcome with handicrafts .
Immediately I started giving those countries to the government .
Gradually it should change a part of our nature .
A flower blooms for some time .
Take it in hand once , leave it again .
I am describing such a school which has historical importance .
And it came to pass , when the last year went to London , that the British queen Elizabeth called me to eat .
The shawls made of cotton which gave me a glimpse of lightening in her eyes .
And it came to pass on the day of his lips , that the ruins of this hand were left in the marriage of Mahatma Gandhi , which he gave him in the marriage .
The beauty of Mahatma Gandhi is surprising to keep the queen of Elijibet queen at home .

I know that such good habits do not come at night .
There is complete transparent transparent .
Government officials will examine the details of servicing of persons registered in EGEM.

In the memory of the incident happening for some days Isro Jisthat was used as victory over 19 .
This is very heavy in the museums sent in the space of India .
On June 19th honey Mars Mission completed a thousand days .
It is a matter of your knowing that for Mars Mission we have chosen a place as victory in space .
The arrangement of this machine is 6 months .
To complete a thousand days is an important step in the space journey .
Along with studies youths also participate in the programs of Christians . All these are the talents of the future of their brightness .
Our sports have reached the pride of our country in the form of pride in our country with the victory traditions . our fame spread all over the world .
Italy was the Badminton player of our country , Shri Kidambi Sri Kant Indonesia Open .
I heartily congratulate Shrikanth and his coach for this great victory.
In the development of personality sports play a unique role .
Sports are very important in the construction of the person .
There is no dearth of every part of our country .
If children like our families then give opportunity to vomiting in the game .
After bringing water from the field of sports , binding in the room does not change the worms of books .
Along with the study they should also put in front of the students in front of the students in the school , in art gallery , in art gallery all the places in the family .
All Indians move ahead in the direction of meeting new dreams of Olympics .
But we were waiting for rainy season .
I am talking with you this day the sacred Ranjan month started .
My heartfelt wishes to the people of India, particularly the Muslim society of the world, for the sacred Ranjan month etc.
In the month of Ranjan prayer , spirituality , spirituality gives a lot of speciality .
Our ancestors really for us to make our ancestors a tradition of pride of all our Indians .
To stay in our country all the traditions of the world we should pride all the residents of our country .
There are goods in our country , Nastika .
The statue is dedicated to the idol , there is a opposite to the idol .
Such Siddhatalu , such worshipping places , such traditions , such traditions have done digesting the art of staying connected to us all .
Religious , traditional , principle , custom give us one message - peace , unity , impossibility .
This sacred Ranjan is helpful in moving ahead on the path of peace , unity , goodness .
I tell everyone again .
Its many people gave me a lot of happiness .
Everybody enthusiasm to tell their things .
All I could not read , everybody could not hear at least all the messages came .
But I have seen consciously that some try to learn music , some try to learn new music , some try to learn new things with the help of the youth , some try to learn new languages .
Some are learning along , some are learning dance , some are learning , some were also learning poets .
Try to know about nature , live , understanding direction .
I want you to hear a phone call.
I am speaking Diksha Atal ji.
I read all the habit of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the freedom struggle then I understood that how much we had to fight for India's independence, how much sacrifice we had to give, how many freedom fighters had spent in the jails of the freedom fighters.
How much adventurous Kirtishan Bhagat Singh has influenced me in small age .
Therefore, I would like you to give a message to the youth about this thing.
It gives me great pleasure to learn about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
The great men who were counted had lost their youth in the jail .
In the freedom fight the great men who spent in the jail , reading , writing etc . have done a very big work .
We know that everybody has given a lot of power to the independence of India .
Many years ago I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman Nicobar.
The poets used to come on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
Woe to the lovers of freedom lovers
When I read the book Savarkar Ji Maji Janmath, I was keen to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
I would surely say to the youth of the country that what kind of difficulties people have experienced for our freedom, how many difficulties they have faced, when they go to the Cellular Jail and say that Kalapani is there.
If you are also possible then in a way definitely go to this pilgrimage related to our freedom fight .
O my beloved people of my country , on Monday in 5 months of June .
If you want to say another thing then back to Basics.
If you want to be seen with nature , to increase better platform .
Who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi Ji
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times that 'one must care about a world one will not see'.
That is , we should also think about the world not seeing , take care of the world .
You will keep in mind , the power of nature is that when a glass of water is tired properly then how freshness comes .
On getting tired very tired , opening the windows , opening the doors , sucking fresh air new chaitan comes .
That is why the attempt of the world to be covered with the nature of June should also be given our own attempt .
Our ancestors are now available to us as a result of protecting environment .
It is said that the reason behind cleanliness of our body is prior to hygiene .
When Lord Buddha had discovered Lord Buddha then it is a matter of coming out that the birth of Lord Buddha , his knowledge , his Mahaparinirvana had been done under a tree .
Reading , readers , city residents , villagers , tribals , everyone naturally is a part of their social life .
But we need to keep this thing in mind with modern thoughts , modern thoughts .
In the midst of this I get bitterness from the states .
That is , in approximately all the states the program of planting plants starts .
Plants are planted in crores .
Yoga exercise is not only .
Keeping in mind the day of yoga for two days I came to the north of all the governments of the world .
Christian year I declared some competitions related to yoga .
Gradually the tasks of that direction move forward .
It's a very interesting advice.
Mother , mother-in-law , mother-in-law , mother-father , mother-father , mother-father , sons , daughter-in-law , one-three generations of yogasana should be put in the photographs by putting yogasana .
Nine , today , to morrow this beautiful yoga gives a new dimension to yoga .
Just like we have gained a good interesting experience through ' selfie with doter ' policy .
These three waves wearing yogasana definitely give exhibitions of the country , worldwide .
If they have done yoga for three generations then they should definitely send me the photographs of yogasanas together .
In a way it's called a positive health care park.
Since then, I have already visited various places in India.
While returning I noticed that some people are doing very minutely , where are they going
If you hear this phone call then it will be understood .
Modi Garu , I have often seen in this middle of TV , Social media media that everywhere you go people are taking special care about cleanliness .
On Mumbai , Surat I . . on your adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous purity of crowds .
Cleanliness Taluku, which you have started from Kashi Ghat, has become a motive inspired by you . "Your words are true.
Wherever I go, the government will organise cleanliness programme in the government machinery but in the midst of this, cleanliness has also become a festival.
Five days before I go , seven days ago , very big cleanliness programs are organized .
You can imagine how much interesting all these things of the country , not paying attention to this thing , you can imagine how much fun .
I am telling you that I will also appreciate all those who encourage this cleanliness programme.
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of reality is very tasty .
I do not know whether I can do it .
Modi guru , when you decide your tourism then do you want any kind of tourism , they want to say 'Babu , if you want to call me then how much will your cleanliness level be
The alternative is good but I should think .
But such a garden should be made . It is a very good thing to clean the garbage of so many tonnes that it is very good .
By doing this many people are saved from the grip of diseases .
The Government of India has decided to start an important programme on vain management with the help of state governments, with the help of the specific citizens of the cities.
On the day of June 5th World Environment Day , approximately 4 thousand cities of the country are being used for adopting vains in the form of liquid .
Two types of garbage are available . one is a colorful diabetes , other blue color diabetes .
All these work properly in the fields . fields are green , keep in mind that what is reminded in the garbage of green leafy vegetables .
Several other types of dry pockets like dry poppy seeds, glasses, glasses, glasses, clothes, plastic, polythene, polythene, rubber, metal etc.
In the last few days you must have heard that Versova Beach has turned into a clean, beautiful Versova Beach in Mumbai as a garbage area.
Approximately 80-90 weeks later, the city dwellers laboured and changed the form of this Versova Beach and after being removed from that place, the Versova Beach became clean and beautiful.
Its full responsibility has been taken to Versova Residence Volunteer -LRB- VRV -RRB- .
Shri Afroz Shah was gradually elevated to the programme on October 1, 2015.
Beloved my country , in the last fifteen months of the last fifteen months , TV Chanels , Social media , three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-
Three-thirds ago, you gave me the responsibility of 'Primary Service'.
Several surveys , opinions have been done .
All these procedures I adopt healthy information .
In every test all these three feet were tested by putting all these three legs .
Every part of the society has polluted it .
There is an excellent process in delivery .
I am telling blessed to all those who have given special feedback .
On coming to the light of Lopalu , Lopalu one gets the opportunity to correct them .
It is good , something good , bad , learning something from it , walk ahead with the evening .
Constructive examination strengthens the delivery .
This massage is necessary for an entire country , for a conscious country .
This is the thing that many families had come to me .
One person Gunnu , one ordinary Pauri has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
While sitting at such a big place, I would like to recall the distinguished guests, President Reiki, President Reiki and Speaker Reiki for giving me so much importance in Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, the programme of 'Mansoon' has given a new direction to the programme.
Some of our friends have talked to me sometimes while working on the book 'Book in Mansu'.
I am familiar with Akbar River .
Beloved my country , this time we keep raining throughout the country on meeting with our beloved country .
Come , let us all walk ahead loved nature in this environment .
Blessed is the blessedness of all of you .
O my beloved people of my country , worship .
Probably arrangements , people have become a habit of these problems .
Children 's curiosity , youths , elders etc . are coming in my sight .
If someone coughs while traveling in the bus , train then immediately someone comes and gives advice to something or the other .
Advices , suggestions are in our nature .
Many people try to give me advice , advice to give me something or the other in their life .
With the instrument of some good hand changes their Buddha , power , capacity according to the situations .
Some people also tell the advice of their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a collection for everyone with the purpose of changing .
Not only this when I propose something then it feels very happy to remember such things .
After that many people from all parts of the country of Narendramodi Application , MyGov have said that they have made some creative attempt to see food waste .
I also sent some videos .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the foundation day of one , Maharashtra , Gujarat states .
This contribution is many ruins of the people of these two states .
Crossing many new developmental peaks of both the states has continuously provided their support to the progress of the country .
In both the states the everlasting attempts , every kind of society of the society keep on recognizing their life .
While reminding these great men , on the day of the state's consciousness , on the day of independence i. e.
Make a plan to read this cultural program . Walk ahead with the help of all people .
On the second time there are many ruins of these two states .
The rapidity of summer staying in the months of May , June this time has to be felt in the month of March , April .
Therefore this time I consulted advice to talk in mind , more advices have been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also published , but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that balcony should be kept water for birds , daba .
In many families small children also saw this work .
Once from the point of view of their point of view this work , if birds come here ten times a day or if there is water in the bowl .
We get such a game but in reality this is a unique experience of lifting up the feeling of experience in the minds of psychological mind .
Although in our country the subjects related to natural life with animals , nature are known well but it is necessary to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the chief minister of Gujarat , Daudi Bohra Samadhishwar had come for hundred years .
He lived an hundred three times .
On the day of his hundredth day the Bohra society of the festivals has been running a very big garden for preserving the pictures by their Burani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
Approximately fifty two thousand birds have been sent to all parts of the world .
This has also been evaluated in the Guinns Book of World Records.
Sometimes we were not able to take so much that they used to put paper , milk , vegetables , Post Man , such a time when somebody drinks good water in the gate during these summers .
Friends , I want to tell you some things as well .
Sometimes many people in our youth like to spend life in contact zones .
Mother 's parents are also milking their alternative in a protective environment .
Its residents are also present but most of the comfort zones are seen .
Now the tests are done , to enjoy the cells are put .
After summer season the cosmetics remain alright .
I want to tell you how to spend your summer holidays like a friend.
It is believed that somebody has done experimentation , it is believed that I am .
If you want to hear this , do not think , go to unknown place .
Try to new places , new experiences , new experiences .
I want that if your interest is in this summer holidays then try to know them .
Give new use .
Use should be positive . You should take you out of your comfort zone .
We are of happy families of the middle class .
What are the matters of those travellers , what do they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to the bus terminus filling moments with your foot balcony , walnut or other games .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see that you will get the joy of enjoying life in playing games .
If such children spending such life in the society get the opportunity to play with you then what change comes in their life .
If you also go once then I can say with the belief that you want to go again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
The ill effects of technology has come to decrease the borders , but its ill effects have changed how six humans living in one room are also in one room to imagine the beauty of far away from them .
Away from technology can you try to spend time with you
If we pay attention to our country full of many studies then we will get to learn something or the other nearby .
Not only this , learn this swimming , do not come to the best idol , try to give something or the other on the pocket .
Sometimes we felt as if we want to do small tasks then we can not learn some tasks .
You can learn to walk but whenever you want to learn auto rickshaw .
You may have to trek a cycle but do you ever try to drive a trichakra car carrying people
You see , these new attempts , new experts can not only give you happiness but also pull your life tied in one situation .
Keep showing Indraja to your friends .
I am talking with my experience , how much learning the world is possible to know how much we are not able to imagine .
New places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But wherever we go before going, it is a different joy to go to that exercise, to see a memorial there, to know, to talk to people, to ask people, to see those places and to see those places is a different joy.
Therefore you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New generations are getting rid of the Naga river nearby .
They do not need the river .
He began to believe digital consciousness .
Do you also believe it , but do you ever think that you can get it done through this plan
The Government of India has made a plan .
You must've been loading down the BHIM App.
Send it to each other .
If you do a day with twenty people then in the evening you will get two rupees .
This plan is incomplete till 14th October .
Your cooperation will thus be in building a 'Digital India'.
New India will become one of your companions .
Have a holiday , accomplishment for holidays .
Refer - enjoy .
Normally in our country there is adverse environment of ViP culture .
Now red light has gone on vehicles , the red light entered into the brain has not been able to say loudly .
Namaskar Prime Minister Garu, from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, I am talking to Shiva Choubey.
I'd like to talk a little bit about the government decided red beacon light ban.
It seemed very pride to me .
Now my time has also been so important .
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam.
I want to know the blessedness of my heart for this decision .
Red Fort is a part of the Red Fort by the Government .
New India is the spirit of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country.
If IPI is in place of VIPs, my feelings are clear- Every Person is important.
Every person has the importance of every person , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is the power to do great dreams of 125 crore people of the country
Do this work together .
Beloved my country , we will always tell our history , our culture , our traditional repeatedly .
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year all our 125 crore people of the country are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Swami Ramajacharya .
No matter how much we are not able to fulfil any reason , how small is thinking that most of the centuries are thinking for a century .
Imagine cosmetics .
These are also so difficult to take out the social chains of society .
How was it before thousands .
Ramajacharya had done a very big fight against the bad , descriptions of the society , unparalleled species , species etc . during his time .
He embraced the society by his own jewellery , who embraced everyone .
Before a thousand he got the permission to give them entry in the house , and got the permission to enter into the house of all them .
We are fortunate to have great men from our society to end the evils of the society of that time in every era.
Today, we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramajacharya, we have been inspired by him in an effort to promote social unity.
To morrow the Government of India has released a Tapala Billa in the memory of Swami Ramajayana .
I am offering adventurous options to Swami Rama .
Beloved my country , to morrow one more speciality is Tarikh .
It is celebrated as the day of labour at many places in the world.
It is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar on the day of tribulation , when there is a discussion about tribulations , then it is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar .
It is said about Babasaheb Ambedakar , Swami Ramajacharyas , if the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society is also being reminded .
In the twelfth century he had given deep thoughts on the subject of suffering and labour.
And it came to pass , when he was come to pass , that he said , Cailas .
It means that you can achieve Shiva's house Kailash with your industry.
That is , by doing karma the heaven gets obtained .
If you want to say in the second thing , Shrama Shiva .
It is natural to remember the Gangtok while talking about the labourers .
People of my country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapurni .
All the followers of Lord Buddha are celebrated throughout the world .
I am fortunate to celebrate Vesak Day by the United States on the day of Buddha Purnima.
This desert is celebrated in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Buddha in Sri Lanka .
The opportunity to remember their memories is available .
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
Indias "Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas" is not only about India but also in the world.
Especially our neighbouring countries also come .
Our two countries should be associated with our neighbouring countries , development should take place for them .
Many experiments are done .
On 5th May the south - Asia museum of India was used .
This museum is capable of ability , how useful is the economic , economic , economic , development of South Asia .
This museum helps in the attempts of traditional culture between natural forests , tele-medicine i . . electronic science , educational sciences , people .
People of my beloved country , sunshine are strong , protect yourself , protect you .
Most of the families of the country are busy in the tests of their children .
In the families of the tested people the atmosphere of cosmetic environment , testing , cosmetic pressure remains in the families of cosmetics .
In such a situation, I can say one thing and listen to the words that I have told the students in Mansu.
In a historical war occurring against unrighteousness Bangladesh has studied the victory of Bangladesh in a historical war .
On such a special day independent Bangladesh brother Pauri , brothers and sisters wish to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh .
India will continue to extend full cooperation to Bangladesh as a strong friend and as a friend and assist in protecting peace and security in this Yavat region.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are pride to give us the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the symbol of our goddess Ravindranath Nagar .
An interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that he was the first person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 and the British also gave him the Knighthood title.
Rabindranath Tagore is also one .
This incident is a time of showing strong effect on the mind of one twelve children .
In childhood this Jalian Wildlife Sanctuary has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 this small devotion of twelve years is the beloved of all us , Amarvir Bhagat Singh standing inspiration .
These three days Christian March , 23th honeymoon of the month of March , he had climbed the excavation of two friends Sukhdev , Raj Guru Lanu English .
This incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru without death , without the death of three , we all know that the joy of service of India is left .
We cannot imbibe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Raj Gurus.
The British empire was afraid of these three .
The snakes were in the jail while they were in the jail , how did they have the British in slowly .
Therefore in the same way one has to get the training done on the 24th day of the month of March , on 23th March the training was done on the day of 23th March .
Besides this their dead goddesses were brought to the place of Italy Punjab .
A lot of years ago when I went to that place for the first time then a kind of species occurred in my body .
Whenever there is an opportunity, I am suggesting to the youth of the country to visit the shrines of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and other batkeshwar shrines.
At that time the call for freedom , its rapidity , its quantity is increasing .
On one hand these people like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Gurus inspired the youth of the armed opponent .
Right before the bridge of Italy on 1917 April 10th April the Mahatma Gandhi Champaran museum was established .
This is the century of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom fight of India Gandhi Vadam , Gandhiji behavior style for the first time was known during Champaran .
This incident is a milestone in the entire journey of fighting for freedom in the form of Portuguese method .
The Champaran Satyagraha, the Kheda Satyagraha, the Million Labour summit in Ahmedabad, showed a strong impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts, behavioural style and television.
A man who returned to India in 1915 was the only two-pronged activity.
Mahatma Gandhi has shown the miraculous power to know the nerves of the people, to fight against immunities, to inspire, to fight, to fight, to fight, etc.
If a person knows about Gandhiji during the time of Champaran Satyal Museum , then how is it impossible to know the museum of Champaran Satyal .

I travel everyday on a river polluting a lot of garbage .
Our house is hidden on the Rispana bridge of that river .
I am recognizing it .
I want to be angry in the minds of hundred crore people of hundred crore people .
Once anger starts , if there is jealousy , then we apply something or the other for cleanliness .
It is best , active participants are active , how important is their importance .
But cleanliness is also linked with a habit of more than garden .
I believe that this emotion awakened among the students and students of the country in Navratna and in the youth of the country is a good result on its own.

On making a psychological environment it starts getting rid of .
The first mantra is that instead of suppression x - ray is necessary .

Thank you for remembering the glorious example of glorious India, Bolead.
They have gained a place that is possible through technology, science and technology. They are protecting the poor from diseases, getting rid of the world.
The 15th February of 1973 is an honorable day in the life of Indians .
Our country has done an important work as much as we lift up the head with pride before the world .
He completed many unparalleled experiments in ISRO -LRB- ISRO -RRB- for some time .
A few days ago, ISRO established World Record in the field of space after successfully experimenting with Anganwadi, Mars Mission, Mangalyaan etc.
Once after sending 104 museums in space the history of history is standing in India for the first time .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th victory over PSA .

This space programme, run carefully with the lowest cost of ISRO, has become a marvel in the world
Scientists of India have displayed this victory with the heart of the whole world .
Brothers and sisters , these 104 museums are the main among these 104 museums of India Cartosat 2 .

This tuberculosis of the interception technology has achieved the victory of the enemies by identifying the tuberculosis of the enemies from a height of 100 kms near the ground .
Our Indian scientists have seen this .
And its strength is that if any tuberculosis comes from a distance of 2000 kilometres to attack India then our tuberculosis is capable of destroying it in space.
On seeing new technology , we enjoy some scientific new victory .
In the journey of human life Taluku has played a very important role in the journey of development .
Specially scientific , every genius does not let their memory remain like a memorial .
That is the reason of new research .
Scientists do not sleep , neither find peace to their questions .
If we look at the journey of thousands of years of development of human life, we can say that there is no such thing for the development of this human life-style.
So it is impossible .
Regular attempts are being made to know everything , creation rules , man 's mind .
Although every new technique , new science gives birth to a new age .
My beloved youngsters, science and scientists are talking about hard-working industries. I have been reiterating the fact that many times in Mann Ki Baat, I have enhanced the attraction of science in our youth.
There is a need of many scientists of the country .
Today scientists are becoming the cause of a permanent change in the lifestyle of the coming generations .
Mahatma Gandhi says they have no science dropped from the skies in a perfect.
When scientists keep in mind the needs of ordinary people , how can they use their principles naturally , what technology is beneficial for them , because how beneficial is the most beneficial for the common man .
To identify such creativeness , exhibition , exhibition of people , how would such creative inventions be used for people , how should they produce them high , how should they use them , how important they have done .
I had seen a precious decoration .
In 2005 more rains came in Mumbai .
Its meaning is that in the society , in the country , in this kind of role humans are very flourishing .
Our society is also very simple in the direction of technology .
All the arrangements are also run in the direction of technology .
In a way technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days the vaginal irrigation of design has been very strong .
Gradually people are moving ahead towards digital consciousness leaving the river .
In India also designal Ladwa Devi is developing very fast .
Especially the youth are adopted to celebrate their mobile phones from their mobile phones .
I think this is a good sign .
Just a few days ago, our country got a huge boost to the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'DG-Business Yojana'.

All our rails tell us that all our records were bound .

This year approximately two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
The name of our rails is more than 8  Namoda Akhri record this time .
This is so much successful .
I am especially impossible for the rails of the country .
Because besides traditional fruits they were able to keep in mind the poor people , various types of pulses have been able to fulfil the cereals because the poor get the most proteins with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of rails in the country nearby two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of pulses have enjoyed me a lot of fun .
This is not only the production of various kinds of pulses , but also an important service for the poor people of my country .
My prayer , all my supplications , my country rails have produced the record of pulses in such a way that my brothers and sisters have discovered special interests .
My dear countrymen, in our country, by the government, society, institution, everybody is doing something in a clean direction.
In a way, everybody appears to be behaving in some form or the other with regard to hygiene.
The government is also trying continuously .
Six houses were empty and repaired .
Twin Pit toilets have been empty , then the rulers have seen the methods of using those toilets again .
How do we clean other cleanses , these toilets can also be cleaned in such a way .
Because it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country when a ruler of AIDS has cleaned the toilets themselves .
It has also been proved .
For the family of six members a Standard Town is filled in five storeys .
After that the scum can be easily turned into another pit .
In six to twelve months the garbage reached in the toilet goat gets completely destroyed .
The government takes this way , others also use such a front .
Clean birds keep on continuously in various parts of the government .
In the first phase of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development is also going to give a boost to the Swachhta programme.

While asking in step they are moving ahead . They are increasing the country with their victory .

My heartiest congratulations to all of them.
On 8th March the whole world is also celebrated everyday .
The scheme of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is progressing at a rapid pace.
These are not only a government program .
As a social communication, Jan Bhagidari has become a programme.
Last two times this program attracts the minds of common people .

As soon as the girl was born , how much fun is being celebrated .
In a way the society of the girls increasing in the girls becomes the cause of their social civilization .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .

How much I am ignoring you for this help .
Manki Bath , August 2019 .
Today our country is enjoying rain on one side .
On the other hand some festival , fair Deepavali is held on the other side of Hindustan .
Perhaps our ancestors, in any situation, had created a system of living in the society like the menstrual cycle, the economic cycle.
Till this time we celebrated many festivals .
The birthplace of Shri Krishna Festival has been done throughout Hindustan .
The cost of such personality is that even after spending thousands of years every festival takes a new dimension , it gives new energy to anyone .
Today I am talking to you about two great monasteries .
One was Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan , one was the mohan of Charkhadhar .
When Sudarshan Chakradhari departed from the bank of the Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and established it in the city of Dwarka , then Mohn , born on the sea shore , came to the Yamuna shore , and spent the last churches of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used his intelligence , intelligence , intelligence to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop his intelligence , to stop his intelligence , his science .
At the same time, India is in the process of celebrating another big festival.
Not only India , this is the church of the whole world . O my beloved country .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the rails being recognized in Champaran .
In order to remove many misconceptions related to blood pressure they themselves have served the patients of blood pressure .
Services have kept their life for example .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
The person of Mahatma Gandhi , society , humans , humans were specially this .
Phoenix Farm of Africa , Talstoy Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardhana , all the places in their special way , the society of the society , computer Mobelization was dedicated to them .
All these emotions of society , society , community cervical cervix , mobilization we need to bring in our behavior life .
If you want to say the truth then this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
We are connected with people in the society , with all the classes , with all the age groups , the villager is a man or everyone associated with the society , what can I try to do my attempt .
The cost of the cost of my generation is good .
Common is our strength .
In the programs happening in this 150 years of age there should also be community , service .
Our women are Mandali Ladys Club .
Ladies Club's functioning in the modern era, but everybody will join a service programme comprising Ladies Club.
We can do a lot.
Adopting books , distributing knowledge to the poor , such 130 crore Indians can start 130 crores .
There is no point in the mind that if good aspiration, good conduct, goodwill, goodwill can be served with complete integrity then it would be enough.
It is also soothing . if it has been for a feeling of uneasiness then it is enough .
My beloved countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Salt Satyagraha is a very important milestone in the freedom struggle.
I will attend the inauguration of a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this others also write three words while expressing your emotions with those photographs .
During the time of coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been done .
But in this context a interesting thing I want to participate with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time Venice Biennale's Indian building has an interesting exhibition of Gandhi's memories.
In this Haripura Panels is specially interesting .
In Haripura of Gujarat the confluence of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of Subhash Chandrabos is so much reminded .
This art is a beautiful gap to Panel.
Prior to the Haripura meeting of Kangras, in 1937-38 Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan was invited by Principal Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wished to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through the medium of art.
This Nandlal Bose is the best art work of our state .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
This Boss reservoir has made its own immortality with the state of art .
Nandal Bose Haripura has made a heart canvas by touring the villages nearby , at the end of the rural life of India .
A great deal of discussion has been held in Venice about this precious art work.
I would like to make some contribution from Hindustan along with the good wishes of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Do something for the country , society , for others .
That will be Bapu's straightforward, realistic programme.
This time it starts from 11 September .
During this time we came out of our houses and dedicated the work of Mahatma Gandhi with hard work .
Houses , streets , but art galleries , but art galleries should be organised in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
I told that in August 155 hundred crore people of the country were encouraged by enthusiasm , energy . I told that in Bahraang places the work of getting rid of excretion from excretion .
And we all together stop Single Use Plastic's guy.
In this matter all sections of the society are enthusiastic .
Through this money remains , it plays its role in environment protection .
This time, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of 2nd October, Bapuji, the foundation for the opposite of plastic was laid not only for the people of Bahrang excretion but also for the people of India.
I'm applying to every village, every city residents of all the classes in the society.
This year we celebrated Gandhi Jayanti from the garbage of plastic to India .
All the Municipality , Corporation , district headquarters , village Panchayat Government , all the institutions , all the institutions , everybody , everybody has to be organised properly for the heap of plastic garbage .
I urge all corporate sectors to examine how disposal should be organised properly if this plastic hunt is restored at one place.
It can be recycled .
It can be fueled .
Today I want to tell a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of glory for food in our culture .
As much as we have also included information in science .
Poshan Abhiyan is developing modern scientific methods of nutrition throughout the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once a thing came into my eyes .
In Nasik, a major initiative was taken up by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
In it on the days of harvest anganbari servants of anganbari cereals from people .
Women use this grain to make hot food for children .
The person donating in it is a Jagrud Pauri society .
This culture is celebrated while feeding the first time of the child .
Liquid food is not solid food .
Saurashtra has taken a pledge in 2010 that why should not the need arise in this matter by giving complication food to children
This is very important before , which can be participated everybody .
In many states people eat food items .
A unique collection of service , joyful feelings is spectacular .
O natural beauty , in such small ways our country can be influenced by fighting with malnutrition .
Today the right information or poor , rich people are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as 'Nutrition Abhiyan' throughout the country.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was sure that a lot of questions would arise about it and that too.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went, there was a proposal for Man Vs Wild.
Whenever the opportunity of touching the hearts of the world has not been able to imagine my life .
But what happens .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I have a conversation with anyone in the world, I am going to talk to you about Yoga for five to ten minutes.
They do not discuss about yoga in the world 's biggest ground . This thing I am telling about the whole world .
Discovery Channel has planned to be published in their language in 165 countries .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate Jasts , clean environment in our country .
But one more interesting thing is that some are asking me one thing while hesitating , Modi ji , say this , you are talking in Hindi , do not Hindi .
Do not do the cost of edible after this .
Then what happened to the cost of shooting .
It is questioned very curiosity .
See , there is no secret in it .
Many people have this question in their mind . Okay , I will tell this secret now .
Actually this is not secret .
In fact, technology was completely used in a conversation with Bear Grylls.
Bear Grylls kept a small card lease in his ear because it was parallel in English.
Therefore while talking to him in Hindi it was a miracle of technology .
After this Samaria many people are seen about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places like nature , wildlife , living .
What's the nature
You will be able to see .
Your internal is also large .
On 15 August I made a request to you from the Red Fort that at least 15 places in the coming three places , 15 places in India are completely tourist centers .
You go, look, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought is large .
My beloved countrymen , in India the thought about environment protection , attention i . . conservation is natural .
In the last month I was spectacular to release the population of tiger in the country .
You will know how many thorns in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty and seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the corners .
In 2010, a lion was found in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In this information about reducing the number of tigers has been taken , one alternative .
The number of tigers of the world of 20222 is that contribution .
But now this new India will fulfil our goals quickly.
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of wilderness , computer reserves has also increased .
While releasing the lion data, I also recognized the Gir Singhs of Gujarat.
When I responsibled the responsibility there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was reducing .
We took several churches one by one in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women guards there was taken .
We have improved the infrastructure for increasing the tourist arrivals.
Whenever you talk about nature , wild animals then conservation is discussed .
But along with safety one should think about taking this church towards Karna .
Therefore it is not necessary to save forests , trees , wild animals , they should also give appropriate environment to increase in the right way .
My beloved countrymen, how can we forget the historical lecture of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
My beloved countrymen, you will remember that on 29th August, we will celebrate the National Creation Day.

Man Kibbat - word in the mind .

My young friends , you all know very well , I keep talking continuously in mind .
All the months of January , February , March , April are the time of every family .
In the house there are tests for two children , there is a need of test on everyone at home .
I thought that this is the right time to talk to the students , their students , their teachers , because somewhere I went , somewhere , these tests were seen to be a big problem .
Everybody gets to see family , students , students , students , everybody gets to see a unique mental environment in every house .
Seeing them I want to participate the thought that came in my mind .
I had a message of telephone from creation .
Listen , whatever creation you want to say , Sir , if I want to tell you , during tests , in our house , in our house , two houses , in our society a fearful environment takes place in our society .
Due to this reason students are encouraged more than inspiration .
People who enjoy happiness are beneficial .
That is why my goal is to consider a festival like a festival .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best time comes out in us .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
Which is the best .
Festival removes the environmental test .
That is why I told all my parents that you change all these three months into a very exciting environment .
Actually , from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , from Kutch to Kamrup , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh these three months are not tested .
Therefore I am calling 'Smile Mor, Scor Mor' to all of you .
If you are stressed then all the doors close , the matter does not go inside , the internal thing does not come out .
Nobody has to say anything .
Inside why did Venet remind that Meera had come out of the pressure .
Therefore , the important medicine to increase memory is that it is relax .
Through my own experience I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things but when relaxed then how many things are able to remember us .
Therefore, 'A Happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet' is the main thing.
Sometimes we start feeling that we are not able to see the right point of view .
It is not a life test .
How to live , how to live , how to live , how to test everything .
Apart from tests given by Not Book in Clas Room there are many other tests in your life hence , acquaintances are related to the guests of life .
.
Abdul Kalan is an important example in front of all of us .
He wanted to reach the airways .
Neither are they found .
Somebody had sent me a question of happiness . ' In this time there is a big challenge to see education in this time , education has become the center of test .
Therefore I want to know your thoughts about the future of education , its future .
"Their question is in their question but they want to know my opinion as well .
You say , on showing your family so much a family doctor will stay with you .
You will see his experience , knowledge , how much profit he is .
Rucha Garu was also known as 'Praspirth'.
This is a big psychological war.
The speciality of the life of many May players is that they competition with themselves .
Twenty years after asking his record himself , going forward by ship every time it is a unique life journey .
Because he choosed the way by the name of every exhibition .
Friends, you can donate the time of reading peacefully for three hours in every sphere of your life, even when you go for examination.
Before this they could not get up at the time to decide the cost of lifting up . Now they are getting up for regular time .
In such a situation the cost of the test is not able to sleep , but now it is not able to sleep .
It produces that energy inside itself .
If you want to say smoothly , if you are competitioning with anyone then you will find three important stores which are known before you .
Whatever he came - "My mother did not read much .
But sitting with me asked me to write .
Adopt it .
Use as much capacity as you are in your work , take time out .
If you learn to accept once then the main problems will end there .
Problem is believed to be conserved in the roots of the problem .
We were in the hospital with the heart of the person knowing very well .
Then the first Speaker of our India Ganesh Dada Mavalankar , his son , one time M . . Purushottam had come to see the hospital .
If you want to say that on meeting a person with illness we fear him by the name of disease .
I told the conservations that sometimes we also do this with children .
In the day of test if you want to make the situation of laughing simple to the child laughing then do you feel at any time .
Do like this , the weather changes .
I got a picture phone call.
And he spake not his name .
You will understand why he can not call the name .
Therefore I started trying a lot .
I tried to discover its methods so that my time has become very wasted.
The time to see how long time the attempts were made to see the burrow , how long time I was ready to read the same time , then the guests were gained .
Seeing how you see that it will swim towards the way to fail life .
If it is taken in tests then your life will be destroyed .
If you are not taken, then the guilt of life is not only in your mind but also in your mind.
If you have to tell your children then you can not talk about their eyes properly .
If you are also turning your roads into a pit then I have seen that some of the talents used in finding new methods to see how much they are invested, they spend their entire creativity for the methods of looking at them.
The same creativeness , on the same time it is not necessary to see at the same time .
What consequences are available with their own difficulties , therefore the self confidence of increasing self confidence is unique .
Your gurus , your parents angry me .
Because students consider that on paying attention to sports the meditation of studies decreases .
Definitely consultation .
It is necessary for the rest of the body also .
Give breakfast at least five minutes .
You will know that your work is easy .
Everyone likes it or not but it is my experience .
In such a time breathing deeply is very beneficial .
There is no need to stay in the room to breath deep .
If you see cosmetic sky then sit down to read again for five minutes after going to Dabba .
Some people feel as if they wake up all night but definitely give important sleep to the body .
Your concentration increases .
Freshness increases in you .
All your capacity increases properly .
When I participate in how many councils , sometimes my throat grows .
Once a folk song came to meet me .
If you sleep properly then you will get a lot of relief for your voice .
I recognised my sleep , my Pragati Gurinchi , never thought of my throat .
Okay , young friends , you are in an attempt to test , I have put you in words in mind .
I think that my words of Italy will surely give you rest .
The magnificence of the Tirthankaras is the magnificence of the Tirthankaras .
Along with their responsibilities the Christian team has done the program of cleaning the sea shore of our country .
Thousands of people participate in it .

Pribruary is the only festival of Tarikh .
On the fifth day of the spring in our country the festival of Saraswati is celebrated .

O my beloved people of my country , Namaskar . Christmas contact with you all .
Today, service, sacrifice and mercy have to give importance to our lives.
Jesus Christ said, "Not our comfort to the poor, but our comfort."
St . Luke had written in his goal that not only to serve his names , but also to serve the poor .
The story related to this is very well published .
It is said in that story that jeeeps are standing near a hut of Taluku Kosha .
And many riches came and gave many donations .
After that one poor pomegranate came and gave two copper coins .
Seeing in a way there is no big price of two copper copper coins .
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamanshi Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
This is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
The country of Atal Review does not forget forever .

The party has filled an ideal ideal in every utensil today , parlor member , prime minister , in every utensil .
His birth contact with his birth he has to give him the health of his straight health .
I got the opportunity to work with Atal River as a worker .
Many memories shine in front of the eyes .
In the form of a festival of Italy Christmas Festival people of the country have been benefitted by two stories .
If you want to say one way , two new elements start .
Everyone wants to learn, know each other.
In order to promote this thing, the Government of India has started a 'encouraging' scheme for consumers and small traders for promoting mobile banking and e-payment habits.
To encourage shopkeepers, "Lucky Grahak scheme" and "Digital Benefit Business Strategy" are being launched to encourage traders.
Besides the massage of 25 December , fifteen thousand people get a lot in the drama method .
This fifteen thousand people go to Khata everybody a thousand rupees .
After three months April 14th honey Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar Ji is a buffer dressed on the day of Jayanti .
"Digital Blessed Business Path" is especially for businessmen.
The traders themselves can also include shopping in it to change their business in this way .
Many people may be surprised, but there are 30 crore Rupee cards in India today, of which these Rupee cards are available with 20 crore poor families and those with Jan-Dhan mines.
Immediately 30 crore people can be a part of this multiple plan .
Beloved my country , how to use technology in the country , how to use technology in the country , how to see the necessity of online painting , etc . in the same way I am very happy .
In the past few days the trade of river trade , moneyless trade has increased from 200 to 300 percent .
To encourage it the Government of India has taken a big decision .
How big businessmen can estimate this decision very easily .
Those traders who celebrate Digital Ladwa goddesses, who develop online payment system instead of money in their business, such traders have been exempted from income tax.
For this, a committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu to discuss various schemes.
But the rest of the governments also started many myths in their way , I also realized it .
The Government of Assam has taken a decision to grant 10 percent subsidy to digitally repayment of goods and business licenses.
Approximately 2 digital Ladwa goddesses from 2017 January to March with 75 percent use of the branches of the rural banks have received a reward of Rs . 50,000 from the government .
The joyous thing is that in comparison to the last year the selling of GNFC has increased by 27 percent .
Brothers and sisters , in our economy , in our economy the hole of our life system is very big .
We know that these coolies are given in the form of coolie , money , jeep river everyday .
But now the rivers are engraved .
The money is straight in Bangkok .
My beloved people of my country , I want to give their advice to the people by talking in my mind every month , I want to tell their opinions .
That is why in the advice of coming in thousands of numbers of MyGov and Nrandra Modi Yap 80,90 percent advice has come to fight against black money .
It is said that the third part of the same part was that they had not only known their Madhuban but also moved ahead with this fight .
Like water , blackness should not be completely destroyed , for this one has to give more difficult steps , even behind me , how much strength they have written .
I am ignoring the people of the country given me massage by coming to the north .
Mr. Gurumani Keval MyGov says, "These churches taken to tie the blood are praiseworthy.
We are suffering from many problems , but we all are fighting against water . It is happy for us to help us in this fight .
We're working as a military team against black money, water, etc.'
But when there is so much difficulty , when so many problems are faced then man is true .
Whatever problem you have , I have also suffered .
But for an excellent meditation , for meditating an excellent thought , cleanliness work is being done , these difficulties , pains , pains also the people of the country stand with courage .
These people are real changes .
People are the blessings of God and their blessings are the blessings of God .
I would like to thank the people of the country for participating in this great memorial on water, black money.
If the person is institution , then the beauty of Rajiki bird sanctuary has to be taken pride , chatti .
Why do the rules of repeated times change
This government is for people .
The other side , I told the first day , 8th Tarikhun . This fight is not normal .
When I decided to fight with such powers , they also discover new ways to ship the government .
When we choose such new ways then we also have to put a good alternative to face them .
I want to know the heartbeats of my beloved people of my country .
Can you tell that secret
The secret is that the descriptions of Naka are coming to the people .
How much information is available by the government system , many times more information is available from the common people .
This victory available to us is possible because of normal people being alright .
Can anyone imagine how brave Pauri is taking the courage to remove such powers from my country
That is why maximum victory is available by the information coming .
Government is built to fight with all such illusions .
Its support is very easy to fight .
The archaeological category of the third type is in very large number .
We've taken it out, we've brought "Benamy Wealth Chapter", squeezing so much.
During the days of coming that chatti also does its work .
We have to do Hinduism , January literature of the country , we will give its first priority .
My beloved people of my country, Christian times I had also said in my mind that even in the midst of these difficulties our rails had made a record more difficult and descended down and downstairs.
This is a signal from the point of view of agriculture .
This country is coolie , this country has created a new lap of all these youths of this country , this country .
In the last few days on the economic platform of the world , India has kept its name in many ways .
It is the result of continuous efforts for the people of our country to see the place of India in the middle of the world through various suggestions .
Indias ranking has increased in the World Banks Doing Business Report.
According to the World Investment Report coming from UNCTAD India reached the third place of the country in 2016 - 118 countries developing economically .

The government had brought this chatti according to the emotional emotions of Irajya .
Initially the category of Divyas was 7 types .
But now it has been changed into 21 types and another 14 new classes have been brought into it .
By getting it one gets the opportunity of judgment , opportunity for many new descriptions .

In the last month, we celebrated Deepawali with joy.
This year also, as per the year, I visited the Chinese borders to celebrate Deepawali with the soldiers.
Deepawali is celebrated in the Himalayan summit with the ITBP jawans and soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Besides, it is also a wonderful step to share the soldiers in the festival while congratulating the people of the country.
Some of them suggested that a coffee table book should be made by selecting them.
We are always engaged in national security.
However, the festival is remembered at the time of the festival.
The truth is that this time it has not happened.
I didn't seem to have been at home on the day of the festival.
Deepawali is being celebrated with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, can this Diwali, this atmosphere and this feeling be reflected in the midst of our soldiers
Sometime back, a large number of villagers from Jammu and Kashmir came to meet me.
He belonged to the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
He came from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
I had the opportunity to talk to them for a long time.
The President of Kashmir, who came here from the Valley of Kashmir, gave me his word, not to fail.
If the students of the Board exams are present in such large numbers, it is a sign that our children in Jammu and Kashmir will be able to contribute towards the future of their brightness and enhanced development through education.
Congratulating the students displaying this enthusiasm, I heartily congratulate their parents, their family members, teachers and all the rural teachers.
This time all the beloved brothers and sisters of Mann Ki Baat have shared their best wishes for peoples welfare.
500-1000 will be further discussed in detail.
I am speaking to the people of the country at 8 pm on November 8th and launching a grand scheme to transform the country.
While taking this decision and putting it before you, I have explicitly told all of you that this decision is not common and difficult.
I also said that this decision will take 50 days to get out of its impact, so that we cannot move towards normalcy.
Efforts to get out of those problems that we have been facing in the last 70 years cannot be made easy.
I can fully understand your problems.
500-1000, on the other hand, such a large country, such a huge currency, and this decision, the world is celebrating well all these, and every economicist is analyzing it deeply.
Our country will end this problem with all possible efforts.
Over the lakhs and lakhs of employees, lakhs of post offices and over lakhs of bank friends are engaged in this work day and night at the centre, state governments, local bodies and government agencies across the country.
All the distressed ones are quietly considering this as a nation-service yagna and performing a great transformation.
This has clearly shown that India will take this position to greater heights.
In the midst of all these difficulties, I have seen the banks and the postal staff working.
Real power is guessed only when exams are examined.
But the evil path has become so strong that there is no habit of evil.
Even so, some people are seeing that undisclosed money, cash, money and private money can be brought into the system by any means.
Several organizations are looking for hostile ways in their efforts to save their own unethical wealth.
My name is Ashis Pare .
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village of Tirli Tehsil district of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.

It is a matter of great joy and pride for me to see the wonderful capability of the common man.
The people are going there and eating food.
But I dont know that marriages are also being done through tea-drinking practices.
In this way, people are looking for their own ways.
We can also remember this change.
See what kind of changes are happening in the villages also .
This propaganda has immensely benefitted some individuals.
During the days of coming the country also benefits .
You are well aware of the fact that the poor people were always used to paying their dues 2-3 days back.
The big men with very big hands are the ones who switch dubbed at Dhima, who asked for it so that they were very well-being.
Only 50 percent of the taxes would be paid to every City Bodies at the lowest cost.

Several such examples have been made available to the City Administrations to enable them to directly avail various benefits.
Our villages and farmers are the cornerstone of our country's economy.
Railways are looking for pathways in the midst of a lot of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions to give priority to the farmers and the villages.
Small businesses in our country are employed and economic activity is also carried forward.
Like the big malls, the small shops in the villages can do their business for 24 hours and we have taken a crucial decision on preventing any law because, according to my opinion, when the big malls are traded for 24 hours, why the small shopkeepers in the villages should not get the same opportunity
Through the Mudra Yojana, we have undertaken several initiatives to provide loans to them.
Lakhs and crores of rupees have been disbursed to small traders through the Mudra Yojana as this small business is being done by the people in the form of crores.
This is the opportunity that all of you, our small business brothers and sisters, want to ask for a digital world.
You should also download banking applications in your mobile phones.
I am confident that you will be able to trade in the entire village on the basis of this technology.
Therefore, I specially want all the labourers to participate in this system because for the last mile, I have taken such a big decision for the poor people of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the underprivileged and for the poor.
I would like to especially talk to young friends.
We are aware that there will not be a possibility of an hundred milk and a free society.
You know how many opportunities are there for a cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Each bank shall have an online availability.
Every bank has a voluntary volume.
Varieties of cards are also available.
Cards are available to crores of poor families in India under the Jan Dhan Yojana.
Earlier on 8th, RuPay card usage was very low and now the poor are getting RuPay cards.
As prepaid cards are available in mobile phones, prepaid cards will also be available in the bank.
This will be easy when you send WhatsApp messages.
Persons not reading can also be wattled, sent messages and forwarded today.
Besides, technology is so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this work.
City will also be replaced by phones with small ordinary amenities.
I am very well aware that you are participating in this grand programme.
But my dear young friends, I need your help in this work.
Technologies will be available to use online access to your mobile phones.
Moreover, every hour and every two hours, how to use technology, how to download the bank's yps and how to spend the money in your account
The shopkeepers should also be trained on how to trade through technology.
You should work as a jurisdiction for the unethical activity in the country, for the welfare of the people, for the welfare of the people, and for the welfare of the people, for the welfare of the people, for the welfare of the people, and for the welfare of the people.
You will be able to get the blessings of the poor once they learn to use the RuPay card.
We will be a modern India in the world within a month.
You will not be able to do this through mobile phones but you can do this thing by going to ten houses daily.
We have taken forward this war to liberate the country from unethicipation and to liberate the lives of the people.
There are many countries in the world that have brought about new changes in the world's life and brings about change in the youth.
We will understand the extent to which this malnutrition will take place.

I came from a military family.

Nature can be a vision, or a peaceful co-existence, or it can be an enemy, or it can be an inspiration for the youngsters to take them back to the mainstream of their lives. Our soldiers are filling the imagination of the country in serving the country.

I was freed from every state and spent about two and a half hours for each state.
I have listened to what every state has said.
Normally, such discussions have been made by the Central Government in terms of the amount of money that has been sanctioned by the Central Government in terms of states and the amount of money spent by every state will not be beyond that.
In this way, it was surprising to note that some States have made commendable efforts to address water, environment and illiteracy, and to take care of the suffering human beings.
I gave them orders to exercise righteousness Ayog in order to put in place the best practices across the States.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have fully utilised technology.

My dear.
When an e-mail came in the site, my vision moved towards it.
Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh had put his time before me.
It feels a burden on my mind and he has written it.
Earlier you people used to think that further development can be achieved.
I would like you all to acknowledge the results of your children's tests when you bring them home.
Encourage them to further develop, otherwise, they have brought an hundred to hundred - hundred hundred, yes.
It will be better if something is done on that day too.
My surroundings do not recognize our conditions.

Finally , in the last two years due to the ill effect of ill effects of ill effects on the reservoirs of water .

Other than captivity fruits , vegetables are being used as less water as possible .
He was accompanied by various programmes such as sprinklers, tiny farming, water horticulture, water recharging, etc.
I can talk about a small town like Hive Rebazar but there are many more such villages.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the villagers for their good work.
Who told me, Gorawa Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh
Approximately 27 ponds have been constructed.
Approximately 20 of their turnover has increased.
When the water level rises, the water efficiency also changes.
Clean drinking water is also a cause for GDP growth.
But how new methods are being evolved to solve the kinds of efforts that people are making around us to face unconsciousness.
Why shouldn't we take the soil out of the pond and put it in the field
The field also grows well and the strength to accumulate water for the field also increases.

Several steps have been taken for the betterment of the villages and for the betterment of the villages and for the betterment of the people.

Economic scientists in our country have also thought differently about this.

I am told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand this time from the start of the Chardham Yatra.
For the first time since the terrible disaster in 2013, pilgrims have reached here in such record numbers.

On the other hand , in the youth of India I am going to grow so much that I am going to grow so much that English Premiere Leg or Leg , or Indian Super Leg Match .
Indian youth are giving time to know fresh information about these matches or to watch them on television.
I have said that when this sports is increasing so much that when we get the opportunity to give the opportunity to the Afff-17 World Complex then we will fulfil our responsibility only by playing an economic role .
Or, should we encourage sports by using this opportunity to benefit us
Football, football, football, football, this year we should create a changing environment in schools and arts.

In scientific method this attempt is not celebrated but the work is done .
But if we want to strengthen the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world.

There is some deficiency in it , less information that you can also make me fierce .
Rain waits for rains .
But if there is no water then all our country residents of our country are also a matter of thinking .
During this time we stop flowing water in our ponds, in our ponds, in our ponds, by reaching the ponds, by reaching the ponds, or by constructing an infectious injury, the water flow stops there, hence the water accumulation becomes decreasing.
The cost of water in the past , places , other places we can prepare the ready to stand by cleaning the garbage by cleaning the garbage .
Full of ponds , if our rivers , canals are filled then after that there is no deficiency of rain water which does not cause much harm to us .
But it is possible if we swallow the pinch of every rain water by swallowing it .
This time five lakh water is contacted to digest water .
Although how much more attempt is needed in this direction .
Beloved my beloved Ratu , brotherhood , brotherhood . Italy Government of India has organised a heavy rate .
Everybody should be in balance .
That is why the expensive expenses remain less .
Our citation is: Decreasing deficit to higher-investment and higher returns.
This is the very mantra that we should take care of the scientific methods in our agriculture.
This year, the entire world has organised a programme called Beat Diabetes.
It is said that in our country approximately six and a half crore people of diabetes are patients of diabetes .
Three percent deaths occur because of diabetes .
There are two types of type . , type-2 in diabetes .
Type-1 dynasty comes .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes.

The disease of tuberculosis i . . nearby people also recognize .
In our country there are 13 thousand 500 people above microscope centres . 4 lakh dot services are available .
This test is also done free .
Get your check up done once .
This disease stops .
Getting the right treatment done , getting the treatment done till the disease is completely cured .
There are some main contributions in the month of April . specially April 14 Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar Jayanti .
He had done the whole of the 125th Jayanti hunters .
His birth place in Mahav, his education in London, his initiation in Nagpur, his house on 26, Alipur Road in Delhi, and his ceremonies in Mumbai.
We are constantly trying to develop in these pilgrimages .
I am fortunate to visit his healthy Mahav on April 14th.
Baba Saheb has inspired us how much to change one best Pauri .
By changing a good beauty on his way we can glorify him in a great way .
In some days the infected new year starts .
It is celebrated in different forms in different states .
You can hear your mobile phone.
That's just a missed call.
Now this service started on the days of the month but 35 lakh people used it .
You should also come to November .
Staying in such a way that I am so happy .
I would like to know from you how best we can use the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017 for our benefit.
How should this program be done
The FIFA Programme provides a unique opportunity to do so.
The photographs of any magnificent place have been done in Aplo . really enjoying them .
I consider it a good signal .
Wherever there is no moisture of leg , like to bear feet there .
This contribution is considered to be special objects of Koll India .
In comparison to countries India is very backward in the tourism sector of India .
You also look like this .
I'll tell you one thing to think.
Look, you'll be happy.
I would like to share this thing with you once again in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to say the truth , I forgot its identity .
You were happy with me to spend this thing .
For the preservation of water we should take those churches with complete care .
Many other diseases of our body enter our body only in the house of our body .
You must think of this thing.
It is said that the tuberculosis of babu test is done .
It is said that T . . . has come to him .
It means that this disease is such that it can also be tested very soon .
But you do not think that this work is not the government , doctors , medicines , therefore my supplication is to the people of the country .
Therefore , you will also keep glittering in your mind .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
As much as you are in the matter of tests of your children , it is the same obstacle .
But if we change the thought of tests , perhaps we will get rid of this obstacle .
I had said so early in Mann Ki Baat that you must not send your experiences and information through the NarendraModiApp.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, students and teachers especially in Mann Ki Baat.
I know that in some days the tests start .
Everybody asks how to get the tests done .
How many times come , how much scorpions do I want to say one thing .
You decide the goal for yourself.
I kept many estimations on me while playing cricket , how much hope they were from me .
The estimation of some time was even more named .
Then said I , How important is it necessary to discover a result of this .
I decided my goals by myself , I can conduct them how good I can do for the country .
I was constantly trying to meditate those goals .
The goals of central goals are fulfilled gradually on my eyes .
Good luck.
Make your future your future .
It is my belief that these words of Sachin Ri must be used for you .
Why should we not keep our memory with us
Where we reached , how far we came .
Do not get stuck in such numbers .
One of the most important goals of life should be decided by one dream.
Therefore if you want to make a large , high dream then tests will change into a fun festival .
It is a belief of Gupta that there is a healthy mind in the body of healthy body .
In that sense, our daily routine of 365 days should be consistent with our dreams and concepts.
The special information that he has done is that you should sleep regularly , wake up early in the morning from sleep , mind .
Take the entry of the test centres , other objects to reach the centres before time .
Do not do this .
I believe that you do not do this .
Otherwise , regular symptoms in life prove to be the root cause of keeping the foundation of victory nutritious .
There is a strong foundation by regular symptoms .
Those who are not healthy , those who do not tiredness of regular moments they do the work of doing morning in the evening , how much work is done after lunch at noon .
Not only this , our daily routine also becomes unsuccessful .
Therefore we should not see anything small .
Make sure, do it.
O friends .
Sometimes I saw that in the students going to test two types of water are seen .
Who can say this thing better than I i . . Charang Champion Vishwanathan who built the sports activity of the world 's handicrafted sports activity .
He will divide his experiences with you .
Come , let us learn how to play these tests by him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
How I am ready for my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been seen that these tests are like the problems occurring before life .
Therefore if you are calm , eating nutritious food , sleeping straight , then your brain will be remembered at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute very important stores , look at the same time that you are not able to remember properly .
Vishwanathan is really an important thing .
How much concentration he sits in the international charang competitions , how much concentration you will discover .
If Arjun had heard that the bird standing on the eyes of the bird .
If you are standing on the banks of a pond then many things will be found in the water below .
Firstly if there is no cost of anything then you will see after putting a stone .
If water is washed , in which steps are also seen .
It takes 30 , 40 , 50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things .
This can be my experience , it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal is a good thing .
He said in my App - We take an opportunity to talk quietly to friends, family members every day for at least half an hour.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear the things .
Ranchi has been trying to reach out to the present conditions and to spread the message of that culture within the country and outside the world.
Such worshipped Murari Bapu Saint students have sent an important Chitka for students .
He is also a teacher , counseller , therefore there is a combination of both in his words .
If you move ahead without any tension in your test then you will definitely be successful .
The pride of success is also pride .
As a poet, I would like to convey my message and good wishes. There is no law for everybody to be a culture.
Learn to live by mixing with virus also .
Our distinguished Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, considers the "Mann Ki Baat" programme valuable.
I also thank the priest Murari Bapu for giving us a very good message .
This is a matter of how much happiness to me .
All this reproduction has come to me and I feel very good.
Now I have to say this thing that to morrow start doing yoga - it will only be wrong against you.
Very light result .
Definitely pay attention to it .
Look, maybe you can do them.
Why do all these things be done easily
Read those informations carefully . For two minutes , three minutes , five minutes go away .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question seems difficult .
Therefore the tests of my competition .
Do not bed , work without bending your energy .
And I said unto all my young friends , This is the same thing .
At the same time, keep in mind that there is a lot of potential in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You win.
Don't forget that this world is our mother's children.
Trees - Just like mountains you also have a right to stay here .
You have to take care of you , emotional emotions , meditation .
By these symptoms you will be stimulated in all the tests .
You want to do victory in every matter .
God bless you .
Seeing , how would a great scientist speak
Whatever I take half an hour to speak , that thing is said in three minutes .
This scientific science is the strength of scientists to stay in mind .
I am giving thanks to the children of the country for giving support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then fear will also be scared .
The golden future to do good is waiting for you .
Now a message from the tasty Dabas on my App - has tasted the experience of its tests.
It is said that during the tests the members of their family members keep trying to stay in a social environment , this kind of exercise is also done in their families .
Sometimes there are many things like this , do not consider the words of Boley which inspire us only to the students .
We all read in our schools about the Thamas Alva AIDS discovered by electricity bulb .
It is said that light is filling in our life also .
Srinivas Ramjan meaning who is unknown in the cost of victory as well .
You will know that no traditional education has been impressed in the past .
Raling . Hari Port Siris this day has changed the whole world .
Tests are not only one of the students , but all the family , school , teachers .
But without parents , teachers the situation of camel student is not good .
Vijay Jindal had written that they should not bear their weight on children .
Today parents are not able to say more to parents .
Do not fall in tension .
If you talk to a friend then do not ignore it .
Why do I say that , friends , today national science is the day of national science .
The scientific festival of the country is participating on 28 February 28 national science day .
February 28, 1928 - Sir C.

Therefore the country is celebrated in the form of 28 February 28 National Science .
Every generation should pay attention to the figures .

Today National Science destination has strengthened the inventions of the country .
Science , science , technology , all these should be a natural part of our development journey .
This time, the National Science Day programme is Make in India.
Science - Technology Based Inventions Sir C.
But I want to tell this thing once again to all the people of the country .
The main scientist of the last century along with adopting this research theory of ice steine theory of this research has also been recognized in physiotherapy .
It is the estimation of profiting all human species , worldwide .
In this research process the children of our country , our Medha scientists also participate in it , their participation is the joy of all of us Indians .
I would like to convey my best wishes to all those scientists.
Our scientists will continue to carry this research forward in future also .
India will also participate in the artificial functioning at the international level.
In the past one important decision has been taken . In this research laser interference interference interferenceal observational observation has been said to be conserved .
There is only two places in the world .
India is the third.
Once again I tell all the scientists , ruins .
From tomorrow onwards, my Mann Ki Baat will be heard by giving a missed call to that number.
You can also hear in your maternal language .
No. 81908- 81908.
Once November is said to be 81908 - 81908.
I also have to come to the test tomorrow .

What is known .
Tomorrow is the budget .

I salute all of you.
This is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
Once again, we will speak through Manki Baat in 2016.
India is a country full of vision.
These festivals provide an opportunity to the poorest of the poor to undertake financial activities and to facilitate their income.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for Christmas Festival, 2016 New Year.

This was stated by an old labourer, Dilip Sinha Malviya, at Bhojpura village in Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh.
In the village of Bhojpura, he has constructed 100 neighbourhoods by considering this work as a fitting work without taking any wages or physical labour.
I convey my best wishes to Dilip Sinha Malviya.
We hear so many disappointing news about our country.
This is our ability to move forward.
Therefore, it is very comfortable and comfortable to make Dilip Sinha smoothly in Mann Ki Baat.
This year also marked the occasion of Yoga Day.
The mantra of Swachhata is changing in every household.
So far, there has not been a widespread discussion in the media.
But I am confident that the media will reach such villages and there will be lights for the country.
The biggest benefit of this is that the government entrepreneurs in this power transmission system will get a lot of happiness and satisfaction.
We must strive to ensure that people have good things, right things, good practices and good practices of common man.
This is also a service programme.
But I'm telling you, don't I
Everyone will load the Narendra Modi yp down on his mobile phone and shake hands with me.
I am sharing small things in this yp.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me to say a lot of things to me through this YAP.

Tell me, how can I reach the hundred and fifty crore Indians without your help
Come, let us inspire all of us to share the common citizens, give them in common language and serve their rights.
New start-ups, innovative and diverse start-ups can be set up as an excellent initiative among our States and our youth

Startup India - Stand up India brings a big opportunity to the youth.
My young friends, the Government of India is implementing the Comprehensive Action Plan for Startup India - Stand up India on January 16.
We had a feeling that the Start-ups are limited only to the digital world and IT industry.
Imagine that.
India has immense talent at the core of the youth.
On the 16th of January, I will come to you without any hesitation and talk to you in detail.
Your suggestions and suggestions are always welcome.
The 12th of January is also the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.

Once called handicapped, or disabled - specially called a favored person - many of these things are heard.

Why not use Divyangjan in place of disabilities in our country
Whatever person they are, they are one or more organs full of divinity.
Creative work should be done to facilitate all these things - technology, technology, system, arrangements - a soft, comprehensive and comprehensive approach.

The schemes are for the common man and for the poor.
There is no method of knowing or being present.

Opening of Jan Dhan Account - Aadhaar Card - with the help of this, the worlds largest cash transfer scheme has made subsidies directly to the accounts of the beneficiaries.
I am privileged to note that the largest Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in the world has been placed in the Ginnes Book of World Records under the scheme.
The scheme is being implemented in the name of Pehel, which has been successfully used.
On the one hand, the Aadhaar card scheme, the opening of Jan Dhan accounts on the other, the listing of beneficiaries belonging to the third state and central government with Aadhaar and Account, has been followed by this tradition.
The National Rural Livelihoods Homoeopathy Scheme is being implemented in the villages.
Now approximately 40 thousand crore rupees have been transferred directly into the accounts of the beneficiaries through various schemes.

Festivals are special to us in social life.
Once the festival is useful to eliminate our wounds, it will once again give a new strength.
In our country, there have been short span of time, long strides and unprecedented years.
In particular, the devastation caused by these years in Tamil Nadu has also affected other states.
But now the seeds have changed.
We must strive to enhance our capabilities at every level.
Government, civil society, people and small and big institutions have to work together to enhance their capabilities with so much depth of scientific vision.

Because that link is of News.
There is a woman from Kanpur, Noor Jahan.
If seen in TV, she cannot read much.
But no one will think about what she is doing.
The sunshine with solar power is bringing light to the poor.
There is a war on the dark.
The crowd will take her to the lantern at dawn.
I have heard that nearly 500 households at a height will come to her cough and carry lotters.
But the whole house is light .
However, this Noor Jahan will remain busy in recharging the lanterns with that solar power throughout the day.
I also appreciate the GTV as it showcases this recurring work in Kanpur to the entire country and the entire world.
Many congratulations.

But it started well.

Abhishek himself spoke of his enthusiasm.
I also get a lot of news from my cough.
I have just said that there is a man in Mumbai who is Shailesh Bhonsle.
He said the Swachh Bharat Mission is making new entrepreneurs.
Shailash Bhosle had shown it .
Our Mudra Yojana is also aimed at this thing.
In the case of Mamta Sharma of Bhopal, she was given Rs. 40,000 from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
She is manufacturing her beds.
That's why she used to do more money and used to do very hard business.
Now she is doing her job better because of a large number of handbooks.
She was spending more on other reasons due to unemployment.
Currently, the loans provided by the Bank will provide an additional income of around Rs.
A good business for their family is gradually increasing.

I have to say more about Kerala today.
I received a lecture from St. Mary's elementary school students from Kerala- Kochi and Chittor.
Mother India has sent me a picture in the shape of India.
I wonder why they made a picture of Indias size with their timber stamps.
But after reading the writings of those people who want to give the most important symbolic message, I understand.
These girls have only made the Prime Minister aware that it is not.
He aims to transform organ donation into a profession and professionalism.
I have written to these girls that they should urge people to donate their body part in Mann Ki Baat-Baat-Baat in Manasu.
The 80-year-old Sudke Guruji from Maharashtra has always been a mission.
He said that organ donation should be encouraged.
I have received a lot of messages on this phone too.
The goddess of Delhi also sent me such message .
However, there are only 5 thousand people in this country with an hundred and twenty five crore people.
Eyes of every year will be required.
We are only reaching 25 thousand.
We are giving only one place where four eyes are needed.
Death in road accidents will result in donation of body parts.
There are many legal difficulties too.

He invited 54 African countries and societies.
Outside Africa, Africa is the largest gathering of countries.
We are the third largest population in the world in terms of these two things.
Over 25,000 African students are studying in India, including Human Resource Development, Capacity Building.
Many of those who have studied here are now the heroes of many countries in Africa.
This shows us a strong relationship.
From that point of view, this session is of great importance.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a good work.
Millions of students visited the exhibition.
People from rural areas were seen.
The great role Mahatma Gandhi played in the Africa-India relations and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on these two parts was well known to the people.
Thereafter, a number of parliamentary friends performed this task.
He worked sincerely.
In the last month, a workshop was organised in Bhopal.
The Adarsh Gram Yojana was deliberated upon by the large villages, district clusters, parliamentarians and all the central and state governments on the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Fortunately, the worst of the storms - bombs and cyclones - the bloody land of Jharkhand shows us all this.

Shri Ruvala Ganesha inaugurated the festival of jaggery jaggery on 11th March in this village.
Congratulations Shri Ruvala Gaur, who worked towards making Adarsh village self prosperous village.
My beloved brothers and sisters, how will there not be a mention of cleanliness in this Manusoon
This message was sent by a woman television from Mumbai to Savita Rai.
This time we will clean Deepawali along with our houses.
Consequently, with the Deepawali, the focus on cleanliness started on its own.
You have said that whatever we think ahead of the festival should be brought to the celebrations after the festival.
We should do this in every citizens programme.
Today, I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the media organizations in the country.
On 2nd October last year, I had the opportunity to participate in a series of sessions on India-Today Newspaper Cleanliness to mark the completion of the year of Mahatma Gandhis Swachh Bharat Mission.
The Institute conferred the Clean India Awards.
I am glad that such people like 'Won Lake One Mission' have worked for Swachh Bharat.
How many countries have been cleaned in our country.
All these have come to light and I heartily congratulate the India TV Group for this wonderful programme.
He also participated in the event, covering about 55,56 thousand schools in the States of Andhra and Telangana, covering about 51 lakh children.
Bahrang regions, railway stations, spiritual places, astrologers, parks etc. have spread the message of cleanliness in the areas.
Now these news reports will give us the strength to realize the goals of Swachh Bharat through these programmes.
This is why Smt. Samita Rai has suggested that all the people of the country are now taking this programme forward by considering it as their duty.
He added that the most clean village in Asia is the Cleanest Village.
It is heartening to note that while far away from our country, in the beautiful North-Eastern region of Meghalaya, the awardees have won in the field of rural sanitation.
My beloved countrymen, while addressing the gathering from the Red Fort on 15th August, I said that there are some things that have been burnt in the house.
When a poor person goes to smaller jobs, how much he comes to recommendations, how much money he gets from the teams, how he gets money from them, when he comes to work, when there is no work, when there is no work, there is no money.
I have never heard in the world how much a psychiatrist can understand a person in one or two minutes' interaction.
Greetings to all young friends on this occasion.
And in the following budget, I have announced a major scheme:
In our country, gold has become a part of social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in banks.
Now do not keep gold in the house .
Once again, there will be golden dust in your hands at the Savarin Gold Bond.
But now we started it .
As a result, now there is no need to buy gold.
In the week to come, this scheme that will provide a benefit to the safety, few people of the country will come forward.
I am glad to say that we are also bringing gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't our country's Swadeshi be sealed
And that is why in the coming week, we will bless the common people before we bless ourselves with the Ashoka Chakra of five grams and ten grams.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be available to the people.
I am confident that this new scheme is bringing about new changes in the economy and assisting me.
But there is a need for a united mantra - for our thinking, for dealing with the methods of individualization.
There is Vidhya Pradesh in India .
Many classes, religions, traditions, many languages, different species and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the same mantra.
Peace, harmony and unity are the divine principles of development.
In the last few years, on 31st October, the Run for Unity programme has been organised at various places in the country.
Take the mantra forward.
Now you will be busy in organising Deepawali and cleaning your houses.
New items can be bought.
Deepawali is celebrated everywhere in the country.
Greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
But on the day of Deepawali, I hear a few words.
Therefore, I say that I am particularly enthusiastic about my visit to Britain.
It is indeed a matter of studying the work done by the world for women empowerment for the democracy of Bhagwan Visvesvara so many years ago.
The discovery of the idol of Bhagwan Vishweshwar on the land of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India think far and wide.
We should learn languages in a country like India.
I will try hard for 8 hours at night to reach you in your language.
However, there has been a good bond between us.
The last year has been completed.
Now we are entering a new year.
Once again my best wishes to my beloved countrymen.
Prime Ministers Mann Ki Baat Programme (PMKBY), September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - In Mann Ki Baat - One year, many things.
I don't know what you've achieved from this but I can't tell you how much I am earning.
Peoples power has great significance in democracy.
There is an immense vision in my life and I believe in the power of the people.
Well, I learned in Mann Ki Baat, I understand, I know, I get, this is what I say that the greater the demographic dividend is immense.
Our ancestors say that people are part of the destiny.
But millions of people used to send me suggestions consciously.
This is a great strength in itself.
These objectives have taught me a big lesson.
It means that information has to reach the bottom level from the bottom to the bottom, it has to go from the bottom of the order.
Who would have said that the dawn of the news will become a talk in Mann Ki Baat.
But this has happened.
In the same way Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat - there is a need to demonstrate the strength of the society.
In keeping with the tourism sector in India, I urge all citizens, incredible India and brothers and sisters that you will also visit and send a good photograph.
But how big a problem has come.
Photos were sent from all over the country for lakhs of rupees.
A vision for peoples power and a feeling.
Once I had spoken in Mann Ki Baat Manas, there was a fire in the houses of the poor, and children were crying.
It is a difficult task for the common man, middle class and the lower middle class to get rid of the subsidy.
From Siachen, but from Kutch, there is nothing that cannot be phoned from Cameroop, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
Fond has been done from all the places .
It is a pleasant feeling.
He sent his message to all the age groups.
I like to hear some messages myself, it is very good.
My team is working on them all.
But the reason for this is that they listen to the radio because they cannot watch TV.
I have come to know how important the radio is for the visually impaired
I am seeing another new angle, how good things they have told me - there is enough to conscious the government.
Pawan Acharya message was sent from Alwar in Rajasthan.
Soil prices are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on the sacred dawn.
Our Army, Naval Command, Air Force, Air Force, Navy that protects the territory of the country, the sea and the skies.
In 1965, 50 years of war with Pakistan were completed.
In this regard, he organised an India Gate Exhibition at Delhi.
I have seen it very keenly.
Fighting in Hajipur, however, has taken place in Gony and Summit, but Hajipur passes through the winners of the victory.
The history will be associated with our legacy.
I would like to see you and your families - if you are around Delhi then this exhibition will last a few more days.
Don't look like this quickly.
I returned in two and a half hours.
A young boy ordered the Prime Minister, but the boy forgot to mention his name very soon.
For the first time since independence, the Parliament has been discussing the issue of cleanliness for hours.
I am seeing good in it .
It also looks at the country's parliament to deliberate on cleanliness.
On the one hand, Parliamentarians and on the other hand, both are talking about cleanliness.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi says.
Once he said that he has to choose between freedom and cleanliness, he chooses cleanliness and freedom.
Cleanliness is more important than independence for Gandhiji.
He said that he wants to know about Deendayal ji's centenary.
2nd October, the birth anniversary of the revered Bapuji, Mahatma Gandhi.
5 per bbl on account of any fifteen, fifty rupees or any fifteen rupees.
It gives you a little bit of joy too.
Subhash Chandra Bose's family members visited Kolkata in May.
He laid the foundation stone of Chandra Bose, son of brother.
Subhash Babu was happy and enthusiastic with his family members.
Chandra Bose and his family members were present on the occasion and over 50 members of the Subhash Bose family came to the Prime Ministers residence last week.
But moreover, it is a matter of joy that the opportunity to host such a great man will never come to the Prime Minister's residence, which I am getting in October.
This is why more than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu, who live in different countries, are specially coming here.
Is it something that gives me pleasure
The precious power I have got is safe.
In the meantime, I visited Kashi.
I met a lot of people.
One of the students of Kshitij Pandey was also present on the occasion.
Banaras is reading at some point in the central university of Hindu University.
But at such a young age, I had a taste of physics.
I have seen his belief and interests in what he has said.
I hope that scientific temper of all the children of the country will grow.
Sometimes it also enjoys something like this.
Sometimes our aerospace accomplishments - half an hour.
But I will support your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
It is still very smooth for a month.
Mann Ki Baat Programme has been completed a year and you are aware of it.
You know how much Subhash Babu uses radio.
He spoke of Azad Hind Radio, with a Weekly News Bulletin.
He was conducting radio in all languages English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pass and Urdu.
I have also started this year while talking to us in Akashwani.
My son-in-law, in my mind, the word has become meaningful, in your mind.
I am, but those things will be yours.
Your suggestions must be given.
The Government will also benefit from your suggestions.
There is a lot of trouble.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2015
On the second time I got the opportunity to come between you to tell things in my mind .
In the far south, people are drowned in Onam Sabaras and celebrate the holy Raksha Bandhan across the country.
The Government of India has entered many new myths for common people .
11 crore households have been covered under this scheme since its inception.
On the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all mothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking to you about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana at a bigger level than a year ago.
Youth objects are also found . In one year Bangking Rang , economy , lice .
Don't stop opening accounts.
We have benefited the poor by getting doubles from the bank.
These banks are yours and you must not leave them now.
I have brought these to you and it is your duty to buy them now.
Our bank accounts should be sustainable.
I am sure you will ceaselessly.
Incidents and violent incidents of Gujarat have brought the entire country to a standstill.
Whatever happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel, it will hurt the entire country the very first.
But in a short span of time, the elders and my brothers and sisters of Gujarat had improved the situation.
He played a key role in the elimination of the situation without uncertainty.
Peace, unity and harmony are the way forward.
On the contrary, the sympathy and the composition of the soufa tradition is inherent in the composition of music.
All this has made me feel like being among them.
I believe that there is a need to inform the entire world about the true nature of this soul in a proper manner.
I am confident that the love and liberty of the Sufi tradition will bring this message to far-flung areas.
I am also telling others that there is a need to understand the Sufi tradition in any way we follow.
I am fortunate that I will get more opportunity in a hurry and I am fortunate to receive this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world are coming to Bodhgaya in India.
It gives me great pleasure to invite me in the presence of Buddha.
The first Prime Minister of our country, Pandit Nehru, went to Buddha.
I have already proposed this in Mann Ki Baat programme.
We have issued an Ordinance on landscape.
The Ordinance will be terminated on 31st August, 2019.
But there was a deep in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, I said that it is not merely a business ministry but now it will be made a farmer and a farmer welfare department. We took this decision very fast.
There is no need to identify your fears.
Since the introduction of 1965 war, it is common to recall Lal Bahadur as a scientifician.
The mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is also a reminder of it.
It is unanimous to recall the immortality recipients of Indias Triple Talaq and its pride.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Last week, I had the pleasure of getting the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi community.
I have had the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the laboratory to the region
It needs to be taken forward as a necessity.
Whatever dreams they have in their eyes, what I have said in the following Mansu programme: Students should move towards Vijna Shastri, there is a lot of chance, and there is a lot of opportunities.
Especially tell my young friends one thing.
Everybody is running . They can also be the reason behind water .
The decision to free small enterprises from intervals will now be approximately implemented.
This was the first time that this meeting was held in the country outside the United States.
Currently, nearly 50 thousand pregnancies per year, 13 lakh children die at the time of delivery or even after delivery.
As we get rid of polio, we have got rid of tetanus on maternal and child mortality.
News about dengue is coming up between the two countries.
We should not make death so easy.
How much of life has been priceless .
Not paying attention to drinking water and hygiene are the causes of death - that cannot be correct.
Free Dengue Assessment Tests are available in 514 Centres across the country.
Now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country, but we will get the opportunity to live for the country.
Both the leaders enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes, due to lack of awareness, we commit injustice to our youth.
I don't know anything new, I think this is going to be centuries old.
My experience with the youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth - there is a lot to learn from them.
They say Sande on Cycle has been used.
Some say that we are playing a cycle day in a week.
Man Kibit , June 2019 .
Namascus , my beloved country .
Sometimes our words were inspiring us .
How can you imagine my time in this middle .
On Sunday , last Sunday , the last Sunday at 11 o'clock I felt as if I had lost something or the other .
Sure it looks.
Perhaps it's not a permanent program.
In this program there was life , it seemed that the mind was available , the heart was available , hence in the middle of this program I felt very difficult .
But this Sunday has waited a lot.
He said that in the last few months, many messages have come and people are also missing Mann Ki Baat.
It will be very good for me when I read them , when I heard them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances
I can fulfil your curiosity .
I also feel like paying attention to those emotions .
But if they talk then the form of 'Mann Ki Baat' changes.
I was Baaldera before the end of the polio in the hustle-bustle of Jaypajayas .
Many people were discovered in which the meaning of Rajiki was discovered .
This is my dear , I have the chance to spend with me .
Everything can be said just one thing that I had got the opportunity to fill that solitary cave in Kedar valley due to a small break in the line of Mann Ki Baat.
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
Whenever I am not able to say , but definitely do .
Because you have that right on me .
In the matter of Kedar how people were curious about curiosity , with curiosity some positive things have been kept in mind , many times in your words .
Sometimes the work of paying attention to my thoughts also keep talking to you .
People , country , society , problems related to society , challenges also keep on telling them along with bringing them in my sight .
If someone writes about cleanliness , polluted pollutions try to make their wrath clean as well .
That is , the results of a kind of problems are seen in your words in the society of society .
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the society.
The internal strength , strength , talent of the country is not defined by this.
It is essential that those strengths and talents be coordinated and given an opportunity.
Through this Mann Ki Baat, one more thing is that 130 crore people want to participate actively and efficiently in the development of the country.
You can imagine how much energy I get when I do analysis of such things.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, you sat down, you gave me a chance to speak again.
With this feeling, we take the tradition of Mann Ki Baat forward.
There was a climb in the mind of all people .
Therefore the country has given invitation to how many acquaintances for the protection of democracy besides its own profit .
Probably in any country of the world , without holding their remaining rights , powers , needs , not only for democracy but also for democracy this country has seen such a number of 77 -LRB- seventy seven -RRB- .
Democracy has been a part of our country today, with so many gatherings, from riches to poor people, to participate in this festival with joy and joy, and to decide the future of our country.
Anything we'll underestimate when we have, we'll also ignore its amaging facts.
This number may seem normal to us but if we see in the world then more than a single population of any country of the rest of the world has been defeated today.
But how many people were voted in the number of the members of 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the total population of Europe .
It introduces the enlargement of our democracy.
The number of civilizations in 2019 is the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a situation you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are needed .
It is possible only if lacs of teachers , rulers , workers , workers work day and night .
About three lakh Paramilitary teams have taken up their responsibilities to enable this great yagna of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel of various states have also worked at the grassroots level.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done .
Over 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines and over 17 lakh VVPAT machines can be imagined in such a big way.
It has been done that no one Ooty should not come to the unforgettable situation of using its Ooty .
A polling station has been set up for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the world 's highest place is in India .
This is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
Not only this , in these so many more prides are also there .
Probably for the first time in history women also participate in Ooting with equal enthusiasm with men .
The quantity of women , men is about equal in these numbers .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that today 78 women are employed in parlor today .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of times saying, Not Book.
Our prayer is to give books instead of flowers in welcome .
Approximately at many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, I gave a book "Prem Chand Ki Lok Prem Kahania".
It gave me a lot .
I did n't get much time , during delivery I got the opportunity to read some stories again .
In their stories the heart of the whole of India reflects.
When I read the story of 'Nasa' written by him, I turned to the economic imbalances of the society.
When I was young I remembered how many nights were spent in the churches on this matter .
This is the story of Ishwari, the son of a Jamindar, and the Veer of a poor family, if not cautious, whenever the effect of evil coexistence takes place, we know that it is not known.
The second story that binds my heart is Id Gah, a child's heart beat, his love for his brother and sister, his maternal uncle at that young age.
Taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to go to my mother , really it is said to be the grief of human heart .
The last lines of this story are not so emotional , the small Hamid is playing Hamid Park - Old Amina , Amina has become a small sin .
Pus Ki Rat is a miraculous story.
In this story a poor painting is seen .
He feels that Haldu Ritu has not been destroyed so much that in winters it is not necessary to sleep nights like field in winters .
In reality this stories are old for a century , today it seems sufficient to be sufficient .
After reading these I had a special experience .
If we talk about reading , in some media I read about Akshay Library of Kerala .
If this library is in a village of dense forests then you will not be surprised .
The first school teacher there is P . .
K.
Both of these small children have been polluted for this Library .
Once the books were also brought by carrying on the shoulders .
Today this Library is watching everybody along with the children of tribals .
Gujarat -LRB- not only Gujarat -RRB- is a successful use of Gujarat .
In lacs of numbers all age groups participate in this garden only .
All the listeners of the book Mann Ki Baat will be able to know about it in the NarendraModi App.
I am very happy that my beloved countrymen, apart from the present people of our country think about the future of cooling ahead .
I noticed while reading your explanations in the NarendraModi App, MyWorld, a lot of people are writing about the problem of water.
Pavan Gaurai in Belgaum , Sitashu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar , Yash Sharma , Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems .
There is a lot of importance of water in our culture .
It has been said about the water of opposite in the Rigveda that Apollo is the meaning of life force , energy , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , excitement , excitement of life .
Every year the problem of water is lifting up in many places of the country .
In the rainy season along with the year we can hide only 8  water in the water of rains that you will not be surprised .
Only 8 .
The time to discover this problem has to be discovered .
The rest of the problems like the participation of the people , with the power of reproductive power , with the capacity of hundred crore people of the country , with the help of contribution , this problem is also solved .
A new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country, especially considering the importance of water.
By this decisions can be taken fast in all matters related to water .
Some people did a new work .
Sirpanch of the country has written northern tips of all the villages of the country .
For making a collection of water for the villagers , to collect water , to collect rain water every drop of rain water in the village a collection has been made in the village council , to discuss with the villagers .
In this work participating in the whole week with full enthusiasm this month 22 thousand people had done tribute in Panchayatti .
People in the villages have made an attempt to make every drop of water .
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I will share a surprising message with you.
The Lupung Panchayati Sirpanch of Katam Sandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand gives us a message and my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were ready to play their role for water conservation once again .
All the princes of the village , all the serpents have many feelings for their activity .
The people of the village seem to be competitioning to build their village , their villages .
I have seen positive consequences of adventurous attempts before .
There is no alternative for the result of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore efforts are being made in various areas of the country , in various ways .
This will prevent the problem of water logging.
A major change came from the small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
20,000 women joined hands to revive Naga river in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that in Garhwal too, all women are working very hard on rain water harvesting.
I believe that such attempts are being made very strong that if we try to make the impossible possible as well .
My first request - how the people of the country have demonstrated hygiene and for water conservation.
I believe that water is the Prasad of Parmeshwara.
To save one drop of water one drop of water is a necessity .
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
I would especially urge the leaders of various regions to work towards innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Leave films , but let our friends of media , but let the people of social institutions , but let the people of cultural heritage , but let the prophets of everybody take care of their own way .
Wake up the society , do the society together , work with society .
Look , we definitely see changes before our eyes .
I would like to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you have the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Pujya Bapu, there is an house behind the house of Pujya Bapu where there is a water storage tank of 200 years.
Therefore I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Temple then definitely see that water tank .
Come , let us make maximum methods related to water conservation inspire people for water conservation .

Mon Ki Baat, February 2019
If the mind starts coming to Italy then mind is heavy .
For ten days Christian Mother Bharat had lost her sons .
These mighty men lose their life for the protection of 125 crore people of the country .
For sleeping peacefully the people of the country these virgins saved us from their sleeping .
Our armies are always showcasing unparalleled courage and might.
The feelings expressed by Ram Niranjan, the father of Ratan Thakur, the martyr of Bagalpur in Bihar, in such tragic moments also inspire us all.
It is said that he will also send his second son to fight with enemies , if necessary he will also fight .
The wife of Amarvir Prasanna Saheb 's wife of Jagsingpur of Orissa worshipped her .
These small psychological psychological psychological disorders of India tell us everything .
We get to see such emotions , our virtue , marvellous houses .
There is no mineral in it for their families also .
The Amarkund of Deoria is the family of Vijayya Maurya family , the parents of Tilk Raja of Kangra , the son of Amarvir of Kota , the son of sixteenth son of Hemraj , who is full of inspiration of every family of these martyrs .
These families have to try to understand the emotions exhibited , to understand that I am making ourselves to the youth .
The living testimony present in front of our eyes is an inspirational example of the grandeur of India .
My beloved countrymen , independence came home , all of us are waiting for the symbol of war memorial .
I was surprising , painful in India that there was no National War Memorial .
It is a memorial to preserve the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation .
I have decided to make such a memorial in the country .
It is a matter of great joy to complete this construction in a very little time we made one of the national war memorials .
To morrow i . . February 25th honey , we gave this national soldiers to the army of this national soldiers .
It is a small attempt to fulfil their curiosity .
This memorial has been built near the heart of Delhi, i. e.
It is my belief that visiting this National Soldier Memorial is like visiting a pilgrimage to the people of the country.
After coming to the independence of the country this national memorial is a symbol of thanksgiving to the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country .
This memorial shows the shape of a symbol , unique courage of our martyrs .
The National Military Memorial concept is based on four concentration circles, in the first round, the entire journey from the birth of every soldier to the sacrifice of his life has been depicted.
Jwala Amarvir is a symbol of Amarkantak .
The second circle is the bravery cycle.
There is a queue of dense trees in this wheel .
Seeing on the softness , to know about the great martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving thanks , it is important to exhibit this national soldiers coming to visit this national memorial .
To stay with our lives , to stay safe from the country , to develop our lives their lives are here .
It is not possible to say in words with great importance to give our weapons , polices , Para Military teams for the development of the country .
Last year in October I also got the fortune of dedicating this national military memorial to the country .
For the protection of all of us the thoughts of proclaiming thanksgiving thanks to the women police , and other men Police Sibbadi is the memorial of this national police .
I think that you will definitely go to see all the memorials of the National Police memorial .
Whenever you go there , do sharing the photographs taken there in social media so that others also get inspiration to go there .
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, you will find thousands of answers, businesses and opportunities for me to read through different mediums.

What is he , when the English had discovered Birsa Munda on the 3th March , 1900 , then he was only the age of his age .
Birsa Munda , Jamshed Ji Tata in Mann Ki Baat , says it is a kind of pride to remember the history of Jharkhand , heritage of Jharkhand .
These two important officers have increased not only Jharkhand but the softness of India .
Together with them Gunu Yat India is thankful to them .
It is necessary to know about any inspirational personality of the youth , which is the identity of Mahabharata Birsa .
The English had hid him , and took him while he was asleep .

The sunlight has filled the light in their life of mosquitoes , mosquitoes .
Mahabharata had sacrificed his life in the small age of the martyrs of Birsa Munda .
But from the point of view of itching the stories of the people of those areas , beauty , sacrifices have not been beautiful even today .

Since then the government had discovered him in jail as well .
In 1977 he became the prime minister when he had discovered the victory of January .

Why is it important that the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution of India (Amendment) made in the Emergency - Reducing the power of supreme Court, and other such provisions - harming the values of our democracy
Similarly , in 1975 as the democracy of the emergency was done in the future , in the future the arrangement of Morji Bhairi was done for ever .

Along with devotion , cleanliness is also done in the administration , far off places give a good thing about this .
This time after the sacred confluence of every traveller one also gets to see the pilgrimage of Akshay Tree .
Symbol of the faith of the people, this Akshay Tree remained inside the fort of hundreds of years so that devotees could not visit it.
Now the gate of Akshay tree has been opened for everyone .
When you come to the Kumbh fair , take photographs in different contexts there , share them with everyone in social meditation so that most people get inspiration to go to the Kumbh fair .
Full of spirituality this Kumbh , Indian philosophy should be a great Kumbh .
This Kumbh of the devotees should be given the important Kumbh of the world tourism .
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.

"My beloved countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held in Kevadia on the Narmada shore of Gujarat. The world's highest statue, Statue of Unity, has been a powerful church with the top police leaders of our country.
In order to increase the protection of the country , country , country and abroad such churches have been discussed in abundance on food .
In that context, I announced the launch of the Sardar Patel Awards for National Integration which will be conferred on those who have worked hard for national integration.
Sardar Patel Garden has given his youth for the entire life of the country .
It is said that India was not able to scatter the unconsciousness of the unconsciousness .
It is believed that the power of India is hidden in the diversity here .
Sardar Patel ji honored this feeling by honoring this emotional archaeological archaeological archaeological authority .

Mon Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October 2014, on the day of Vijayadashmi, the programme of Mann Ki Baat was started and all of us started a journey together through the medium of Mann Ki Baat.
The journey of Man - Ki Baat Dharawahi completes fifty bags with Italy .
That is why this is our Golden Jubuli Association , that is , the Golden Festival of Italy .
This time the phone Kals coming from all of you , Uttaranchal also proposed to identify this golden festival .
Shri Ananthkumar, Amar Kumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav from Delhi in MyGov
We asked what is the whole week , people consider you to be the latest technology , scientific technology , scientific media , mobile opposite person .
But why do you have to meet people through radio
I told you a story .
This was done in 1998 .
I am a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party while working in Himachal Pradesh.
The cost of the country is called the bomb of India .
I didn't mean "I said.
Then he said , Listen to radio , listen to radio , radio has been discussed on the same thing .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayya had come forward , told that on that day the Territory test has been done that how much this tea has been discovered in radio .
It is said that radio was estimating the power of the radio .
After becoming the prime minister it is natural to return my sight towards the most powerful medium .
Fade Bak coming in this survey is very interesting .
How expansive church has also been done about the puja positive .
This is the best example of the point of view of social , positive emotional emotional emotions situated in the minds of all our country .
Some people have also shared their experiences as well as the emotions of voluntary service i . . voluntary service in the people due to the Man Ki Baat program .
People are coming forward at a very high pace for the society.
I am very happy to change radio more favorite for people because of the program of Man Ki Baat .
The north , online trade , phone Kals , in all these the acquaintances of exhibitions are clearly visible .
Modi comes, he goes, but this country remains stable and our culture remains stable.
All these small stories of the country of 130 crores are alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , how do the highest peaks with new enthusiasm .
My experiences also participate with water .
After that slowly this thing brings a change towards a change by buying grapes , social meditation , Vatsop .
He also learnt how to set up his own households, and sometimes the Prime Minister in phone calls.
Can any government ever have the power to develop a selfiewithdaughter propaganda from a small village in Haryana and not only in the country but also abroad
Many times the monastery of Man Kibit is also identified but in my mind when all the people of 130 crore country are always there .
They all are my mind .
This is not the word of the Government of Manki Bath , but it is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational drive, a respectable India's word.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest honour of the fiftyth Man Kitt Talu is that besides one prime minister you are asking a question of a nearby man . Praswamy meaning this is the same .
If you want to give a simple answer to your question then there is nothing to be prepared.
Association is a very easy task for me .
Every time the north of the people come in front of the Man Kibit .
MyGov, people share their thoughts in Narendra Modi Mobile App, there is also a toll free number 1800117800.
People done this number record their message with their throat .
Most of the north , more expansive expansive expansive attempts to read themselves .
I listen to a lot of phone calls myself .
I will read the thoughts , instruments , instruments which you have sent during the journey .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore nobody reads anything north , the situations of northern writing , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not only a piece of Kaiti .
Actually the actual things meaning the name of the village , person etc . are mouthed .
I would like to thank all those who have participated in Mann Ki Baat, for example, Bhavodav, Excitement, Mann Ki Baat.
Not reading their north , expansive expansions , but again the number of those who send northerns , expansive numbers is in lakhs .
An attempt is also made to bring unpleasant answers and information to the concerned departments in Mann Ki Baat.
I would also like to thank all my colleagues in the field of radio, far-sightedness, the rest of the T.
Because of their tribulation Man Kibit reached most people .
All the programs of skywani Vrindra Bandhan are published in many languages .
Some people are listening to the sound of monkeys living near the throat in the province language as well .
Similarly they are changing the Nrandra Modi along with those thirty minutes .
You all also want to hear the program of Man Kibit in your language .
Everybody has also been considered to be less carving about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
But media has changed many things proposed in Man Kibit .
Cleanliness , road safety , drugs freezing , selfie with daughter etc . , the media has worked in a new way by giving a new form to the media .
If your support is not with you then the journey of this monkey was incomplete .
"Garoo, thank you so much for calling your phone.
If you want to say the truth then there is no secret with me .
We do not obstruct old things of our own life , it is easy to understand anyone before .
Sometimes our bird sanctuary makes the biggest obstruction of conferences .
Not confessing , not confessing , trying to understand anything instead of every activity is my first priority .
I am trying to talk to the youth in various programs or social meditations.
They do , think that I am trying to understand .
It is very good to question the youth .
They're specialists in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to the neighbourhood of our neighbourhood , social enterprise , startups , sports , or any other kind of changes in the society .
If the question is courageous , then adventurous to meet big dreams .
Youth thoughts are being brought to the ground, we give freedom to adopt them and they can bring about social changes in the country.
My beloved countrymen, I would like to speak about the Statehood Day tomorrow i. e.
Today it is very special , because we have emotionalized the state , today we are asking for the seventieth year .
Blessed is the blessedness of your information .
In the deficiency of three - three Mahamahals all of us gave us such an expansive , expansive state .
The sea shore built with an extraordinary speed is also an example of Time management , producing cinema .
This also gives us inspiration to fulfil our responsibilities during record .
It is the confluence of the great personalities of the country that the people of this state should not be empowered, the poor person should also be able to empower the people of the country.
About Hakullu , responsibilities our state has been described extensively in our state .
These two times take the country forward in the life of the country .
In the identity of me , in 2010 when 60 years of the kingdom of India was completed , in Gujarat we swimming on the elephant book of the state .
In the youth an attempt to encourage the state , to encourage them the estate of the state which is an attempt to make them aware of the state .
In the year 2020 we complete seventy years in the form of a Ganesha . In 2022 we come to freedom and complete seventy five feet .
My beloved country , if we talk about the Kingdom ' s council , then that corner of the kingdom standing at the centre of the council is unforgettable with Mahabharata .
Praswamyam Babasaheb is located in the Narnaras of India . Praswamy of India has not come from outside .
What is the cost of cost i . . the cost of cost .
India Fast - this is the original mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
On the second time the worshipped Babasaheb Ambedkar was worshipped .
Guru Nanak Devji was always played with the category of people .
When he saw the way of truth , Karma , service , mercy , self-confidence of the society .
In the coming year, Guru Nanak Dev Ji celebrates 550th Jayanti festival of the country in great memories, the joy of these festivals is spread all over the world.
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival with gloriousness .
Similarly 550 Jayant Festival is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train will also be run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak Ji .
When I participated in a meeting related to this, I was reminded of Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara.
Due to the earthquake coming in 2001 the Gurudwara had also been injured heavyly .
But the state government , local people refreshed the Gurudwara along with the local people gives an example of today .
The Government of India has taken a big decision to construct the Kartarpur corridor so that the visitors of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Ji located in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , let us move ahead .
Mon Ki Baat , October 2018
On 31 October 31th honeymoon we all were the favorite Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Jayanti .
On that day as soon as every year the country is ready to participate in the ' Run for Unity ' running for ICD .
Now the weather is also charming .
I express my gratitude to all of you for participating in this race for unity in large numbers.
Six and a half months prior to Independence, the world famous international journal Time Magazine on 27 January 1947 was released by Sardar Patel on the journal coverage.
In its Lead Store, this epic has given an India note.
But it is not like India to see these .
It is the fall of India divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 national institutions in the country .
The interest of the Britishers of India decreased but they wanted to go to India by pieces of India .
Time magazine has also made other stores of the life of man in his business .
How he organised the programmes in Ahmedabad in 1920, how Bardoli had guided the museum.
Sirdar Patel had discovered every problem , fulfilled the impossible task of making the country suitable .
We are naturally reminded of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel River by looking at our Bharat Mata.
Established on the Narmada river in Gujarat, this statue is double the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This is the biggest statue of Kella Amber in the world .
The highest statue of Kella in the world is in our country and every Indian is now proud .
Besides this the Sardar Patel ji drowned in the earth now increases the splendor of the sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian .
It is my belief that the people of every corner of India consider this idol as the most favorite place .
My beloved brothers and sisters, we celebrate 'infantry Day' for all the people of our country.
I salute all the part of Indian army .
I am also making the families of our soldiers adventurous for their adventurous games .
But do you know why all the people of our country celebrate this 'infantry day'
On this day our Indian soldiers saved Kashmir from the rocks on the grass of Kashmir.
This historical incident also has direct relation with Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
I once read that Taluku Old Interview of an important Indian army chief, Samnekshaw.
In that conference, Field Marshal Sam Sameenekshaw reminded the day he was Colonel.
At that time in October 1947 there were soldiers fighting in Kashmir.
In one meeting, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel reminded the soldiers of the Phild Marshal Sammanekshaw that the soldiers of Kashmir had not been able to fight in their own way.
The cost of my favorite country , playing games nobody likes .
Sport , strength , capacity , capacity - all these are important .
These are a sports activity .
These four qualities are so important for the construction of any country .
The country which has all these qualities in the youth, that country will not only develop economic, scientific and technologically but will also fly its victory in the sports activity.
These are the museums of two times .
First of all we got the opportunity to meet our parathelts in Asian Para Games 2018 done in Jakarta .
In this sports, our Para Athlets created by recording the entire 72 medals of India have enhanced the pride of India.
This has got the privilege of meeting every part of Para Athlets themselves.
Likewise, a summer in Argentina got the opportunity to meet the 2018 winners.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have displayed their talent more than ever in the Youth Colympics 2018.
In this competition, our country has won three medals in the Pathu Mix event along with thirteen medals.
This time in Asia 's cricket also our country will keep in mind all of you .
How many times in a few minutes I am more than this , see whether it is more important than that .
India is not only in Christianity but also in a way that we have never imagined new records of India.
In order to lead his life after coming out of the Anathacharya temple, he did the work of cleaning the DTC buses, like a waiter in Dhabal on the roadside of Delhi.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden plates of India .
Not only this , see the capacity to increase in India .
India has never achieved any Olympic Olympics in Judo, both in Senior Level and Junior Level.
But in the youth Olympics Tabba Devi has created history by meditation of silver .
The queen of the sixteenth century Tababi Devi resides in a village of Manipur .
If the father goeth to the hire , then the mother ' s fish was sold .
Many times there were no money for food in their house .
In such situations also the courage of Tabba Devi did not decrease at all .
The history of gaining neck for the country has created history .
Every youngster, he is the recognition of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember, we successfully organized the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
The most successful tournament is Yavat worldwide .
We have also created a new Origin in terms of the number of viewers in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakh audiences from the stadiums of different parts of the country encouraged the youth sports by seeing those football competitions .
This year, India got the fortune of hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Haki World Complex runs on the beginning of 28 November 16 December .
The Indian sports playing any kind of sports or some other game is definitely interesting Indian hockey .
Haki is a golden history of India in sports .
The midwives of Haki midwives know about Major meditation .
After that Balvindar Singh has decided a very big journey from Sinier , Leslie Claudius , Mohammad Shahid , Udham Singh .
These are giving inspiration to new wave games with our industry , games of India .
Watching the exciting competitions is a good opportunity for the games .
Going to Bhubaneswar to see the hockey matches , encourage our players .
Several people are coming forward in a clean way to organise my beloved country , social programmes and all of them are also inspiring for all the people of the country.
We can see the tradition of this heritage at every place in the society of thousands of centuries .
But in this new age , new generations are coming forward to do this work with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is ' self 4 society ' . Mywami , other country IT , electronic instruments which do not motivate their employees to do social programs , then they gave them the right opportunity to do this portal .
On seeing the enthusiasm , devotions seen throughout the week to organise this program all Indians get pride .
From IT to society, it's not me, we're not ego, it's a journey to cross the swamy.
Some children are reading , some elders are reading .
Some pay attention to cleanliness , some help the rails .
Behind all these there is no welfare . only the feeling of devotion , contribution is there only .
A young man learned the wheelchair basketball himself to help the hair of the Divyangs.
Mission mode activity means this zeal, this dedication is emotional.
Definitely he feels pride .
This feeling of 'Not me' inspires us all.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time, when I see your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting account of Shri Manish Mahaputra from Pondicherry.
Whatever happens in my guide , he said , 'Bharatti tribes traditions , customs , along with nature , tell you how important example of life in Mann Ki Baat Programme' .
Mansh Garu , this thing has been impossible for proposing you before the advertisements of Manki Baat .
This is the best opportunity to inspire us to see our glorious culture , past . Italy is being celebrated to protect environment from the world , especially the western countries .
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should look at our history , traditions once again .
Specially we should know the lifestyle of tribals . It is in our tribal culture .
Our brothers of tribal brothers worship trees , plants , fruits and goddesses .
In the middle of India especially Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region residents of Bhilwara , Ravi , Arjun trees are worshipped .
In the desert area like Rajasthan Vishnoi society has seen the way to conserve environment conservation .
Especially in the matter of conserving trees they are ready to pay attention to their life but one tree also does not harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .
The lions consider themselves dancing .
In Nagaland also the protection of tigers and forests is taken .
The pesticides of central India stop fishing at some places of the Kethen river in the bridging season .
Tribals make their houses with natural substances which, along with being strong, also do good to the environment.
The smoke residing in the solitude areas of Nilgiri Peeth in South India is made by a small pesticide found in their local items .
My beloved brother Sodarimans , tribals believe that they want to live peacefully mixed with themselves , but if anyone destroys their natural forests , they are not afraid to fight for their rights .
My beloved countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we recognise the people who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Looking small , these tasks have a very deep effect on these tasks .
For some days I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab .
A common routine working in labour is married to the son of Gurbachan Singh .
Before this marriage Gurubachan had married the marriage of the parents of the parents , but my one Sherut .
But all of you will be surprised to hear a simple night brother Gurbachan asking him that is the true strength of our society.
Shri Gurbachan Singh Jiri family has kept an example before us .
I read about Kallar Majra, another small village near Nabha in Punjab.
Why did this village of Kallar Majra came to the church , where the people there were cooked grains instead of burning them in the field , how much technological importance is required for it .
My brother Gurbachan Singh is my best .
To keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar Majra is my best option for all the people trying to clean the environment .
Your clean lifestyle is moving ahead in reality of Indian tradition .
On occurrence of drops , small precautions , small precautions , good tasks , social tasks , always play an extremely important role in making the environment .
Peace is established everywhere in life, in the heart, in me, in thee, in every particle of the world.
The 11th November of India is a special feature because the first World War on November 11 was completed.
The end of the war was completed , when the heavy destruction occurred , people were completed a century after the completion of the war .
First World War is a major incident of India .
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with the war .
Even then our soldiers fought with such virtue , how big role was played , gave more sacrifices .
On the coming of war Indian soldiers had seen the world to take anyone .
In rare places , poisonous situations also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
The only purpose behind all these is to establish peace again.
World War I saw the destruction of the world in the first world war .
According to estimates approximately one fort soldiers , other fort people lost their lives .
Therefore how important is the world .
In the last bridge the meaning of peace has changed .
These are peace , goodness meaning not only the war .
Change in the environment from acute pain , economic development has to change the social judgment of social judgment .
Nirodh is a true signal of the development of the person .
My beloved country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is supposed to be the most popular among the people here .
This award for best policy playing in this ring is similar to Oscar in that hole.
Besides, we have also won the award crossing fifty naminated rulers from twenty five countries of Sikkim.
For this I am telling many opinions of the people of Sikkim .
My favorite country , October became October .
Several changes are coming in the environment also .
Along with this the weather of festivals has also come . Dhan Terrace , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if you want to say a different kind of festivals in November month .
All these festivals of all the people of the country are many ruins of this festival .
You all want that in these festivals keep in mind your health besides your health .
For making new decisions also these festivals give opportunity .
With a mission mode you want to move ahead in your life and make a strong resolve and make these festivals an opportunity.
Your development is a special part of the development of the country .
How much developed you will progress the country as much as possible .
Your all are my many ruins .
