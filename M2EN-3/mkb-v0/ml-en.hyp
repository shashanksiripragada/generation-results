Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, greetings to you.
Today is the sacred day of Diwali.
Nowadays Diwali is being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special feature of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of the country are celebrating Diwali with joy and happiness.
It shows a micro-economic world of India.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world is an attraction for festival tourism.
In our country, every region has its own diversity and the people of other countries are particularly interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country in promoting festival tourism in India is very important.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different for this Diwali.
I had said - Come, let us all join hands to celebrate India's women power and achievements this time, that is, we should honour the Laxmi of India.
As soon as there were innumerable inspiring stories in social media.
My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took over the responsibility of five children.
Today, five of us are working well.
My blessings to your mother, Mr. Alexander.
Geetika Swami, who is acting in Tamil Nadu, says that Major Kushboo Kanwar, the daughter of Assam Rifles, is the daughter of the bus conductor, Bharatlakshmi.
Poetry Tiwari has her daughter Bharatlakshmi and her own strength.
They are proud that their daughter is a great painter.
The daughter won a good rank in the CAT exam.
Meanwhile, Megha Jain writes about an old 92-year-old who has been supplying free drinking water at Gualior Railway Station for years.
Meghaji, the humility and compassion of this Bharatlakshmi is very inspiring.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire, share the things you've got.
The emotions of that poem, the words of that poem, have been written over the seventeenth century.
How great the words, how great the emotions, how nice the thoughts are in this poem in Kannada
The pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the pinnacle of the king Jasuli-udanu i. e.
Our daughters are our pride.
It is because of the greatness of these daughters that our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, on November 12, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can never forget what I went to the Gurudwaras of Vancouver and Tehran.
I have a lot of things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it will require many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm on many evils, as untouchable.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji brought his message far and wide in the world.
He was the best traveler at that time.
He went to many places, wherever he went, his simplicity, humility and behaviour like ordinary people struck everyone's heart.
The magnificent religious journeys of Guru Nanak Devji are called Udasi .
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, south, east and west, and saw people and saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the well-known saint of Assam, Sant Shankar Dev, was inspired by him.
Buddhist-related places like Rajgir and Gaya have also been visited.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had found a solution to the problem of water.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During such a journey, Guru Nanak ji travelled to Kashmir and nearby areas of North India.
This has established a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet and the people there considered him as a Guru.
He is also a worshipper of Uzbekistan.
During his visit, he visited Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He placed a lot of hearts in the minds of millions of people, and he obeyed his advice with due respect and even today.
A few days ago, diplomatic delegates from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
There, he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which marked the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, these diplomatic delegates had the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and learn about the Sikh traditions and culture.
Thereafter, many Ambassadors shared their pictures in social media and wrote about their experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you will be remembered on October 31.
This is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India.
Sardar Patel had the surprising ability to unite people and also to emotionally accommodate people with discretion.
Sardar Patel used to look deeply and study every small thing.
He was an analysis personality in the true sense.
In addition, organisational capabilities were also excellent.
He acquired skills in planning and managing warfare.
While reading and listening about Sardar Saheb's work style, one can understand how deep his preparation was.
Thousands of delegates from across the country had come to attend the Congress General Assembly in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Patel ji was responsible for organizing all the arrangements related to the General Assembly.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
We ensured that nobody would face any problem with water.
He was associated with the farmers and asked them to make Khadi bags.
The farmers made bags and sold them to the delegates.
The delegates were not afraid of stealing shoes because they kept their shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, there was an increase in Khadi sales.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a pivotal role in the Constituent Assembly.
The Prime Minister said that it is important to ensure fundamental rights, so that there is no possibility of any kind of discrimination on caste-based basis.
Friends, we are aware that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had made a very serious attempt to unite the country's nations.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to look at everything.
After the partition of India in 1947, our neighbours' eyes fell on Lakshadweep, and they shipped it with the flag of that country.
Sardar Patel, who was attentive to this, immediately began to strive harder, without wasting time.
He directed the brothers of Arcot Ramaswamy and Arcot Lakshmanaswamy Samitiar to take them from Thiruvananthapuram to Lakshadweep and raise a tricolor flag there, and wished to fly the Tricolour flag first in Lakshadweep.
Soon there was a tri-colour flag flew, and the floor was scrutinized to look at the neighbour's dream of seizing Lakshadweep.
Sardar Patel had directed the brothers and sisters to ensure that all assistance is available for the development of Lakshadweep after this incident.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist spot .
I hope that you and all of you will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, I dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the tallest statue in the world.
For the double height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
The worlds tallest statue is the pride of every Indian.
The heights of all Indians rise with pride.
You will be happy to note that more than 26 lakh visitors have visited the Statue of Unity within a year.
The people there have started farming of dragonfruits, and I am sure it will become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can become a subject of study for the country, for all the states and for the tourism industry.
We are witness to how a place develops into a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There are people coming from the country and abroad.
Travel facilities, habitats, guides, environment friendly arrangements are being developed automatically after each other.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, It is a matter of pride for any Indian to be proud that the Time Magazine has given a great place to the Statue of Unity among the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you and yourself will take some time from your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity.
However, my request to all Indians who find time for travel should go with their families to at least 15 tourist destinations and stay at night wherever they go.
Friends, as you know, we celebrate Rashtriya Ekta Diwas every year on 31st October 2014.
On this day, we convey the message of saving the unity, integrity and security of our nation at all costs.
On 31st October every time, Terminal for Units are also being organised.
This includes people from all walks of life, from all walks of life.
This is a symbol of one nation, the Rank for Unity, which goes in the same direction and wants to achieve the same goal.
Likewise, recently, there is a special interest and enthusiasm among people about Marathon.
Phone unit is also a beautiful opportunity for that.
Running is beneficial for mind, brain and body.
Therefore, not only the body, but also the unity of the mind and the cultural India, and to take India to new heights...
So, wherever you live in any city, you can find out where the Turnover for Unit is running.
I hope that you and yourself will certainly run on 31st October for the unity and fitness of India.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel inspired the unity of the country.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to strengthen the unity and mutual understanding of the country.
Looking around us, there are several examples of constant efforts to increase mutual understanding.
But sometimes the hardships and contributions of the society get quickly eradicated from the memory.
Many kinds of people went to the ground.
All kinds of stakeholders were playing games to gain from the environment in their own way.
What kind of language did you speak to warm the atmosphere
Efforts were made to burn different voices.
We remember what some verbal architects and some artists have said to be self-reliant, and what is irresponsible.
Acknowledging the dignity of the court, the Prime Minister said that the atmosphere that warms up the society is not allowed to create an atmosphere of stress.
These things have to be remembered forever, which gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the nation.
It was a major blow to the country.
Today I pay my homage to that great soul.
My dear countrymen, if one hears a story far away from home, if one hears a story from the village, if one hears a story from the north to the south, from the east to the west, if one hears a story in every corner of India then it is about cleanliness.
It is inspired by every individual, every family and every village to have a comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort for cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
125 crore Indians are the inheritors of its outcome.
But it is also a pleasant and attractive experience.
I think I'd like to hear you again.
The world's highest battlefield, temperature is 50-60 degrees.
There's only one place for oxygen in the air.
It is an adventurous thing to stay in the midst of such a challenge in such a negative situation.
In such an opposite environment, our brave soldiers are not only breastfeeding and waiting for our borders, but also running a Swachh Siachen programme there.
We know that these Siachen icebergs are the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water to those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is an opportunity to awaken the spirit of all of us.
For Deepawali, specially for buying something new, for bringing something from the market, all this is happening in the family.
Once I asked you to try to buy local items.
If we get the necessary things in our village then there is no need to go to Taluk.
If you get to Taluk, you don't have to go to the district.
As much as we try to buy local items, Gandhiji will become a great opportunity for himself.
We have to buy something weavers have made with the hands of our weavers, weavers.
With the best wishes of Diwali, I would like to urge you to buy local items.
Look, we can see how important we can play to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes fire erupts due to carelessness .
There may be burns.
I would like you all to regulate yourself and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
No Indian would be proud of the soldiers of our armed forces.
Every Indian, every region, every caste, community or language, will always be enthusiastic to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion people of India celebrated the might of our army with pride.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers replied to our nation with the pride of being a war of terror.
Our Armed Forces Exhibitions have been organised in different parts of the country, especially in the wake of the need for more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation to know our strength.
How capable we are and how our soldiers pay their lives and save the people.
Days like Parakram Mountain remind the youth of the glorious legacy of our armed forces.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
We are sure that our armed forces will reply face to face to face to face with those who try to make peace in our country.
India has always been committed to peace and dedication.
In the twentieth century, in two world wars, more than one lakh of our soldiers made a great sacrifice for peace.
Remember that we had nothing to do with that war.
It was in the might of our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest deployments of troops in many United Nations peacekeeping forces.
For decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all air warriors and their families who are serving for the nation.
When the invaders from Pakistan launched an unprecedented attack in 1947, it was this Air Force that ensured that Indian soldiers and war equipment reach the battlefield in time to save Srinagar from the invaders.
In 1965, the Air Force responded to the enemy face-to-face.
In 1971, no one knew about Bangladesh's freedom struggle.
In 1999, the role of the Air Force was neutral in liberating Kargil from the clutches of invaders.
In Tiger Hill, the air force carried out day-to-day bombings at enemy bases and evacuated them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the commendable work done by our air warriors in the wake of the accidents, whether it is rescue operations or rescue operations.
India can proudly say that the Armed Forces contribute not only to the strength of men but also to the strength of women.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know, Abhilash Tommy is a brave hero.
He is the worlds first Indian with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he continued his journey to the ocean to attend the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the terrible maritime calamity jeopardized him.
However, this hero of the Indian Navy has been fighting the menace of the sea for several days.
He lived in the middle of the ocean without eating and drinking anything.
I didn't agree to lose life.
I spoke on telephone when I saved Abhilash from the ocean, a wonderful example of courage, determination and might.
His courage, courage, determination, determination and the power to overcome the calamity and victory will certainly inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, everyone knows the significance of October 2 for our nation.
There is another significance this year on 2nd October.
For two years from now, we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi across the world.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the entire world.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1945, he re-discussed and prepared a new edition of those thoughts.
His thoughts and ideals reflected in public domain on the rights of the farmers, the villages and the workers, and on many subjects like cleanliness and education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a peoples organiser.
It was his characteristic that connecting and connecting people with them was his nature.
This has become one of the greatest distinguishing features of his personality.
He convinced every individual that the individual is the greatest and most important person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a massive mass movement.
In the freedom struggle, people from all walks of life, all walks of life, devoted themselves to the call of Mahatma Gandhi.
In it Gandhiji says, I am giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that you're gonna get rid of your doubts, you're gonna be prideless.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, we have to think about one thing on the basis of the growing middle class in the country, the growing economic strength of the growing middle class and the growing economies of the country.
Can you remember the venerable Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something
Can you remember that spell of a noble father
Can you imagine which citizen of the country will benefit from what I buy
Whose face will be glad
Who will be directly or indirectly benefited by you buying it
I would be happier if the poorest of the poor be benefitted.
This is the Mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that a small step of yours will make a big difference in the lives of the poorest and the weakest person.
My dear countrymen, perhaps he didn't even know how Gandhiji had said that cleaning the premises would bring freedom.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Likewise, we can feel how smaller action can contribute to the economic growth of my country, economic empowerment and fighting poverty.
But I believe that if I can do it, that will be the true patriotism of today's age.
It is said Lal Bahadur Shastri used to keep Khadi's old and torn clothes because it contains somebody's hard work.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are very hard-working and each of these should be used.
This feeling of love for the nation and for the people of the country was filled with every participant of this small and short, noble man.
In a couple of days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists along with Shree Bapu.
Even as the name of Shastri ji comes, our people of India will be filled with immense respect.
His gentle personality is always a matter of pride for the people.
Besides, he may have been very humble, but he had a strong personality like mountains in him.
His illustration of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a reflection of his humble personality.
In a short period of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the jawans and farmers of the country to reach the peak of victory in reflection of his selfless penance towards the nation.
People from all walks of life across the country are associated with this shramdaan of the 15th theatre.
If you didn't even telephone on the topic that how much convenience you had after the construction of a toilet, even those who work towards cleanliness would not have noticed this much of a heart-breaking thing.
I would like to thank you very much for the phone call.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will commence on 2nd October 2018 with the commencement of the centenary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit - 'Swarajya swath'.
The Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar has enacted provisions to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on 12th October, 1993.
A few days later, the Commission is completing its 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission not only preserved human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
Our favourite leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the former Prime Minister of our country observed that humanism is not an individual imagination to us.
In this 25-year journey, this institution has created an ideal and trusted atmosphere among the people.
I think it is a matter of great hope for a healthy society and for the best democratic values.
Today, human rights commissions have been set up in 26 states along with human rights activities at the national level.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring them to work, this is the basis of SabkaSaathSabkaVikas- SabkaVikas- SabkaVikas- SabkaVikas- SabkaVishwas.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Jayaprakash Narayans birth anniversary in the month of October, we cannot remember the centenary year of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia.
These great personalities have inspired us all, they bow down to them.
On 31st October, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, which will be spoken in detail in the next Manki Baat, but for a few years, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, Run for Unity in all the small and big cities of India, in villages and in the streets, a race for unity is being organised.
Our village, streets, cities and metropolitan cities have to be organised this year.
Running for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
On 31st October, through the Regional For Unity Programme, emphasis should be laid on the efforts of all sections of the society to unite all sections of the country.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today Raksha Bandhan is being celebrated throughout the country.
My best wishes to everyone on this auspicious day.
Rakshabandhan is considered to be a symbol of mutual love and trust of brothers and sisters.
This festival is a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories that have engraved the people of two different countries and religions on the threshold of faith.
Now in a few days, the celebration of Janmashtami will be celebrated.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Shravana Purnima is celebrated on Sanskrit Day.
I appreciate all those who have been engaged in the upliftment and upliftment of this great heritage and bringing it to the common man.
We are extremely proud that Tamil Nadu is one of the oldest languages in the world and has played a major role in the propagation of Sanskrit and Knowledge since the Vedic era.
You will be pleased to know that the residents of Matur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in each other's culture.
So, in any subtle emotion or subject, it can be explained exactly.
At the same time, it is very easy to understand our soil and our traditions.
For instance, it is said to reflect the importance of the Guru in life - Ekampi lexicon Mastu guru pradeshyayethprabhayevam nasti tad-dravim, Yad-Dattavahiyanarni bhavet.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
His birth anniversary is being celebrated throughout the country as Teachers Day.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
Ladies and Gentlemen, our hardworking farmers get a new hope for the year.
Rainfall provides relief to plants and trees and dry reservoirs that bury in scorching heat.
But sometimes there is a storm and a devastating flood.
Nature is in a state where it rains more than it falls somewhere.
We have already seen that the terrible floods in Kerala are seriously affecting the lives of people.
Today, the entire country is with Kerala in this difficult situation.
We have sympathy for those who lost their loved ones.
Though the lost lives cannot be solved, I would like to assure the unhappy families that 1. 25 billion Indians stand shoulder to shoulder during this sad hour.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover at the earliest.
I am convinced that Kerala will resurrect due to the enthusiasm and indomitable courage of the people.
The damage caused by accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see how many scenes of humanity can be seen in times of danger.
Everyone, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is doing something in their own way, whether in Kerala or any other state of India, whether in the district or in the region, for the generalisation of their lives.
People of all ages have their own role in all the workforce.
Everyone ensures their role in mitigating the sufferings of the people of Kerala and sharing their grief.
We know that the Armed Forces personnel are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried to save people from floods.
My dear countrymen, this time the instructions received by Mann Ki Baat were being examined.
The subject written by more and more people from all over the country was our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Banerjee from West Bengal, Ashish Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and several others have been requested to tell about the various pictures of Atal jis life by writing the Mobile App and MyGov.
On 16th August, the country and the world were saddened by the death of Atal ji.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
In a way, he had been away from active politics for the last 10 years.
There was no place in the news, no appearance in public life.
Though the gap of 10 years is very big, but after 16th August the country and the world saw that the gap of 10 years in the minds of common people of India did not last for a minute.
The kind of love and respect that Atal ji had, the pain that spread all over the country, shows his broad personality.
India will be indebted to Atal ji for the 99th Amendment to the Constitution of 2003.
This change has made two important changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total seats.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Prevention of Deposit Act has been replaced by one third.
At the same time, clear guidelines were set to disqualify those who migrated to the party.
For years, a political culture that has been built in India by a giant cabinet has been shaped, and a large number of Cabinets have been formed not just for dividing the departments but for pleasing the political leaders.
Atal ji changed it.
His steps are awaiting money and resources.
More efficiency.
This transformation was the vision of a person like Atal ji, and our political culture and healthy habits grew.
Atalji was a perfect patriot.
It was during his tenure that the presentation of the Budget changed.
Earlier, following the traditions of the British, the Budget was presented at 5:00 p.m. because it was the time for Parliament to begin in England.
In 2001, the timing of the presentation of the Atal Ji Budget was changed from 5 pm to 11am in the morning.
Another freedom - during the reign of Atal ji, the Indian Flag Code was built and it was authorized in 2002.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Japan on Cooperation in the field of Health and Medicine.
That's a good thing. Good news for democracy.
It will be a great homage to Atal ji for a healthy democracy, for a better democracy, for enhancing good habits, and for consistent efforts to strengthen democracy and for taking the discussions openly.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I pay my homage to Atal ji for all.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded a few days ago.
You will be happy to note that the productivity and productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha is 74.
The Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and Rajya Sabha 14 Bills as a result of efforts made by all members to make the Monsoon Session more effective than the interest of the Party.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered as a memorial of social justice and nurturing of the youth.
Important Bills for Youth and Backward Communities were passed during the Conference.
For decades, the need for the formation of an OBC commission like the SC was rising.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has made this year's resolve to form the OBC Commission and has given it constitutional power.
This step will become a stepping stone towards the goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill has also been passed to ensure the rights of SCs and STs.
This law will provide for greater protection for the good of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent the perpetrators from committing crimes and will instil confidence in the Dalit Samuels.
No sort of injustice or cultured society can tolerate any kind of injustice against women power in the country.
The country is not ready to bear the perpetrators of rape.
Therefore, the Parliament passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and enacted the Strict Punishment Act.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that the person who raped an adult girl was sentenced to death by a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had completed the trial in five days and sentenced the convicts to death.
The court of Rajasthan has also taken such a quick decision.
The Act will contribute significantly in preventing crimes against women and girl children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
I would like to assure Muslim women that the entire country stands with all its might to bring justice to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the attention of crores of people is now focused on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Each day in the morning, the Indian sportsperson has won the medal in newspapers, in television, in news and in social media.
Asian games are still running.
Congratulations to all the medal winners for the country.
Our girls have a lot of medal winners for the country and this is a very positive sign.
The medal winners include youngsters of 15-16 years of age.
It is also a good sign that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages, who have achieved this success due to hard work.
I once again wish the medal winners of the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a very good show.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Good morning, Bhavnaji, I respect the child's thinking.
We all have seen the construction of rocky houses and buildings but can you imagine the construction of an excellent, comprehensive and amazing temple of a single rock almost 1200 years ago Perhaps it would be difficult to imagine
However, the Brihadeshwar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this incredible coordination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Anybody will be surprised by Rani Kee Wave, which was built in the eleventh century at Pan in Gujarat.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He is the Bharat Ratna of Dr.
M.
He is a priest in that part of the country and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and commitment.
In his memory, September 15th is commemorated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have distinguished themselves all over the world.
Now, as we commemorate Engineers Day, we should also think about the future.
We'll have workshops there.
Recently, Disaster Management has become a big thing.
The world is facing natural calamities.
What form should be structural engineering in this situation
How can we prioritise construction without waste
We have to think of many such things when we celebrate Engineering Day.
See you later.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Sometimes rain is also fascinating because of the geography and diversity of India.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
Twelve children who played football in Thailand were taken to the cave while their coach was in vain.
It takes a few hours to enter and get out of the cave.
Because they couldn't find any other way, they took shelter on a small rock inside the cave - not a day or two, 18 days.
If children see death in front of them, you can imagine what those moments are when they have to live straight to it every minute.
On the one hand they were facing the accident, on the other hand, human values were manifested together.
People all over the world were praying for the safe release of these children.
But when the good news finally came, the world was happy and peaceful.
But I think I'd like to see this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it's important to learn and understand everyone's moderate behavior.
In this endeavour, a young soldier from Thailand's Navy had to sacrifice his life.
The world is surprising that despite such a difficult situation, they have lost hope in a water-filled dark cave with so much courage and fortitude.
This shows that wonders happen when humanity unites.
The sounding of hope, faith, determination and self-confidence was special in the poems of Neeraj ji.
All the words of Neeraj ji to us Indians are very powerful and inspiring.
It must be dark.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Dr.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is Satyam.
This year, I got admission in Delhi University as a first year student.
During our school board exams, he talked about the stress and education of the exams.
The month of July and August is very important for farmers and for the youth.
Because it's called the Peak Season of Colombo.
It's time for millions of young people like the truth to leave school and go to college.
In February and March, exam papers and answers, April May is the time to play vacations, wait for results, decide the future directions in life and choose a career.
The kids come from the shade of their parents to the shade of professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy from the beginning of their career.
For the first time, you have to go out of the house and get out of the village and get out of a safe environment and make yourself self-regulated.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction to life.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be prepared to join.
I would like to tell you, calm down, enjoy life, enjoy life and enjoy the joy of the soul in life.
There's no choice but through books, learn, but there must be a habit of finding new things.
The value of old friends is huge.
Friends of childhood are insolent, but it is important to consciously concentrate on finding, creating and maintaining new friends.
Study something new, acquire new skills and learn new languages.
As far as the season is concerned, one of the poorest families in Madhya Pradesh, ASHARAM Chaudhary, was witnessing the success of surviving the difficult challenges of life.
There are so many students from such a poor family who have worked inspiringly for all of us, despite being faced with challenges, with their hard work and dedication.
Father Prince Kumar of Delhi, DDC driver and Abhay Gupta, who studied under street lights in footpath, Kolkata, and daughter of Ahmedabad's autorickshaw driver, Afreen Shaikh, deserves congratulations.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspiration.
It was an event. Once in San Jose City, known as the Technology Hub of America, I was interacting with the young Indians.
I asked them to think about how they can harness their potential for India.
I urged brain drain to be made brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji took up this challenge and made a unique effort.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji co-ordinated the Smart Gauge App using their professional skills.
This App not only connects the people of the village with the world, but also knows about any information and information on their own mobile phones.
The villagers of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, the village heads, district magistrates and CDOs have motivated people to use this app.
In a way, this App is bringing about a digital revolution in the village, recording, tracking and monitoring of all the developments in the village.
The App includes Phone Directory, News section, Events List, Health Centre and Information Centre.
This App is very beneficial for the farmers, the grammar features of the App and the factor rates among the farmers are in a way used as a market for their produce.
Looking at this event, you will find that the young man lives in America in the midst of his lifestyle, thoughts and feelings, many years ago, India would have left India, but he knew from every corner of his village, challenges and emotional linkages with his village.
But sometimes, due to lack of time, sometimes because of the distance, sometimes due to the environment, a thin layer of the spy gets covered over it, but if a small canal touches it, everything once again appears, it leads to past times.
"Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course, Purvari is a wonderful pilgrimage.
Friends, Asa Ekadashi, this time it will be celebrated on July 23.
Pamparpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days prior to Asha Ekadashi, i. e.
This journey, known as Vari, is being attended by millions of adults.
Pilgrims come to pay obeisance to Lord Vitthal, known as Vitthoba and Pandurang.
God blesses the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion.
Going to the Vitthoba temple in Pampur and its greatness, beauty and spiritual joy are a unique experience.
I have the opportunity to tell the listeners of Manki Baat that once I have the opportunity to attend the Parpur Warrior.
Innumerable sacred virtues like Gyaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram still inform the common man in Maharashtra.
This tradition of saints will continue to inspire every corner of Hindustan.
The message of harmony, love and brotherhood is received from all the relevant practices.
There is a mandate to fight society with respect to blind respect.
The world's man was a man of courage and confidence.
He had the power and wisdom to show the British rulers their faults.
The British feared him thrice in twenty years to try to commit treason.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present to you an interesting event related to Lokmanya Tilak and a statue of Lokmanya Tilak in Ahmedabad.
At that time when Ahmedabad arrived in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him a hundred years ago and during this journey Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel got the opportunity to talk to him.
Lokmanya Tilak had influenced Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel very much.
Naturally the British were unhappy with it, and the collector continued to deny it.
Sardar Saheb was a stalwart and he was determined that the statue of Lokmanya Tilak would be established even if he had to give up his position.
The statue was finally constructed and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi, not by anyone else, on February 28, 1929.
Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak.
Ganesh Festival has been celebrated with traditional respect and festivities and has become a powerful medium of social upliftment, social consciousness, dedication and equality among the people.
There was a time when there was a need to fight against the British in the country.
Out of this, our ancient heritage and our heroes in history are still interested in our younger generation.
Today you can see Ganesh Mandapam in many cities and in every streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn and develop the talent of organisation and leadership.
This time, from the statue of Ganesh ji, all the decorations should be environment friendly and in every city there should be a competition for environment friendly Ganesh Festival.
I'll bring these things to the people.
The world's Indians will be confident among the people, a slogan, a self-respecting nation is our birthright and will gain it.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our birthright and we will achieve it.
Every Indian must have good results for good governance and development.
This is the building of a New India.
On the same day, 23rd July, another son of Mother India was born 50 years after Tilak's birth.
He sacrificed his life considering that we should breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
And the youngsters like Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Mei Haidekhana Hai Jor Kitana, Baju-e-Kaat Meem Hai, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad were inspired by these lines.
Chandrashekhar Azads courage and enthusiasm for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad's life was home, yet he never bowed his head to foreign rule.
A few days ago, in the Junior Under 20 World Athletic Championships held in Finland, Indias brave woman, daughter of farmer, Hima Das, made history by winning the Gold Medal.
Another daughter, Ekta Bhain, replied to my letter saying that preparations for Asian Games are going on in Indonesia.
I am proud that the Tricolour Flag is the greatest moment in the life of any athlete and I am proud to have achieved it.
"Singleness, we're all proud of it.
The name of unity has been illuminated.
In Tunisia, World Para Athletic Grand Prix 2018 won the Gold and Venkala Medal.
I bow down to Ekta Bhawan and Yogesh Kutti and Sundar Singh for your bravery.
I wish you all a very healthy and patriotic fervour in the month of August, on several centuries-long festivals.
Let's get together again at Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was conducted in Bengaluru.
You must be aware that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Two teams performed well in the game.
Baular Rasheed Khan from Afghanistan showcased a good performance this year in the IPL.
I remember, the Afghan President Mr. Ashraf Ghani tagged me and said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am thankful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform to showcase their talent to our players.
Rashid Khan represents great players from Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done something that is a model for the entire world.
When the Indian team bought the Trophy, the Afghan team telephoned and took photographs for the first time in the international tournament.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will continue to participate in the same games with Sportsman Spirit.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, the 4th Yoga Day on 21st June has presented a unique sight.
To see the whole world become one.
Soldiers from India and China jointly performed Yoga at the high snow peak in Ladakh.
Yoga works to break all borders and unite people.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from more than 100 countries have made this occasion a great festival without any discrimination of caste, religion, region, colour and women.
It is natural for people from all over the world to participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with such zeal and enthusiasm.
It is a matter of pride for the country that 1. 25 billion people have practiced Yoga in the field of water and air of our country.
Some Veer Sainiks performed Yoga at Antarvahini and some performed Yoga at the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our Air Warriors, in the midst of the sky, performed Yoga at a height of 10,000 feet from the earth and stunned everyone.
They swim in the sky, not on the plane.
Yoga practices were conducted in schools, colleges, schools, gardens, higher buildings and sports disciplines.
Yoga has united people all over the world beyond caste, religion and regions and for centuries we have believed in the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, monks and other sacred saints have put emphasis on any subject in the form of Yoga.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, many have written to me on the MyGov-NarendraModi App to mention Dr.
That's right.
We'll only remember the doctor if we have a problem.
But this is a day of achievements of our doctors and it is a great opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of the doctor is not consistent with the treatment of the disease.
Today, the doctor has the distinction of practicing medicine and he has a great experience of how it affects our lifestyle.
With their talent and skill, Indian doctors have distinguished themselves all over the world.
Important stakeholders in the field of medicine are well-known and well-known for solving problems related to contagious treatment.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens on the occasion of Doctors' Day on 1st July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a rich history without a month or a day without any historic event.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Maghar on the 23rd.
Do you know why he went to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who died in Maghar would not have access to heaven.
And those who die in Kashi will have heaven.
Maghahar was considered inaccurate but Saint Kabir did not believe it.
They are as inspirational as in today's era.
That is , the true sacred saint knows and understands the pain of others .
The one who doesn't know the pain of others is ruthless.
At that time there was a world of suppression and conflict and he gave a message of peace and harmony.
Together the minds of the world worked to remove differences.
His words are true even after centuries.
And a Guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
He has guided millions of people, it has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught the Guru Nanak Dev community to eradicate caste differences and see the entire mankind as one and take them away.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, "Serving the poor and the needy is the service of God.
In 2019, the 55th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated.
I want all of us to participate in it with zeal and enthusiasm.
I would like to appeal to all of you that we should think about new ideas, new suggestions and new ideas about how to celebrate the 55th Prakash Parvat of Guru Nanak Dev in society and throughout the world.
There is a history related to Punjab.
This terrible event that has shamed the entire humanity at Jallianwala Bagh has been going on for centuries in 2019.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Raman Kumar from Rohini, from Delhi, has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It is the birth anniversary of Shyamprasad Mukherjee.
He has written to the people about Shyamprasad Mukherjee in this programme.
Ramanji, thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore adopted the invitation of Shyamprasad Mukherjee in 1937 and addressed the convocation of the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
It was for the first time that when the British ruled, somebody was addressing a convocation in Bengali at the University of Calcutta.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and laid a strong foundation for building a strong platform.
India's first industrial policy, which was announced in 1948, is marked by his ideas and philosophy.
He had a dream that India should be professionally self-sufficient in all spheres, skillfully and prosperous.
He wanted the SMEs to focus on handlooms, clothing and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board and All India Handloom Board and Khadi-Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950 to provide financial assistance and organizational mechanism for proper development of cottage and small scale industries.
Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that India needs defence manufacturing and defence manufacturing.
Shyamprasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity of India, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of fifty-five.
Come on.
People spoke of their vision, comfort and their achievements.
Girls in remote villages provide pension to passport services to the elderly in the village through Common Service Centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is engaged in ice-cream manufacturing industry with Sitapala.
Like the ignorant lights in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country run medicine centres along with providing medicines at affordable prices in nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was searching for jobs two or three years ago, and today one of his own industry is successful.
Moreover, ten to five people are employed.
Schoolchildren from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste management at school tinkering labs at their young age.
There are some in the society who will not be able to reconcile without telling them what is disappointing, unless they try to make distrust, unless they find ways to unite.
In such an environment, when an ordinary person comes up with an idea and enthusiasm and events happening in his life then it is not the government's credibility.
Even the story of a small child in a small village far away could be inspiring for 1. 5 billion people.
With the help of technology, while spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
A new joy and a new zeal is getting inspired to live for the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We can feel the smell of goodness.
I noticed one thing the other day, that's a very different experience.
He said schemes related to farmers have been formulated and worked successfully to increase the income of farmers.
In a way, farmers have a big role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, while at the same time, efforts are being made to ensure double profit by ensuring farmers' participation and good seeds are required to improve the crop yield.
That's why the seed bank is built.
Women're dealing with the stuff of this stuff, and they're also linked to it.
Something I know, some may not know, some may not know, some may not know, but millions of people always do some good things.
My dear countrymen, it has been a year since GST came into effect.
One Nation One Tax was people's dream, and today it's really evolved.
People from different states sit there, people from different states, people from different preference states, but the decisions taken by the GST Council so far have been taken unanimously.
There were several types of taxes in the country prior to the GST regime and only one type of tax is applicable across the country as per this arrangement.
GST is the success of honesty, it is a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, there was a complaint of Inspector Raj regarding tax in the country.
IT and Information Technology (ITT) have been replaced by inspectors in GST.
Returns to refunds are being done online through Information Technology.
GST was perhaps the largest tax reform programme in the world.
Such a massive tax reform has been carried out in India, which is being adopted by the people of the country and it is through the manpower that the success of GST can be ensured.
It was generally thought that such a massive reform would take 5-7 years for such a massive country to achieve such a huge population.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Good morning.
Navika Sagar Parikrama Yes, I would like to tell you something about them.
These six daughters of India, their team, have returned to India on 21st May, after roaming around the world on the shores of INSV for over 250 days.
The entire country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to see these daughters, listen to their journeys.
I once again congratulate the world for once again informing the world that Indian daughters are not bad at all, for enhancing the valour of the Navy and for enhancing the dignity of India.
Nobody wants adventure.
If we look at the development journey of mankind then we can see that progress has been made from the womb of any adventure.
Development is in the lap of adventure.
On May 16, five tribal children, Manisha Dhrue, Pramesh Ale, Umananda Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam embarked on the tallest peak in the world.
The children of Ashram started their training on August 2017 and were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were elected under Machine Shaurya.
They made the country proud by conquering Everest according to their name.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all those associated with Chandrapur School.
Recently, the 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian girl to climb Everest from Nepal.
My heartfelt congratulations to all those bravehearts, especially the daughters.
They tag and challenge each other.
Everyone has joined this Fit India Movement.
The film fraternity, sports persons, civilians of the country, army personnel and schoolteachers participated and heard the sound from all sides.
If we fit, India and Fit...
Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team has challenged me too, and I have taken up his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such a challenge will not only fit us but will also encourage others to be fit.
My dear countrymen, many times you have heard me talk about sportspersons and players in Mann Ki Baat.
Last time, heroes of the Commonwealth Games spoke to us on this occasion.
"Chhavi Yadavji, thank you very much for calling on the phone.
It is true that the games that were a part of the lives of all kids who were playing on every street in the past, are now declining.
These games were particularly part of the summer season.
Sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes in the night, after dinner, the children used to play quietly for hours without worry.
Outdoor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
The same game is known by different names at different places .
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It's used to play a square-board of 8:8 size, either in a blanket or a square.
This game was played in almost every state.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, Padyagi in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dyaya Gaya in Tamil Nadu and many other names like Changapo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people in every country don't know the language, huh,
We'll say we're not playing this game.
Who will be those who don't play kids and calls when they're young
Children, Koll, playing in villages and cities.
Various names have been called in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it was called Gotibilla or Karra Billa.
Gulibadi in Odisha is known as Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, season.
It's like flying the kite.
When everybody flies, when everybody plays, there is no laziness in our qualities.
The adults look serious, but when they play, they get out of their hiding child.
Traditional sports promotes our rational thinking, concentration, concentration, awareness and energisation with physical talent.
At the same time, we know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware about society and environment.
Calling people, we can build a great history of our traditional games.
The theme of Beat Plastic Pollution is Eradication of Plastic waste.
I urge all of you not to use polytechnic and low-quality plastics to understand the importance of this theme, but to reduce the adverse effects on our health, on the nature of plastic waste, on wildlife and on our lives.
Wed-india 2018, the website of World Environment Day, has a very attractive view of how many suggestions have been made, know and try to implement them in day to day life.
When it's hot, when it's over, when it's over, when there's unbearable cold, everyone starts speaking like experts, Global Warming, Climate Change.
Then you're gonna be okay with me.
These are basically climate change and the result.
Our culture did not teach us to fight nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi argued for it all his life and every step.
Today, India speaks of climate justice and has played a major role in the India-Cop21 Paris Agreement and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we move on to this
What can we do innovative
The rainy season is coming.
Preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.
The world has been re-engineering Yoga for Unity for Unity in the last few years.
Yoga always gives us the courage to wait like our father.
If all these qualities are friends of somebody, then Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fear.
I once again urge all the people to promote our heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and well-being nation.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, today is 27th May, the first memory day of the Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
My greetings to Panditji.
The memory of this month is linked to another man, the heroes.
In May 1957, Indians showed their strength to the British.
Veer Savarkar wrote without fear that it was not a rebellion in 1857, but a first struggle for freedom.
Savarkar's life was full of distinctions.
But, beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer and always emphasized the importance of harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has done a very good description of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar carried poetry and revolution together.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
If there is a zeal to do something, if there is a determination to do something then it can be successful in every situation.
It's not just about the Seeker, you can see it in every corner of India.
If you look around, you can see how people fail to confess to everything.
Still, when we go to some tea stall, when we enjoy the tea there, we must have noticed that some nearby discussions and discussions are held.
These discussions are related to politics, socialism, films, sports, sports persons, nationwide problems.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school named Asha-Ashwasan for children living in the streets and ghettos, for which this poor tea-seller spends fifty percent of his income.
He provides education, health and food to all school children.
I'm D.
Prakash Raos work and dedication are a new direction to the lives of poor children.
He's made the darkness of their lives.
You're gonna have a lot of things like this.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Come on, let's encourage goodness.
The moon will wait for a few days.
I hope that everyone will be celebrating with great enthusiasm, especially the children will get good presents on this occasion.
Eid hopes to strengthen harmony and friendship in our society.
Many good wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thanks a lot to all of you.
We'll meet again next month at Manki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April.
It was attended by 71 countries including India.
Imagine the atmosphere there when thousands of players from all over the world participate in such a big event.
Who can stay away from it in an atmosphere comprising of enthusiasm, enthusiasm, hope and determination to gain
In shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton, India has shown a record breakthrough.
India won 66 medals, including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
Everything's drowned in the same emotions.
In order to clarify that emotion, the words come to the forefront.
But I'd like to hear what I heard from the player.
It was my dream to be not a player between India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restless people who went to India this time have won medals
Manika Batra won all the medals they participated in.
She is the first Indian woman to win the gold medal for India at the Personal Table Tennis.
India won the best medal in the shooting.
Fifteen year old filmmaker Anish Bhanwala is the youngest sportsperson to win gold medal for India at the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter who won the Commonwealth Games medal for India.
This time it is also special that women are more than medal winners.
Whether it is a squash or a boxing or a weightlifting film, women wondered.
The last battle in Badminton was fought by two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehwaal and P.
Sindhu was one.
Everyone was eager to win both the medals for India despite the competition.
The sportspersons from all parts of the country went to smaller towns.
All around, their strongest friends have a role to play.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, Fit India.
Let us cooperate with Fit India and urge Fit India to lead.
I am glad that people join it with great enthusiasm.
My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming...
Fit India is about traveling and trekking for me.
It was heartening to see many renowned people inspiring our youth for Fit India in a very attractive manner.
Sanima Kalakaran Akshay Kumar has shared a video on the screen.
All of you must meet, in which he was exercising with the Wooden Beed.
He says that this exercise is beneficial for outside and muscles of stomach.
There's another video in publicity.
He's playing volleyball with people.
Very youngsters have shared their experiences related to the Fit India initiative.
I think such initiatives are very useful for all of us and for the entire country.
Another thing is to say, Yoga is the name of an expensive Fit India Movement.
Yoga has special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have been preparing for it.
The significance of the International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been recognised globally.
You're getting ready too.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your college, everywhere, everywhere, everybody in the age group, whether man or woman, should try to connect with Yoga.
Now there is no need to specifically state in India or around the world that how Yoga benefits in the overall development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You must have seen my animated video being very popular.
They've done a very minute thing to show a teacher through animation.
You'll also get the benefit.
I would like to invite you for a new job.
Many youngsters spend their time learning something new recently.
The internship, however, provides a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, avoiding papers, pens and computers provides an opportunity to experience life in a new way.
My young friends, I invite you to a special internship.
Three Ministries of the Government of India - Sports, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation - have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
If the students of college, the youth of NCC, the NSS and the Nehru Yuva Kendra Volunteers want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to join the society, if they want to become a cause for it, they can join it, if they want to become a cause for it, if they want to do something important in the society with a positive energy.
This will give a boost to cleanliness and will give a pleasure to do something before the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
The awards will be presented at the national level to the best of the participants, the best performers of colleges and the best performers of the university.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit points to those who are well-finished.
I would like to invite students, students and youngsters once again for internship and benefit from it.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Smart Internship by visiting MyGov.
I hope that our youth will come forward in this movement for cleanliness.
I am eager to know about your efforts in this regard.
Tell me what you know, tell me about the events, send photos, send video.
Use this vacation for a new experience.
I would like to appeal to the people to see that how good people are doing and what good things are happening in every corner of our country.
I saw the stories of youngsters who have gathered selflessly for the education of poor children.
A massive programme for education of street children and children living in huts in Delhi has been started by these youths.
They grabbed the condition of children begging or doing small work on the road, so that they came out for this activity.
Young people and teachers associated with this programme have been trying their best to bring about social transformation in two hours from their busy life.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are inspired by the farmers across the country.
Their collective efforts changed not only their own destiny but also the fate of the region.
Ragi, Chaulai, corn or barley are mainly cultivated in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Due to being a hilly area, the farmers were unable to get the price.
This biscuit with a large presence of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women.
These farmers formed a cooperative organisation in Munar village and started a biscuit factory there.
Looking at the bravery of the farmers, the government has linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
The biscuit is now not only in Bageshwar district but also in about 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani.
With the efforts of the farmers, the annual turnover of the crew has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs but more than 900 households have been provided employment and has also reduced exit from the district for the employment of people.
Don't we think water conservation should be a social responsibility
Imagine how to protect every rain drop.
We know that water conservation is not a new subject in the minds of Indians.
Not the subject of the book, but the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived this life for centuries.
They gave priority to water and glory.
They looked for new solutions to how each drop of water can be maintained.
In Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Pudukottai there are large inscriptions and even today many ponds are like tourist centres.
But do not forget that these big water bodies are living examples of the efforts of our ancestors.
UNESCO World Heritage Centres, known as Rani Ki Bawadi in Adalaj and Patna in Gujarat, are the centres of excellence.
These ponds are in a way water temples.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
The most remarkable fact is that it is one of the largest and most beautiful Bavadis in India, which is located in the water scarcity.
April, May, June and July are the best time for harvesting rainwater and we will be benefitted as per the preparatory measures taken by us.
In the last three years, everyone has done something in their own way on water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, about 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64,000 crore, i. e.
Over the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted by water conservation and water management.
With the help of people from about 40-45 villages, Sasur rejuvenated the Khaderi Rivers.
Whether it is animals or birds, whether it is farmer or farming or village, how blessed it is for all
We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the vision of living in a peaceful, comfortable and inclusive manner.
Please, people should discuss this topic in the Manki Baat programme to get to know about it.
His pillars were synonymous with all, and Rabindranath was a brilliant personality, a multi-faceted personality.
I was used to listening, but I don't know the language, but listening to Rabindra Sangeet in the radio early in the morning became my habit...
You and Rabindra Sangeet may have been very impressed by his poems.
I bow to Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
The entire world is celebrated with great respect and respect for the month of Ramzan.
The social aspect of fasting is that when man is hungry, he knows the hunger of others.
I feel the thirst of others when I'm thirsty.
Once a prophet asked, "What is the best thing in Islam"
The Prophet replied, Give food to a poor or a hungry person and treat everyone, whether you know or not.
People donate to those who deserve this holy month.
According to Prophet Muhammad, an individual is enriched by a sacred soul, not by wealth and wealth.
Let us take pride in being the land of Lord Buddha by showing the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, which has guided millions of people across the world.
Remembering Lord Buddha, this Buddha Purnima, reminds us of our responsibility to strive, resolve and live in the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Today, this is the highest human value in the world.
Buddhas inspiration is immense in the social vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Babasaheb asserted: My social philosophy has been established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my vision are religion, not political science.
I've got them from my guru Buddha.
Babasaheb has empowered millions of people who are suffering, exploited, deprived and restricted through the constitution.
There is no greater example of mercy than this.
This compassion of people was one of the greatest benefits of Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddhas teachings are traditionally available everywhere in Asia.
I am glad that the Government of India is associated with the revival of many Buddhist temples, including the magnificent Ananda Temple of the centuries old in Myanmar.
Today, there is an observation of conflict and human suffering throughout the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the path of compassion and compassion.
I convey my greetings and good wishes to all the people across the world who believe in the principles of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha.
I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha to take my responsibility for building a peaceful and merciful world based on his teachings for the entire world.
The people of India, spread all over the world, had a new confidence.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Pokhran, Rajasthan, on the west end of India.
Twenty years ago, it was the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias experiments have been successful and India has shown its talent in terms of science and technology.
The day has been marked as an exhibition of military power in the history of India.
Lord Buddha showed the world that the power of the soul is necessary for peace.
Likewise, you will be able to live peacefully as a nation.
In May 1998, the Nuclear Survey was conducted not only for the country but also for the country.
Indias soil is a land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India will always be able to scale new heights and goals.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan...
The journey that Atal ji started, it is a new pleasure to take it forward, we can feel a new happiness.
My dear countrymen, I'll see you again at Mann Ki Baat and I'll tell you a lot of things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the sacred day of Ramnavami.
My best wishes to everyone on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen in every minute of his life how much the power of Ramanama was in the life of a prosperous father.
On 26th January, all the dignitaries from ASEAN countries were present here, who came together with them and the cultural organisations of the countries.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, this time as usual, I have received a large number of your letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions.
I read about the online course of Sanskrit in Comal Thakur MyGov.
I am delighted to see you as an IT professional and a cultural lover.
He also informed the stakeholders about the efforts being made in this direction.
I also urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who worked with the culture to take forward the suggestion of Comalji.
I urge everybody to water the birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, your feelings have brought me to every listener.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresh ji, I would like to tell the youth about their health.
He feels that our youngsters are physically weak when they join ASEAN countries.
Shri Prashantji and the Union Government have shared these photographs on social media and Narendra Modi App.
Like it, rewrite it, bring it to the friends.
Anagha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written to me in the gratitude cards they have given behind the book 'Exam Warrior'.
I have touched my heart with so many letters, so many phone calls, comments and my reading and hearings...
Even if I talk about them, I'll have to talk for months.
He talked about the water for the birds in the summer.
There are letters from farmer brothers and sisters regarding the KISAN Melas, farming and all over the country.
Some people who are aware about water conservation have been advised.
The Festival will have letters about our festivals, our culture and our traditions.
Why don't you change these things, in these experiences, for example, such motivation, energy, spirit and the zeal to do something for the country
This is the strength to change the climate throughout the country.
When I get to know through the letter that Ahmad Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karinganj in Assam, had built 9 schools for the poor children through his will, I can see the country's unwavering will directly.
When Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary from Kanpur went to Footfall to hear the story of the poor and giving them medicines for free, there was an opportunity to understand the bonds of the people of this country.
Car driver Saidul Laskar's sister died due to lack of timely treatment 13 years ago.
After twelve years of collection of funds, the last major effort made by Saidul Laskar was apparently seen.
Because of his hard work and determination, a 30-bedded hospital has been constructed in the revival village near Kolkata.
Many such motivations introduce my country.
Today, the world's vision for India has changed.
We are moving forward among all sections and there is a belief that our country is moving forward.
This confidence, this Positivity will help in realising our resolve for a New India, it will be dreamt of.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Because of this, a lot of letters have been related to agriculture.
This time I have watched Doordarshan's DD Kisan Channel with a video of the interactions with the farmers and all the farmers should contact Doordarshan's DD Kisan Channel.
The spirit of Mahatma Gandhi was evident in his sequence of soil, farming, farming and farmers, he said, To forget how to dig the soil, is to forget ourselves.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Shastri strongly discussed the need to preserve trees, plants and tree plantations and adopt good farming practices.
Ram Manohar Lohia highlighted the need for people to wake up in large numbers to ensure better incomes for our farmers, improved irrigation facilities and also to increase the production of food items and milk.
In one of his speeches in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged farmers to use new technologies and innovations and stressed their need.
Last day, I visited the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi.
My discussions with the farmer brothers and sisters and scientists, my experiences related to agriculture, my understanding and innovations related to agriculture were a pleasant experience for me.
But the biggest impact on me was the Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This state, which is very elaborate, has done a great job.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have made record production compared to the previous five years in 2015-16.
If I explain in detail, the MSP is calculated, the wages of the work done by other labourers in a small amount, the cost of four casualties, machinery or machinery, the cost of the seed, the cost of all types of fertilizer used, the cost of irrigation, the interest paid on state land tax, the interest paid on operational capital... and the cost of the land leased... not only this, but also the cost of the underprivileged farmer or his family dependent on agriculture.
Besides, a lot of work is being done for agricultural market reforms in the country so that the farmers get a fair price for their produce.
Efforts are being made to connect the rural markets to the markets in Holsay and to the global markets.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the centenary year celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the nation celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve.
Besides, how can 1. 25 billion people shoulder to shoulder pay their best tributes to Gandhiji
I request you all to share your views with MyGov.
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, spell, or what should be the celebration
Today, the country has moved ahead with traditional methods of healthcare.
All the health related matters in the country were previously only the responsibility of the Health Ministry.
Today, all departments, ministries, Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Whether it is the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the State Governments are working together for a healthy India with a focus on affordable healthcare along with defence measures.
Disease immunity is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
The more we are aware of immunization, the more it is beneficial for the individual, the family and the society.
If life is to be healthy then first it is clean.
We all have fought together as a nation, resulting in doubling of sanitation coverage within four years, nearly 80.
Besides, extensive work is underway for setting up of Health and Wellness Centres throughout the country.
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement and it is because of the dedication of everyone to the house.
This time, IDY is only 100 days left to reach June 21st.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and around the world participated with fervor.
We have to ensure that this time also we will do Yoga ourselves and motivate the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
We must inspire children, youth and elderly citizens in new ways to practice Yoga.
Various programmes related to Yoga are being organized throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can we create a resurgence in the field of Yoga as a movement from now on till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share that video with you... so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
It's gonna help them.

My dear countrymen, April 14th Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar also spoke of the industrialization of India.
For him, industry was a good medium of providing employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we have successfully launched the Make in India initiative in the country, Dr.
In keeping with his vision, Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission are being launched in the country today to provide all facilities in big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads or water supply, be it healthcare or education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance and self-reliance.
He wanted no person to live in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that poverty cannot be eradicated only because of the spread of something for the poor.
Today, start-ups like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are giving birth to our young professionals.
He emphasized the importance of using water for the development of the country and the various River Valley Authorities and various Water Commissions are born in the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce the history of waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the importance of federalism and working together between the Centre and the States for the development of the country.
He noted that it is imperative for us to be born in a big or rich family to scale heights, but for those born in a poor family in India, to dream, to make efforts to realise those dreams and to succeed.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar also laughed at him.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes for rural development, poverty welfare and social justice throughout India.
I also urge all of you to participate in these events with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the near future, the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira, Hanuman Jayanti, Eastern Vaishakhi.
May the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir be remembered for his sacrifice and penance.

Best wishes to everyone on Mahavir Jayanti.
About the Easter, Jesus Christ's inspiring advice will be remembered, and he gave to mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice and kindness.
In April, Baisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and write something.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that the water is not coloured.
Have we ever wondered why the waters of the river or the ocean seem colored
The same question was raised in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the same question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, first of all, Bharat Ratna C.
One of his discoverys is famous by the name of Raman Effect.
It is said that he found out the truth about light skating on the same day that he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
Scientists like Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, Hargovind Khurana and Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The BOSON Party has been named after Satyendra Nath Bose.
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai and inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was a great pleasure to know about the wonders in the field of science.
Artificial Intelligence helps in the manufacture of robots, bots and other specific purpose machines.
Now machines make their minds more smart through self-laning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in making life easier for Divyang brothers and sisters in that programme on Artificial Intelligence.
Can we know more about natural calamities than through Artificial Intelligence
Can farmers help in agricultural production
Can Artificial Intelligence bring healthcare services to everybody easier and help in treating diseases in a modern way
The day before, Israeli Prime Minister was accompanied by the Prime Minister of Israel to attend the inauguration of the Eye Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
A young man was talking about developing a digital device there.
I think a lot of such things can be used by Artificial Intelligence.
Scientific Technologies Value Neutral.
Any machine works as we wish.
But what do we want to do with machines depends on us.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the light bulb, failed several times in his experiment.
Once he asked about it, he replied: "I have looked for ten thousand methods to find the bulb.
That is, Edison made his defeats even stronger.
Unfortunately, I am in Aravalli, the workplace of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised many questions for British India.
The idea of asking questions again is important for knowing the truth.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific discoveries.
Don't stay calm until you get answers to why, what, how.
On this occasion of National Science Day, I extend my greetings to scientists and all others associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all subjects such as security, accidents and security in times of crisis, people write something to me about it.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune and Shri Narendra Modi have been commanding the Mobile App on Safety at Workplace.
He writes that safety norms are not good in factories and manufacturing operations in our country.
The Prime Minister said that on 4th March, India's National Safety Day, we have to talk about security in the Mann Ki Baat programme to make people aware about safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, initiatives and preparations.
One needs safety during accident - duty disorder , the other is necessary in daily life - safety in average life .
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, if there is no such precaution, it is difficult to be in danger.
We must have often written on the guided boards: If you are not aware, the accident will certainly be harmful, the happiness and laughter will be lost and ensure safety without leaving the world as soon as possible.
I would like to say that the file brigades in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to each school once a week or once a month to showcase the frontiers of the children in front of the children.
And the new generation will be able to know about this thing that there will be a habit of being careful about the fire brigade.
Regarding the dangers, India is a country full of diversity, both geographically and climately.
This country has suffered many disasters like natural calamities, chemical accidents and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is at the forefront of emerging threats in the country.
NDMA is rapidly arriving for rescue operations in various hazards like earthquakes, floods, cyclones and landslides.
Till two-three years ago, due to heat waves thousands of people lost their lives every year.
The number of deaths due to heat waves in 2017 declined significantly to about 220.
This makes it clear that if we accord priority to security, we can secure it.
There are innumerable people, social organisations, alert citizens in the society, and I congratulate all of them who have been rescued in minutes of calamity.
The number of such unnamed heroes is no less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces and Paramilitary Forces have also reached critical times and brave-hearts are helping people not to save their lives.
We need to create a society that is aware of the danger.
We preserve values in our culture, often speak of protective values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
In our ordinary lives, we travel by planes for hundreds of times, and we see air hostesses in airplanes delivering initial warnings of safety.
We've all heard it a hundred times, but if someone stops taking us on a plane and asks where every thing is, where's the life jacket
So our ears on the plane have a habit of hearing, but we don't think that these warnings are with me.
This is how it happens in every sphere of life.
We shouldn't think that security is for anyone else.
If all of us are aware of our security, the emotions of social security must also be incorporated into it.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, this time in the Budget, with the aim of Swachh Bharat, the villages were focused on waste to wealth and waste to energy.
The objective of the Gobar Dhan Yojana is to improve sanitation in villages, transform the livestock residues and composta and biosa, thereby generating wealth and energy.
India has the highest proportion of four-fourths in the world, with about 300 million cattle and around 3 million tons per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme, this work is also progressing.
Gobardhan Yojana will be beneficial in rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to be a part of this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job and come forward to convert the waste of your village into wealth and to convert dung into dung wealth.
My dear countrymen, we have heard so many festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
However, as a strange initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the States first ever Chevru Mahotsav was held.
Organised by the Raipur Foundation, the objective of the festival was to create awareness about cleanliness and to create awareness about the unique methods of dumping and recycling of dust in the city.
Various activities were organised during this festival, among which the elderly people participated.
Inspired by the programme in Raipur, various cheating festivals were organised in other districts.
Everyone did a lot of things in their own way and shared innovative ideas on cleanliness, discussed and recited poetry.
Congratulations to the people of Raipur, Thiruvananthapuram, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of Chhattisgarh, for the importance of waste management and cleanliness in a remarkable manner.
International Womens Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
A lot of programmes are being organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, I felicitate all those who have done exemplary work in various fields by conferring the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country.
Today, the country is moving towards women led development rather than women development.
I am reminded of the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion.
He said that the concept of complete womenhood is complete freedom, and this concept of Swami ji, twenty five years ago, reflects the perception of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty and responsibility to ensure equitable participation of women in all spheres of social and economic life.
We are a part of the legacy that is recognized by men in the name of women - Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan and Gandhari-son.
Today, our women power shows self-confidence and confidence through their work.
As they advanced themselves, they carried the country and the society forward and took it to a new goal.
Our vision of New India is ultimately a woman powerful, strong and equal partner in the overall development of the country.
There can be several examples of what women power can do and if you look around, you can see such stories that inspire life.
I got something from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand and 15 lakh women have joined the Swachh Bharat Mission for a month.
These women from Jharkhand have shown that cleanliness can become the habit of the common man and the cleanliness culture of the common man in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, in three villages of Elephanta Island, electricity has reached 70 years after independence, and I saw how happy the people there are.
You know, Elephanta Island is on the sea at a distance of ten kilometers from Mumbai.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I congratulate the government and the people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta will now see the light of electricity.
It is not only electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May there be light in the lives of people, joy in life... and when there is more joy and enthusiasm than this
My dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivaratri the day before.
The month of March is the specific feature of this month when abundant farmland with crops, pomegranate wheat, golden harvest and other flourishing mangoes are grown.
And it is a very dear month for everyone to celebrate Holi this month.
On 2nd March, everyone will celebrate Holi with joy.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, Governors of 10 countries participated in the celebrations.
He was addressing the gathering on 1st February, 2019, on the occasion of the commemoration of Calpana Chowla, who had undertaken a space voyage.
The Colombia Space Craft has been separated from us, but has inspired millions of young people around the world.
We have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age. It is a matter of sadness for all of us.
It is heartening to note that these women in India are growing rapidly in all spheres and enhancing the pride of the country.
In ancient times, the honour of women in our country, their place in the society, their contributions all over the world are wonderful.
There is a long tradition of Indian adults.
Tell me about Bachi Bachao, Bai Padhao.
In ancient times, in Skandhapurana, it is said - Dashaputra, Samakanya, Dashaputra, Karmadhyan, the results are available, Marathi, Tat Availability is of virtue.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and ten sons will receive a virtue in a daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why in our society, women are given the status of power.
This woman power embraces the entire nation, the entire society and the family at the bottom of unity.
Whether it is the scholarship of the Vedic era - Loopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi - the scholarship of Akamahadevi and Meerabai, the knowledge and devotional skills of Ahalyabai Holkar, the courage of Rani Lakshmibai, the power of the woman inspires us too.
Increasing the dignity of the country, the Prime Minister said.
Prakash Trithi has given many examples.
He has written to our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sukhoi 30.
He was addressing the gathering at INSV Tarini, a woman member of the Indian Navy, led by Vartika Joshi.
He mentioned the brave women, Bhavna Kamth, Mohana Singh, who were pilots of the Chaturvedi Eye Warfare and trained in Sukhoi 30.
The ladies led by Kashakti Vajpayee are proud to visit San Francisco and San Francisco, USA in Delhi and Delhi in the bowing jute of Air India.
Remember everybody's women.
These women who have achieved Name - First Lady Marchant Navy Captain, First Lady Train Driver, First Lady Volcano Fighter, First Lady Volcano Fighter, First Lady Bus Driver, First Lady Bus Driver at Antarctic, First Lady Everest, First Lady Everest and First Lady of the Everest - all these women who have gained immense significance by breaking the stability of our women power society.
He said that with the help of hard work, dedication and determination, all obstacles and restrictions can be put on a new path.
Not only their contemporaries, but also the future generations have a way of inspiration.
A new zeal and inspiration will fill them.
A book is also being prepared on these women who have earned NEM - so that all the people of the country know about this woman power and inspire you and yourself in their lives.
It is also available on e-books on the Narendra Modi website.
Women power has an important role to play in the positive changes in the country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, I would like to tell you about a railway station.
You must have thought about the relationship between railway station and women empowerment.
Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India with all the workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a Maovad-hit region.
The Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere full of violence, violence, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such a horrible area, tribal women are getting self-sufficiency by running e-Orissa.
In a very short span of time, a lot of women are connected to this.
In addition to this, it will also strengthen environment protection and work.
Appreciating the district weighthouse here, the district government has played a vital role in the success of these women since grants and testing.
Over the centuries, individual and social relentless efforts in our society are not going on against social evils and evils.
A few days ago, such a beginning was made in Bihar.
Thousand kilometres long has been the worlds largest human chain in order to dismantle social evils in the state.
This bandwagon awakened social conscience against abuses such as child marriage and women's system.
The State resolved to fight evils like women's marriage and child marriage.
All the youngsters, mothers and sisters, who are well-advanced, enthusiastic and enthusiastic, took part in this movement.
Starting from the historical Gandhi Maidan in Patna, humanitarianism was unbroken across the border of the state.
The society needs to be free from evils so that everyone in the society can achieve the right direction of development.
Come, let us pledge together to liberate the society from evil deeds and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
He was unaware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana.
Easy now knows about the Jan Aushadhi scheme, where you're buying deserts, the cost of the desert fell by 75 percent.
Over the past few days, I had a lot of people writing about it, I had to say it.
The objective of the scheme is to make healthcare accessible and to enhance the ease of living.
Deserts available in Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50 to 90 percent cheaper than the brandy deserts.
That is why quality deer is available at low prices.
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras are being set up across the country.
Not only does the desert get cheaper, but there is also a new job for those who want to personally find jobs.
Precious deserts are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at Amrit Stores in the hospitals.
The only aim of all this is to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India is created.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh, who is in Maharashtra, has shared a photo in Narendra Modi App.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola have organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna River had flown for twelve months before, and Eli was flowing only during the rainy season.
The river is completely covered with casinos and poles which is painful sight.
A lot of waste is thrown away on the river and its banks.
On January 13, a day before Makar Sankranti, the first step of Mission Clean Morna cleaned up fourteen locations of the river at fourteen locations in an area of fourteen kilometers.
More than 4 lakh people from Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college-school students, daughters, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this programme of Mission Clean Morna.
This programme will continue every Saturday and morning till the Morna River becomes completely dirty.
It's impossible if someone goes out to do something.
Greater change can be brought about through peoples participation.
I appreciate the people of Akola, the district administration and the administration of Akola and all those who have been involved in converting this work into a mass movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about Padmapuras these days.
News has been published in newspapers and TVs.
The Padma Awards are a routine feature every year, but for the last three years, the modalities of the awards have come to an end.
Any citizen can be nominated.
It is transparent because all the processes are online.
In a way, the election process for these awards has changed completely.
In general, in cities, in newspapers, on television, Padma Awards are given to those who are not present at the conferences.
Arvind Gupta has been awarded the Ki Ki-Kay award.
As a student of IIT Kapur, you will be happy to dedicate your life to the creation of toys for these sacred daughters.
He has been making toys with things for four decades, leaving scientific temperament to grow in wells.
He also tried to inspire people to do scientific experiments with materials that are left out of use.
For this, it will inspire Kai Kui, a film produced in 18 languages in more than 3000 schools across the country.
Surprisingly, life is dedicated to surprising.
Similar is the story of Sitava Jodthi in Karnataka.
Don't just tell the goddess of women empowerment.
For the past three decades, Balgau has contributed greatly to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women.
She dedicated herself to Devadasi when she was seven years old and dedicated her life only for the good of Peeth Devdasi.
Not only this, Dalit did what was unprecedented for the good of women.
Because of this interest, the entire world is respected not only in India but also in India.
The exhibition will showcase his films in countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He was given the Padma Shri by recognizing the talent of Kirtiteku Majum Shyam for India abroad.
The story of Laxmiku, a tribal woman in Kerala, will bath you in heart and will be amazed.
Laxmikku lives in KallarA, a tribal hut in Im Kodakka and lives in Panola-Media hut.
It's because of its own memories... that it's about five hundred green deer.
There is a lot of talent in creating a desert for snake charmers.
Lakshmi ji has been serving the society through her own knowledge of the Red Fort.
The nation has honoured Padma Shri for recognizing this personality and contributing to society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without treatment and was inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Built by their hard work, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost at the hospital.
Sometimes they should be invited to schools, colleges and listen to their experiences.
In addition to the awards, some of the efforts of the society should be made.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On January 9th, you returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate an unbreakable bond with Indians living in India and around the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we have planned a programme to invite MPs and mayors from all over the world, in India.
You and the Indian mayors and members of Parliament from various countries including Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Brien, Suriname, South Africa and America participated in the event.
I am glad that the people of different countries living in different countries will not only serve those countries but also maintain their strong relations with India and this time the calendar has sent me to the European Union.
Our people from India live in different countries of Europe, some work for cyber security, some dedicated themselves for Ayurveda, some poetry, some poems and souls of the society.
January 30 is a day to remember Kaitha venerated Bapu.
We observe martyrdom day and pay our homage to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense of our country at 11.
They're not just theories.
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes for 2018 to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
This year's last edition of Mann Ki Baat is the last day of 2017.
I've shared a lot of things with you this year.
A few hours later, the year will change, but the sharing of our ideas will continue again.
We recall the great lessons given by Jesus Christ on the occasion of Christmas, and Jesus gave great importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of the spirit of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhansar used to say, Live with devotion.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Personally, he had to lose a lot in this effort.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the celebrations organised in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 300th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh earlier this year.
Let us resolve to learn lessons from the noble lessons taught by Guru Gobind Singh and learn from that inspiring life.
January 1, 2018, i.e. tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say something special, I repeat that it is really special.
Indias democracy welcomes voters in the 21st century and voters in New India.
The entire India is encouraging you to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
You must be proud to be a voter of the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Voting is one of the most efficient changes in the lives of millions of people.
You don't just have the right to vote.
You can also be the creators of the 21st century by considering how India should be in the 21st century, what should be your dream of India in the 21st century.
The youth of New India is a symbol of zeal, enthusiasm and energy.
The dream of New India is being realized through our vibrant, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it speaks of an India free from casteism, casteism, terrorism and the poison of corruption.
India free from dirt and poverty.
New India is fulfilling the aspirations of all.
New India is the power that guides us in peace, unity and harmony.
Youth of my New India must come forward and analyze how New India will be shaped.
How can we realize our visions before 2022
How can we build an India when our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom struggle a mass movement.
My young friends, we have to organize a public rally to create a magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
A peoples movement of development, a peoples movement for progress, a peoples movement for a talented and strong India.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been opened up for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and industrial entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and successful.
I would like the youngsters of New India to be aware of the opportunities that open up and become aware of the world and these schemes naturally by the time they are 18 years of age.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positive thinking and enthusiasm.
There's a saying in English, Pacimis Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The reactions and reactions that came were truly encouraging.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some people shared the events that have had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact on them.
Some shared their personal benefits.
Sounds like my name is fishing.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm speaking from Bodel.
As per my husband's orders, an amount of one rupee per month was charged by the insurance company.
He died in an accident.
So we only know what our condition is.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our Village to Thiruvananthapuram has been going through National Highway since 2017.
My name is Satish Bawani.
Our area was lacking in water, and for the past 40 years we had been dependent on the soldiers' pipeline.
Now, with a special pipeline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many things that do such things on their own in a positive way of changing the lives of people.
In fact, this is the New India we all build together.
Recently, I got to know about the inspiring story of Amj and Bashir Khan Khattak, who had passed the lead in the Administrative Survey from Kashmir.
He was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination, which liberated him from the agony of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 the terrorists had burnt his legacy.
His family would have to leave the land of their heritage and flee where there was terrorism and violence.
He chose a different path for himself, a way to serve the people.
Avoiding the opposite environment, he created the story of victory.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth throughout the country.
Amjam has proven that the surroundings, however bad, can be neglected by a positive step, without the clouds of despair.
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet some girls from Jammu and Kashmir.
There was enthusiasm, excitement, energy, dreams, determination.
I was inspired by the time I spent with those children.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, and I realized that they are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to mention the Sabarimala Temple of Kerala while talking about the famous religious places not only of my country but also of the world.
Thousands of devotees reach here every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyapaswamy in this world famous temple .
How a big challenge can it be to have so many devotees who come here without waste in such a great place
If there are mountains and jungles, can there be any special mention
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called 'Punnyam Poonavanan' and started an autonomous campaign to spread awareness about garbage eradication.
Any devotee who comes has made a habit that he cannot complete his journey without doing any physical work in terms of cleanliness.
There are no big ones in this movement, no small ones.
Considering that every devotee is a part of the worship of Lord, he devotes himself for some time to cleanliness, works, works to remove dirt.
Every morning the sight of garbage here is surprising and all the pilgrims participate in it.
No matter how big a celebrity he is, however rich he is, however big an officer is, everyone becomes a participant in the programme of sacrificing like a common devotee.
We have many such examples before us.
In Sabarimala, the sacred pilgrimage to such a swachhta mountain turns out to be a part of pilgrimage to all devotees.
There is a lot of hurdles and the determination to make cleanliness is progressing together.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we took a firm resolve to fulfil Bapus birth anniversary.
Bapu has worked and worked for this thing throughout his life.
Cooperation with the people in rural and urban areas has changed widely.
The Swachh Survekshan-2018, the largest survey survey in the world, is scheduled to be conducted between 4th and 10th January, 2018, to assess the impact of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will cover about 40 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
They'll talk to citizens and react to them.
The Swachhta App will also be used and upgradation of various service centres will be reviewed.
It will be checked if all the arrangements are made in the city to become the habit of the city and to become the habit of the city.
Don't let the government run sanitation.
Every citizen and organisation of citizens has a great responsibility.
I would like to urge all the people to participate enthusiastically in the Swachhata Survey, which is scheduled to be held in the coming days.
Try not to keep your city behind, so that your streets and villages are not behind.
According to this survey, the ranking of cities will be carried out - if your city is more than one lakh people, if there is a population of less than one lakh people in the country then it is your dream to achieve the highest position in the local rankings.
Come, with this determination, once again remembering Bapu, we can utilize the best efforts of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem slightly visible but as a society, there is far reaching impact on our personality.
Today, on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you one such thing.
For decades Muslim women have been injustice to women, but no one has ever talked about it.
Even in many Islamic countries there is no such law.
But Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have directed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all the women applying for going alone are allowed to go to Haj.
Usually, I would like to specially consider the women who apply to go alone and avoid this menace and give them a chance to consider it as a special category.
Indias development journey has progressed on the basis of her talent by the strength of our women power.
I firmly believe that our women and men must get equal rights and equal opportunities and we must strive together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
Leaders from ten ASEAN countries will be visiting India to celebrate Republic Day this year.
There are not one, ten chief guests this time on Republic Day.
This has never happened in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and completed 25 years of Indias engagement with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will come together on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is a country of festivals.
I don't think there's a day that doesn't have a connection with the festival.
We just celebrated Christmas, the New Year is coming.
May the coming year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move forward with a new spirit, new zeal, happiness and new determination and take the country forward.
In January, the sun is moving northwards and this month Makar Sankranti will be celebrated.
This is a festival related to nature.
In Rajasthan, all festivals like Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in their own way and they have their own importance.
These festivals will be celebrated between January 13 and January 17.
All the names of these festivals are different but the basic principles are the same.
Once again, I convey my best wishes for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
They are older than us, they are witnesses to every step and every period of the country.
Before leaving for a foreign trip, I was fortunate to have a phone call with Didi.
It was a lovely conversation with brother-in-law.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modi ji-Ladadi, salute.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of your birthday.
May Deepi recover well, and Deepi's blessings be upon us all.
Before going to America, Deepi was calling for an authentication.
It was heartening to hear that Lataji-Modiji's phone call will come.
Will you go and return to me
Everyone at home...
Lataji, I think it is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
You don't know what you are.
I know that as soon as you come, India's picture is changing.
Modi ji yes.
I am delighted to be in this love of Modi ji-Didi.
I am extremely grateful to Modi ji and Didi for always thinking about me.
Once again, my birthday wishes.
Modi ji had come to Mumbai this time and I would like to see him.
Modi ji, but I will be back soon.
Modi ji should come home and have some Gujarati food from the hands of Didi.
Lataji, of course.
I'll be lucky to think of it.
Modi ji-Pranam Deepi
Lata ji.
My best wishes to Modi ji and Didi. Namaste ji.
Modi ji Namaste.
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, from today onwards, the celebrations will once again come together with a new spirit, a new energy, a new spirit and a new resolve.
Festivals will shine all over the country for weeks now.
Everyone in the family will join the celebrations.
This is called the dark under the light.
Perhaps, in this word, not just words, but an order for all of us, a vision, an inspiration.
On the one hand, while many houses are illuminated, on the other hand, you should think that darkness is covered in some of the openings in front of them.
When this darkness disappears, it gives a real pleasure to these festivals when it spreads light.
They're searching people's homes for clothing, sweets, food and finding them and delivering them.
Would you like to try to darken the light in this season of festivals with perfect resurrection and determination
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness during the festivals, your face will glow, your light will be brighter, your Diwali will be more shining.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
Laxmi is considered to be the daughters in our culture because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
Many daughters will be amongst us, dedicated, intelligent, enlightening the name of the family, society and the country.
Can we organize a felicitation programme to felicitate these Laxmis of India on the occasion of Diwali
We have many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things.
Our society must recognize such daughters, respect them, be proud of them.
Together we have organized a massive gathering called Selfie with Daughter and spread it as it has been spread all over the world.
Likewise, this time, a mass movement called Bharat Ke Laxmi will be organized.
Promoting Laxmi of India is a means to strengthen the path of prosperity for the people of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I have said beforehand that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have got the opportunity to talk directly and indirectly to several people who know and are not aware of it.
Alina Thyang sent me a very interesting letter from a student from Arunachal, far away last day.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my exam results came, people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was excellent.
I thought it would be nice if I had read that book before the exam.
And this little friend has given me a job.
But I have a request if you can help me.
I'm sure I read it.
I must try to write in my own words what I think is right.
I once again express my gratitude to this little friend of Arunachal, Alina Tayang, a student.
Look.
This time, as it was discussed in the United States of America on the occasion of victory, it was discussed about the speeches of Representatives of Daniel Medvedev, and a good publicity was also received in social media.
I listened to the speech and watched the game.
The simplicity and magnificence of Dann Madwedev, 23, attracted everyone.
Of course it attracted me.
Shortly before this address, he lost 19 times in the final with Rafael Nadal, the legendary Grand Slam winner in Tenness.
And if there were others at this point, then despair and despair would have been there.
His words were happily welcomed by the audience.
Nadal, Champion of Dan, also lauded how Nadal inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis and said it was difficult to play with him.
The zeal and humility of the man who failed in the same game was worth seeing.
If you don't hear the words of Dan Medveday, I want to tell all of you, especially the youth, that video must be watched.
It's the greatest moments beyond the triumph.
The wins aren't a big deal.
Life is the triumph.
It has been very nicely mentioned in our countrys sciences.
The thoughts of our ancestors are indeed commendable.
It has been stated in the books: Vinaya Veeta Haratina Chetamsi Manujasyamani Kanchana Sanyogyatti Loksya Lochanandandam is that one cannot conquer one's mind if one's efficiency and modesty are together.
In fact, this young player conquered the minds of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, the thing that I am going to say now is for your own good.
There will be arguments, parties and adversaries, but it will be of great benefit if some things stop before it grows.
When it grows very large, it's very difficult to stop things when it grows very wide.
But in the beginning, if we stop it with great caution then many things can be saved.
Tobacco intoxication becomes a habit that cannot be avoided because of nicotine.
Eating it during childhood affects the growth of the brain.
But today I would like to tell you about a new topic.
You must be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
Different from normal cigarettes, e-cigarettes are a kind of electronic device.
A kind of chemical smoke forms when nicotine rich substance gets heated in e-cigarettes.
Like other cigarettes smelling chemicals are mixed in it so that it does not produce stink .
He has seen that even if his father is a chain smoker at home, he is trying to stop others from smoking and he wants children not to be used to smoking cigarettes and bidis.
He also wants to avoid smoking cigarettes at home.
He knows that smoking and tobacco are harmful to the body.
However, e-cigarettes are totally different.
People don't know so much about e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes are sometimes simply curious, so e-cigarettes get access to their homes.
If someone smokes with us, you know we can smell it.
His pocket has cigarette packets, but it can be smelled out.
So many children and youngsters are proudly seen walking in their books, in offices, in pockets, sometimes in their hands, in their fashions, without knowing or knowing or having fashion.
The young generation is the future of the country.
E-Cigarette is prohibited from spreading roots in the society so that this new method of intoxication does not ruin our youth, the dreams of families don't get stuck, the lives of children don't get spoiled.
I urge everyone not to quit the habit of tobacco and misunderstand about e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, don't you
Fit India does not mean that if one goes to gym for two hours morning and morning.
Stay away from all this for Fit India.
Our Mother India, our country is a very great Vasundhara.
Many human jewels have emerged on this planet.
India was the birthplace of such extraordinary people, it was the workplace.
These are dedicated to others, not for themselves.
Such a great personality will be honoured in the city of Vatican on October 13.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians and on the 13th of October, Pop Francis, Maryam Thresia will be declared holy.
Sister Maryam Thresia's 50 years of short life for the betterment of mankind is an example throughout the world.
My dear countrymen, not only India, but the entire world is proud that as we celebrate Gandhi 150, as well as 130 crore people have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
As India stands before the world in terms of environmental protection, the entire world looks forward to India.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the mass movement to avoid coordinated plastic on 2nd October.
In each of the places, people play their part in this trip in their own way.
But a young man in our country has made a very different move.
When I turned my attention to his work, I made a phone call to him and tried to understand and understand his new ways of doing so.
He said that it can be of benefit to the nation and the people.
Shri.
It was a new word for me when I first heard the word "plogging".
Overseas, perhaps this word could be used slightly.
But in India, Ripudman Dalvi gave a big publicity to it.
Come on, let's talk to him.
130 crore people will take a step in this direction and our India will take 130 crore steps towards emancipation of single use coordinated plastic.
Thank you very much, Ripudamman.
Many congratulations to you and your team and this new vision.
I'd like to remind you of something.
But it's time for some to start training, and it's time for some programmes to plan.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that I had told Red Fort on 15th August that by 2022 you would go to 15 locations in India.
Make plans to stay at least 15 places for a night or two nights.
You see India, understand and experience it.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to all of you for the various festivals of India full of diversity.
Yes, yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, you must also keep an eye on the burning of fire or people not being in danger.
We need to take precautions.
Together we can celebrate festivals with enthusiasm, with new dreams and new determination.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
A short while ago, I had the opportunity to interact indirectly with the students from Karnataka.
They urged the Prime Minister of India to write letters to the children of the country in a programme to mark the occasion of Vijay Karnataka Day of the Times Group.
And they published the letters they chose.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children also know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions taking place in the country.
Kirti Hegde from Uttarakhand, appreciating the Digital India and Smart City schemes, the girl said that our education system has to be changed.
If we give children information about nature, perhaps it will be of great benefit to the environmental protection in the future.
Rida Nadaf, a child from Lakshmeshwar, writes that she is proud to be the daughter of a soldier.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud of the soldier's daughter.
Irfana Begum from Kalburagi writes that the school is 5 kilometres from home, so she has to leave home early and return home late at night.
So he says he can't spend time with his friends, and he says he wants to have a school nearby.
But I really liked the press's doing what they wanted to get to me, so I could read those letters.
I feel it's a good experience.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
November 26 is our Constitution Day.
The Constitution Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India on the same day in 1949.
As the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950, we are celebrating that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
Those who read this conversation would be proud of what was the thinking of those who were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked to create the Constitution of our country which is full of diversity
How discriminatory and far-reaching they would have expressed when the country is freed from the chain of slavery
It's not an area of untouchable life, it doesn't matter.
Equality for all, compassion for all is the hallmark of our Constitution.
It is our duty to keep the Constitution literally intact.
Be it a citizen or a ruler, we have to move ahead with the feelings of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should suffer in any way.
Seventeen different committees have been set up in this Constituent Assembly on important issues.
Babasaheb Ambedkar presided over the drafting committee of the Constitution.
He played an important role.
On 6th December, we commemorate and bow down to him as usual on his great death anniversary.
Baba Sahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
15th December is the sacred day of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel became a steel man from a farmer son to a steel man in the country, who had done a very extraordinary job of laying a cargo in the country.
Sardar Saheb was a member of the Constituent Assembly.
The Advisory Committees chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi have been constituted for basic rights, fundamental rights, welfare of minorities and tribals.
I remember and bow down to the brave citizens, police and security personnel who lost their lives.
This country can never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is taking a dreadful shape today, in a way, everywhere in the world.
We have been suffering a lot in India for the past 40 years due to terrorism.
Thousands of our innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
This is the land where Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and terrorism are making cruel efforts to weaken and dismantle our social relations.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to make the human powers more vigilant.
My dear countrymen, on December 9, we will celebrate Navy Day and Navy Day.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the rivers.
This country has infinite bonds with our land and oceans.
When we look at history, the colony, which existed 800-900 years ago, was regarded as the most powerful naval force.
Their navy played a vital role in the growth of the Cholasamy and making them economically superpowered at that time.
Several examples of colony movements and exploration journeys can be seen in collaboration.
Very few people would be aware that most of the naval forces in the world were allowed ladies in the warships late.
But in the corn navy, that too, 800-900 years ago, many women played an important role.
Women even participated in the war.
The Chola rulers had great knowledge of shipbuilding.
When we talk about the Navy, we can forget Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his ability to build a Navy.
Konkan beach was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira and Golden Fort associated with Shivaji Maharaj were either on the sea shore or surrounded by the sea.
The Maratha Navy was waiting for the safety of these forts.
The Maratha Navy had large ships and small boats.
Their navy was capable of attacking any enemy and defending the country from the enemies.
When we think of the Maratha Navy, how can we not remember Kanhaji Angre
He brought the Maratha Navy to a new level and built Maratha Naval bases at various places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy, on various occasions, undertaken Goas liberation drive, but during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, had contributed to its might.
When we talk about the Navy, the war is in the eye, but the Indian Navy has come forward with great enthusiasm in humanitarian matters.
The vessel, Sumitra, helped save the people, safely dispatched several fishing men from the sea to Bangladesh.
During the heavy floods in Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three ships of our Navy arrived immediately and assisted the government and people there.
On 21st November, a merchant vessel was robbed at the Western Gulf and INS Trikand arrived for assistance.
Whether it is to deliver healthcare services to Fuji or to provide immediate relief, our navy has done a proud job in providing humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country in times of need and we Indians are always proud and respected by our security forces.
Whether it is the Armed Forces or the Navy or the Air Force... all Indians salute the courage, valour, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live peacefully for 1. 25 billion people.
Army Flag Day is celebrated every year on 7th December.
It is a day to be proud of the soldiers of the country and to pay tribute to them.
I am happy that the Ministry of Defence has decided to organise an event from 1st to 7th December this year to inform people about the Armed Forces by reaching out to the citizens of the country.
Children and adults should wear a flag all week.
There must be a movement of respect to the army in the country.
Soldiers in schools and colleges can be called to know the army from them.
This can be a great opportunity for our new generation to learn military knowledge.
This opportunity is to raise wealth for the betterment of all the jawans of our Armed Forces.
This fund is being used by the Military Welfare Board to rehabilitate and assist the families of the brave soldiers who fought in the war, and the injured soldiers.
Let us also contribute ourselves for their good.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters something.
Earth is a great part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is entirely related to soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no cropped soil in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
We have long thought of this in our culture and have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to keep agriculture, soil, devotion and gratitude, on the other hand, scientific methods of providing nutrition to soil were part of life.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to soil and nurturing soil in a scientific manner.
We are proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are associated with the traditions, as well as interested in modern science, striving for it and taking rational decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village of Bharmod Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Therefore, the production capacity of soil gradually diminished.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of the situation and recognised the suggestions made by them regarding how many chemicals, other fertilizers, micro-nutrients and bio-farms should be treated as per time.
You will be surprised to know what was the result of the implementation of the suggestions regarding soil health check-ups.
And the quality of soil has also increased.
If we want to think about the crops then first we should think about the earthquake and if we are ready to defend the Mother Earth then the mother Earth will keep us safe.
Our farmers across the country have produced more than 10 crore soil health cards to know and harvest the soil properly.
We devote ourselves to the Mother Earth, but have you ever thought how harmful it is to the mother Earth's health by chemicals like urea
All forms of scientific methods have proved that the use of more urea will lead to serious damage to the Earth.
Can our farmers make a decision that half of the urea used in the fields today will be used by 75 years of independence in 2022
Global warming and climate change are beginning to feel.
There was a time before Diwali.
Now the beginning of December, the cold has gradually stepped in.
An unspeakable boy, 8, made Whistle his weapon.
When he woke up at 5 a.m., he entered the houses in the village, whispered and woke up the people and taught them not to defecate in the open.
Due to this child who goes to 30-40 houses every day and teaches about cleanliness, the village of Kumhari is free from open defecation.
The young Balan Tushar did inspiring work to promote cleanliness.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are determined, capable and courageous.
Every second we get to learn something.
Today, they work well in every field.
Whether it is in the field of sports or in any competition or in any social initiative, our divine people are not behind anyone.
Our divyang sportspersons have won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics, and you will remember the blind T-20 cricket world cup and the champions.
There are various competitions across the country.
The 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur last day.
Our young Divyang sisters and brothers from different parts of the country participated in it and showcased their skills.
One of them is Gigar Thakur from Gujarat and 80 percent of his body has no muscles.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his skills.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers trained at Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar.
My greetings to Jigar Thakur... and my best wishes to him.
Today, the Divyangjans can reach every area and they have special focus on opportunities.
Our endeavour is to make everybody talented in the country and to create a society that involves everyone.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born on this day.
My heartiest congratulations to all fellow citizens.
This proposal is very good, but I feel like adding and making some changes to this proposal.
The elders in our village always say.
Forget your sorrows, don't let you forget your comfort.
Can't you assure your role in this
In the Narendra Modi App, in MyGov or in social media, we can share goodwill at Positive India (Hastag Positive India).
Remember events that inspire others.
Remembering good things will make you feel better.
Energies to do good things.
Let's see the strength of this combined dialogue and its consequences together.
There's a lot to talk about.
PM on 29th October, 2017
In Chhath Puja, the sun and water are important, but bamboo and earthen vessels and cultivation are essential for its worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is a unique culture.
The world will be honoured and worshipped.
However, Chhath Puja is a message to those who are sure to be worshipped.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also associated with this festival.
Before Chhath, the entire house is cleaned and people are eagerly involved in rivers, lakes, ponds, beaches, puja places, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is a celebration of conservation, protection of environment, disease prevention and discipline.
It is natural for anyone to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
You must be happy to know that this kind of business has been done in a store of Khadi and Handloom.
Approximately 680 increase in the sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Diwali
The total sales of Khadi and handicrafts have increased by nearly 90 this year as compared to last year.
It shows that today the youth, women and people of all ages like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how many wealthy families, the poor families and how many families that work in handlooms have benefitted from it.
He says we should also remember our brave security forces.
I think we should deliver home sweets to the jawans.
Once again, I got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the brave soldiers deployed at the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces guard the country from the difficult and difficult situations on the border and respect all the soldiers of our security forces for that struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
If we have the chance, we must listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces are playing a very important role not only in our borders but also in building peace all over the world.
They are enhancing the fame of Hindustan throughout the world as the Peacekeeper of the United Nations.
Last day, on 24th October, United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations in establishing peace in the world and their constructive role.
We consider the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important steps of the United Nations since its inception.
India has always given importance to women's equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was proposed in the opening volume that all men were born free and equal, and as a result of the efforts of Hamza Mehta, representative of India, it was recognised that the volume was made free and equitable by all human beings.
It doesn't seem to be a simple change, but it's a healthy thinking.
The United Nations Peace Mission is one of the biggest contributions made by India under the United Nations.
India has always played an active role in UN peacekeeping missions.
Many of you will be aware of this for the first time.
More than 16 thousand Indian security personnel have served in the UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about seven thousand Indian soldiers are connected to the peace process of the United Nations, and in this context, India is the third largest in the world.
Till August 27, Indian soldiers have served around 50 missions in 71 peacekeeping operations across the world in the United Nations.
These missions were from different parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Liberia, and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian Army and rescued innumerable people.
The security forces of India not only saved the people of different countries but also conquered their minds through people-friendly actions.
Indian women have also played a key role in maintaining peace.
No one knows that India is the first country to send women police forces to the UN peacekeeping mission in Libya.
This move of India has become a source of inspiration for countries all over the world.
Thereafter, all countries began sending their women police forces.
You will be surprised to hear that India's role is not consistent with the Peace Movement, but it is imparting training to the Peace Movement Organisation in about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peace missions are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work to get into difficult areas.
We have to live among different people.
We must understand and understand different environments and different cultures.
The local requirements and conditions of the area must be changed automatically.
Today, when we remember our brave UN peacekeepers, who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salari, who fought for peace in Congo in Africa, who sacrificed everything.
Every Indian will be proud to remember him.
In 1989, when he was seventy-two years old, he was commissioned as Operation Force Commander in Namibia and served as the Freedom Foundation of that country.
General Timaya, the head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for peace.
As a messenger of peace, India has always spread the message of peace, unity and harmony throughout the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move forward as a creation of a better, peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land was brightened by great men selflessly serving humanity.
Sister Nivedita, we call Bhagini Nivedita, was one of those extraordinary people.
Though Margaret Elizabeth lived in Ireland with the name of Nobel, Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
The word Nivedita is completely dedicated.
And then they dedicated themselves to the name and made the name uninterrupted.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for the welfare of the poor by sacrificed their lives due to the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
Sister Nivedita was pained by the atrocities committed during the British rule.
The British not only enslaved our country but also tried to make us mentally slaves.
They have been consistently striving to create an inferiority complex in our midst by tarnishing our culture.
Bhagini re-established the pride of the venerated Indian culture.
Subrahmanya Bharati, a renowned nationalist and Tamil poet, is known for her empowerment.
Bhagini is said to be a vegetarian.
Jagdish Chandra Bose, a great scientist, Bhagini was working in collaboration with Chandra Bose.
They helped spread the boss's research through articles and conferences.
The special beauty of India is that spirituality and scientific are interpretational in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandra Bose are strong examples of this.
Hundreds of people died in Calcutta in 1899 when a terrible plague broke out.
Sister Nivedita started sanitation work on litters and roads without considering her own health.
Sister Nivedita, a woman who walked out to serve the poor while living a happy life.
Inspired by their sacrifice, people came forward to cooperate in service.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes and heroes in building a New India.
You are rightly worried that the diseases that were the only adults before, and the diseases that had been infected by the evening of life, have recently started to appear in children.
It's surprising to hear that children are also infected with diabetes.
But our lifestyle has become a lifestyle.
Today these diseases are said to be lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for occurrence of such diseases to the youth is the deficiency of physical activity in lifestyle such as physical activity and change in food habits.
Societies and families need to focus on this.
If you think about it, you don't need to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make small things properly and regularly practice them and make them self-conscious.
Instead of climbing up and down the child get into the habit of climbing up and down the stairs .
After dinner the whole family will take the children and try to walk a little bit.
Yoga for Young India and Yoga for Youth India.
Because I'm used to it, I'm saying it's easy for a person of any age to do it.
It is easier to learn quietly, and it is better to do whatever it is possible.
There is no need for equipment or plains.
Several studies have been conducted on how beneficial Yoga is in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of life, not as a medium of medicine.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, sometimes I got good news from the games.
Our sportspersons have made the country proud in different sports.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey crown through a good game.
Our sportspersons played a good game and that is why India became Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team and the Sport Staff who helped them.
After Hockey, India also heard good news in Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth made Indians proud by winning the Open Crown of Denmark at the best performance.
After the Indonesia Open and the Australian Open, the Super Series Entertainer won the crown.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing Indias pride.
Friends, this month FIFA U-17 World Cups were held.
Teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills in the football field.
I had a chance to go to see a game.
Players and audiences were very excited.
World Cup Competitions were successfully conducted and all teams showed their best performance.
India could not win the crown, but the young sportspersons of India gave up their hearts.
The entire world, including India, enjoyed the festival of this game and the tournament was an attractive and attractive tournament for football lovers.
The soccer's future is bright.
Once again I congratulate all the players, those who have worked with them and all the admirers.
Some people send pictures of missions of children in this regard and some will be a story of collective efforts of the youth.
A non-governmental organisation called the Ecosystem Protection Organization (Ecosystem) came out to clean the fort of Chandrapur.
During the two hundred days long work, people continued to be tired and tireless to clean the fort as an activity.
I am surprised to see the photographs and the desperate ones who are desperate to see the filth of the surroundings and realise the dream of cleanliness, I would like to tell them that you will directly see the youth of the Eco-system, their sweat, their enthusiasm and their determination in those active pictures.
Your disappointment will turn into confidence.
This great effort towards cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, friendship and generosity.
My dear countrymen, on November 4th, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
By eating together, there was a feeling of unity and equality in the minds of people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to a meaningful life - to cherish, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev wrote what he had to say.
In the coming year 2019, we will be celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
Let us try to move forward through his message and the path of teaching lessons.
My dear countrymen, after two days we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
We all know that he laid the foundation for modern universe India.
We can learn a lot by travelling through the extraordinary life of that great son of Mother India.
His expertise was bringing thoughts into action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had laid the foundation stone of India on one stretch.
He asserted that crores of Indians should be brought under the purview of One Nation, One Constitution.
He was able to overcome all obstacles in his decisive decision making capability.
He had set a goal, he was moving forward with determination towards that goal.
He could have done this task of uniting the country.
Everyone was equal to a nation in his vision.
I would like to say that what Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has said always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Sab are still inspiring and awaiting our vision of New India.
That is why his birthday is being celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge all of you to join me in this celebration of mutual affection and affection for the Renaissance for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new imagination, with a new resolve, all of you will return to your daily lives.
My best wishes to the people of our country to realize their dreams.
Three years have passed since the Mann Ki Baat programme that tells you through Akashvani.
Today's the thirty sixth episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can tell a little less about those who send in their minds from all corners of the country, but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
A few things are about making reforms in government matters.
Sometimes there will be personal complaints and sometimes it will draw attention to social problems.
Whenever I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I remember the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
I am sure that after three years, social scientists, universities, researchers and media experts will be able to analyze this and highlight the contents of every subject.
I am sure that this discussion will be of great benefit to Mann Ki Baat in the future and will get a new spirit and a new energy.
In Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat said that whenever we eat, we should take as much as we need and not waste waste.
But letters came from all corners of the country, social organizations and youth that they were doing this before.
After that, how many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
It has become a big movement not only in India but also in the world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
A new self-confidence and a new pride for every girl.
Every parents wanted to take selfies to their own daughter.
Every girl feels that you are important, that's important.
Last day, I was talking to the Department of Tourism...
I told the people leaving for tourism that wherever they went, they should have linked the Incredible India to the photograph.
Millions of photographs and pictures of every corner of the weight, in a way, are a huge earning for those working in the tourism sector.
I was convinced by Mann Ki Baat that this small incident is a mass movement.
Recalling that it has been three years, events over the last three years appeared very beautifully.
The country is moving forward in the right direction every minute.
It's a big capital for any country, it's a big force.
I offer my heartfelt regards to the people.
Once I talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi was not a dress but a thought-provoking one.
The blankets, the hammers, the curtains... see the interest of the young people in Tail Khadiya grow.
Khadi sales have increased, so the houses of the poor are directly linked to employment.
Khadiyak Rebate is being paid w. e.
This will give strength to the poor in our country and we must do it.
Increasing interest in Khadi, the people working in the Khadi sector have been encouraged to think in a new way in Tail Khadi and Khadi in the Government.
How to introduce new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to introduce solar power
The ancient heritage has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... and we have to think about how to revive it.
We've been involved in a variety of operations.
Several people have been given opportunities for employment.
Khadi Gramodyog Division revived its training wing at Pampore in Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this region.
With the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be able to create new products for growing and working in an innovative manner.
Ordinary people and others have been offered Khadi products as gifts.
We can directly realise how a thing is being promoted naturally.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate Swachhta Festival in the entire country for the fifteen days prior to Gandhi Jayanti.
He said that Swachhta will connect people.
Our Honble President inaugurated this and the nation joined it.
All the elderly people, men and women, cities and villages are now part of the Swachhta drive.
I thank the Honble President.
People from all walks of life in the country are considered to be their own and everyone is associated with it.
Whether it is in the field of sports, in the field of cinema, in the field of education, in schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officials, government employees, police personnel or soldiers, everyone is associated with it.
There has been a change in public places that prevents others from polluting public places, where even those who work have been pressurized a little.
It is a matter of great pleasure that in the first four days of the Swachhata Hi Seva movement, more than 75 lakh people have joined the work related to over 40,000 initiatives.
We're cleaning one place, and others listening to the consciousness of not being filthy.
But if hygiene is to be a habit then it should become emotional.
This time, discussions were held along with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the Swachhta essay.
Thousands of children painted color paintings.
I do not forget to thank the media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They proceeded with utmost sincerity to this public meeting.
They joined in their own way and contributed immensely to creating a progressive environment.
A few days ago, a 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar was paying attention to my work.
As regards Brandy Ambassador, you will think that he will be the hero of the sports field.
If you see plastic, polythene, bottles used and other waste materials, the bill removes them, thereby generating a little bit of income.
Bilalin's Corp Ration provided a vehicle, uniformed, he went to other places to teach people the lessons of hygiene, motivate and remain after it until the results are found.
Bilal Dar, a young child at the age of age, is a motivation for all those interested in hygiene.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of the present history and when it comes to history, it is natural for me to remember the great men.
This is the month of October to remember many great men.
This month of October, from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who gave us the guidance and guidance for the nation, who suffered a lot of hardships for the country, is before us.
It is also centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal Jisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
The common thing was to live for the country, do something for the country...
Gandhiji, Jayaprakash ji and Deendayal ji were miles away from the corridors of power, but they lived with the lives of the people and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi spoke of the last person in the society.
Sardar Sab has united the country.
We have to run for unity and take the unity.
Know the diversity of this India, touch it and smell it.
You can see that these diversities of our country work as a great school for the development of your personality.
Holidays, Deepawali's days... we're used to traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourist journeys are natural.
But it is a matter of imagination that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of our country, we don't understand it, but because of the influence of colour, travel abroad is beginning to be liked.
The people of western India do not know what is in Eastern India.
How diverse our country is
If we look at what Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam ji had said, while travelling in India, it should be noted that they had a new inspiration to see and understand India, to live and die for them.
All these great men have travelled so far under weight.
They also tried to know and understand India at the outset of their actions.
He tried to embrace India.
Can we, as a student, try to assimilate our different states, different societies, communities, communities, their lifestyles, their traditions, their dresses, their dietary values, their understandings
The value addition of tourism is not just because we see it going, but by learning it like a student and trying to become a part of it.
In my own experience, I would have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of the country.
I must have had the opportunity to stay in the night in more than 450 districts.
Today, when I describe this responsibility in India, the experience of those journeys is very useful for me.
I am facilitated to understand things.
I would like to appeal to you that you have experienced the unity of diversity of this vast India not as a stamp but as a storehouse of our immense power.
This is the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of foods are there
Eating every single day for the rest of your life will never have to be repeated.
This is a major strength of our tourism sector.
Not just going out of the house on this vacation, but not going out for a change, go to know and understand something.
India is an inclusion, an inclusion of the diversity of crores of people.
This experience will make your life more prosperous.
Your thoughts will be broader.
Who's a greater guru than experience
Normally, the time from October to March is the time of journey.
People are on their way.
I believe that if you leave this time, you will take this call of mine forward.
Share your experiences, share pictures wherever you go.
Send photos on Hash Tag Incredibleindia.
If you can interfere with the people of the place where you're going, send photos.
Not only of buildings but also of natural beauty, but also of the people's life.
Write a good article about the journey.
Please send it to MyGovi and send it to the NarendraModi App.
I feel that the best seven tourist destinations in your state have been discovered and it will be good for all Indians to know about those seven destinations or seven things that will encourage tourism in India.
If you can, you have to go to those seven places.
Can you give me some information about it
To make films, to make videos, to make propaganda about such good places and to encourage them, the government will recognize your discovery.
You can also be an inspiration to promote tourism from October to March.
I invite you for that.
I have a deep impression on my mind.
I'm a human being like you.
You must have noticed that the people have seen a divine example of women power and patriotism.
The extraordinary feature of this is that husbands of treasure and treasure are serving and sacrificing Mother India.
If we don't have life at this young age, can we imagine what will be the attitude
But the wife of sacrifice Colonel Santosh Mahadek, Swati Mahadek, struck her mind straight away from this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and changed his life to fulfil his dream.
His wife's treasure took a firm decision and joined the army.
We must be proud of our maternal power and it is natural for everyone to feel respected by these heroes.
I convey my best wishes to those two sisters.
They have inspired and inspired millions of people in the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navratri festival and Diwali.
FIFA U-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure there will be soccer tunes all around.
Each generation will have more interest in football.
My dear countrymen, it's Navratri.
It's time to worship Durga Bai.
The atmosphere is full of poor and sacred fragrance.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion.
Festival of Shakti stuff is considered.
By the year 2022, when India will be 75 years of independence, we will move forward in a five year framework to fulfil the dreams of our freedom fighters, the determination of the 125 crore Indians, the measurable hard work, the determination and determination.
Thanks a lot.
English rendering of the text of PMs Speech at Akashwani on 27th August, 2017 at 11.
My heartfelt congratulations to my dear countrymen.
On the one hand, while the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, it is natural to be neutral in the country if we hear the news of violence from any part of India.
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the land of Sardar Patel, who laid down his life for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, non-violence and respect for each other.
We've been saying non-violence atrocities since childhood.
I had said from the Red Fort that violence will not be allowed in the name of faith, be it religious beliefs or beliefs in political beliefs or beliefs in traditions.
The Constitution laid down by Babasaheb Ambedkar has provisions for justice for all individuals.
This country will never allow those who take the law, those who take the path of violence, who are individuals or communities, nor will any government allow them.
Everyone has to bow before the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish criminals.
Our country is full of diversity and these varieties are not consistent with food, lifestyle and dress.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Our millennia cultural heritage can be seen in 365 days, not even a single day of celebrations, in view of cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events.
If we look at all our festivals then we can see that there is no festival related to nature's time boundness.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to farmers and are directly related to those engaged in fisheries.
Today, when I talk about festivals, for the first time, I would like to tell you "my sorrow".
Yesterday, the celebration of 'Swatsari' was held in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the festival is being celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival of 'Thurshan' is the occasion of the anniversary.
This is indeed a surprising legacy.
The Samavatsari festival is a symbol of patience, non-violence and friendship.
It is also known as 'Kashmavani' and this is a tradition that celebrates each other as 'Michmi Dukadam'.
In our scientific scriptures, the terrible bravery landscape, that is, the land of patience.
He who forgives becomes heroic.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, Forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person.
Shakespeare mentioned the greatness of patience in his drama 'Marchant of Venice', which he wrote, "Mercy eas tyves blasphemy, Et Blaste Him dot kiss," which means forgiveness and blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in every corner of India.
The Ganesh Chaturthi festival will take place for 10 days.
The festival is also a symbol of unity, equality and sanitation.
My best wishes to all the citizens of the country for the Ganesh festival.
Now it is the time for celebration in Kerala.
Onam is one of the major celebrations of Indias colourful festivals.
It is of social and cultural importance.
Onam showcases Keralas rich cultural revolt.
This festival not only conveys the message of love and harmony in the society but also instills new zeal, new hopes and new faith in the minds of people.
Now, this festival is becoming an incentive for encouraging travel.
The festival of Navratri in Gujarat and the Durga Puja festival in Bengal have in a way become an attractive tourist attraction.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what we can do on this subject.
Eidul Suha, a few days later, will also be celebrated.
Besides being a symbol of devotion and faith, we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
Various types of experiments are conducted in every family.
Look how big it is, how happy it is.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual resurrection.
I'm glad to know someone's new innovation.
Someone said that an engineer collects some special type of soil and dissolves it so that it is imparting training in building a Ganesha statue.
When the Ganesh is poured into a small piece of water, it melts fast into the water.
He didn't stop so much.
The Swachhta Mission, which started three years ago, will be three years from 2nd October.
Its results have started to appear.
Toilets accounted for 39 and now 67.
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have been declared free from open defecation.
Many people have lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came out, the scum spread everywhere.
We can create an environment of sanitation throughout the country.
After construction of toilets, you can add your name and your family name to the portal.
You can write articles in different languages and you have no age limits.
You can make short films on your own mobile.
A 2-3 minute long film that inspires cleanliness can be produced.
In any language, it can be a silent picture.
Work yourself as a participant.
You will see how bright this October 2nd, which is Gandhi Jayanti.
Imagine how sacred we feel to pay homage to the revered Bapu after the 15-day long Swachhta Hi Seva programme on 2nd October, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to clarify a special obligation towards you.
I look forward to your message with more eagerness than you wait for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything you say gives me an opportunity to learn, so I'm curiously waiting.
I've got a chance to change what I'm doing.
Your little things are useful for me to think a lot of things with a new perspective.
Prime Minister, I'm talking from Pune unnatural.
Once I went shopping with her to the mall.
She spent two thousand rupees simply for a sari, spending 450 rupees for a pizza.
But argued with the auto driver who was supposed to go to the mall for five rupees.
Buying vegetables on the return route, the value earned 4-5 rupees in its name.
I felt so bad.
We don't ask questions about values in big places but we argue with our dependent brothers and sisters for a little bit of money.
They disbelieve.
You must tell me about it at Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a great message through this heart-wrenched phone call.
I am sure that if my people also adopt this habit of behaviour towards the poor, they will leave it for sure.
My dear young friends, all over the country is celebrating Sports Day on 29th August.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, a great hockey player, who magiced in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey were steadfast.
I am saying this because our younger generation wants to connect with sports.
Games must be part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves as the youngest country in the world, we should also visit our children in sports.
Sports is Physical Fitness, Mental Alertness, Personality Enhancement.
What do you want more than that
In a way, games are a great medicine for unity of minds.
Friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a Sports Talent Search Portal to identify talent and talent them.
Any child from all over the country who has made any contribution in the field of sports can also upload their personal experience (biodata) and video.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to select the growing sportspersons.
I am happy to inform the youth that the FIFA U-17 World Cup is going to be held in India from October 6-18.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home.
The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of those six girls working in the navy is inspiring for us.
These six girls left for the ocean on a small boat named INS Tarini.
This is called the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months around the world.
These six children will travel bravely in the midst of waves in the ocean for the first time in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, we also celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
He was the President.
But he used to call himself a teacher.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, a President of India, but in every sense he was an enthusiastic teacher.
I bow to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein, said that it is the supermeart of the teacher to awakening you in creative expression and knowledge that means creativity and knowledge among your students is the most important quality of a teacher.
Can't we make a solemn pledge when we celebrate Teachers Day this time
Can we organise a movement like a mission
Teach to transform, ducate to power, teach to transform, learn to strengthen, learn to guide.
Can we take this mission forward with this determination
Anybody decides to make a decision for five years, guides to achieve it, and feels happy to be successful in achieving it in five years.
For this, create an environment for our schools, colleges, teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of transformation in our country, we remember the teachers in our society just like the mother in our family.
Teachers have a great role to play in transforming.
It must have happened in the lives of all the teachers that a simple effort made to transform someone's lives.
If we work together, we can play a major role in transforming the nation.
Let's move forward with the mantra of teaching for change.
Namaskar, Prime Minister.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the Financial Inclusion Scheme and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you if after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana, which started in 2014, India is economically safer and more robust indicators, whether empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers, villages and ghettoes.
The movement started on 28th August 2014 with a dream in the mind.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed for three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this and bank accounts have been opened.
It is more than the total population of many countries of the world.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor people have invested about Rs. 60,500 crores in banks.
The Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana and Pradhan MantriSurakshaBimaYojana are creating a new faith in the lives of those poor people due to a simplicity of one rupee or three rupees.
Some families received 2 lakh rupees within a few days due to insurance of one rupee in case of the poor, when the life of the chief of the family was lost.
Hundreds of examples have come to me about how a scheme is transforming the lives of an individual, how it fills the lives of a person with a new energy and how it fulfils a new faith.
They can interview such people and inspire the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to you all.
Thank you so much.
It is the speciality of human minds that the rainy season is very attractive to the mind.
There are many adverse conditions due to changing weather and environment.
Over the past few days, people in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North-Eastern States, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, have suffered a lot due to this year.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to assist the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations and cultural organisations and citizens working with the spirit of service are doing their best to help people in this environment.
On behalf of the Government of India, Army, Air Force, NDRF and Para Military Forces are working hard to assist the flood victims.
People's life becomes very nervous due to the floods.
NDRF team has been deployed.
Weather warnings are now almost exactly accurate due to the growth of technology and the progress made in environmental science.
If the timelines for our actions according to the climate signals are gradually turned into a habit, we can avoid major damages.
When I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, it is seen that the citizens of the country are more prepared for it than I am.
I have heard your speech on Chartered Accountants' Day, which has greatly influenced me.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on this day last month.
It gives me great pleasure to hear that things are inadequate and when I write a letter saying that a person living in the north-eastern regions, in the remote mountainous regions, in the forest areas, was afraid that the address was true, and now I started understanding things, I feel that things are much easier than before.
There is a lot of reduction in the time taken from one place to another and the crowd on the highways seems to be very low.
Pollution is declining due to the speed of trucks.
Goods reach targets faster.
A new belief has been created throughout the country as soon as the simplified transformation took place, the faster the transformation took place, the faster the transformation took place, the faster the transformation took place, the faster the transformation took place, the more new registrations took place.
I am confident that once financial experts, management experts and technologists will find a model for Indias implementation of GST and conduct research in front of the world.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
For such a massive change has led us to the summit of success in such a vast country with the participation of millions of people.
The world must learn about it.
All States have a role to play in implementing this GST and the responsibility of all States.
All the decisions were taken together by the States and the Central Government.
What a big dream of One Nation One Tax has been achieved.
I can see how the officers from the village to the centre worked hard, how dedicated they worked, how lovingly the government and the businessmen created an atmosphere of harmony between the government and the consumers and how they played a very important role in enhancing their faith.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments and all the officials of the Central and State Governments for this thing.
GST is an exemplary example of the success of Indias social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is a drive for social reform.
I once again bow down to millions and millions of Indians for making such a massive effort to succeed.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of Revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country became independent.
Several such incidents have been linked to the freedom struggle in the month of August.
This year we will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gather with the freedom fighters, strived hard and suffered.
The trails of history inspire us to build a magnificent India.
Indias Janmashtami united against British rule.
According to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were dedicating their lives to fighting with the mantra of 'Work or Die'.
Millions of youngsters in the country quit their studies and left their books.
They got out of the rage of freedom.
While on 9th August the call for Mahatma Gandhi uit India was issued, the British ruled all the big leaders and Dr.
The great men like Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan were the frontline soldiers.
Behind all this success was the people, the talent of the people, the determination of the people and the struggle of the people.
This effort, which took place from 1857 to 1942, brought this movement to its climax in 1942.
Within five years, the British had to leave India in 1947.
I'd like to connect you to the math.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
For nearly 70 years.
The government's gone.
Success.
The hopes were awake.
As was the crucial years of achieving the goals from 1942 to 1947.
Five years have been accomplished for us, from 2017 to 2022, and we will be celebrating 15th August, 2017 as an opportunity to resolve.
Millions of resolves.
Try to fulfil millions of resolves.
We have to make a solemn pledge.
2017 must be our dream year.
We must be part of the resolve of this month of August.
It is not necessary to work or die today, but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and body to achieve success.
Anything that can be realised in the next five years will be decided.
Youth organisations, students organisations, NGOs and NGOs, etc.
Let us bring new ideas forward.
Where should we be as a nation
What can I contribute as a person
With the help of technology, come up with videos, posts, blogs, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will also launch the uit India uiz for Youth.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce the freedom fighters.
You must propagate this and bring it to the people.
This time also I invite you to share your views on the MyGov App or the NarendraModi App.
I will read it myself and try to talk about it by the time I get it on August 15th.
I'd like to finish at least 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to tell you one more thing today.
There is a socio-economic philosophy in India's economic system.
We don't want to underestimate that.
Our festivals and festivals are not just an opportunity to rejoice.
Our festivals and festivals are an attempt at social reforms.
It connects individuals and societies.
Thousands of jobs are associated with this festival - Rakhis, Rakhis, sellers, sellers of sweets and others.
This is why the families of our dear sisters and brothers live.
We light the lamps of Deepawali not only a celebration of light but also a celebration of houses.
It is directly linked to the poor families that make earthen wings.
But today, when I talk about festivals and the economic conditions of the poor people associated with them, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of this country are more aware and more active than me.
For the past one month, aware citizens have written letters to me about the environment.
They have requested that in Ganesh Chaturthi, there should be an opportunity for people to proactively talk about environment friendly Ganesh.
I owe this cautious citizen.
This time I'm predicting this.
I'm sure you'll all be with me in this regard.
This will help the artisans and poor artists and create idols which will give them employment.
The belly of the poor will be filled.
Come, let us connect our celebrations with the poor, connect the economic land of the poor, let us celebrate the happiness of our festival with the economic festival of the poor and let us strive for this.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens for various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, be it in the education sector of the country or in the economic sector or in the social sector or in the sports sector, we are constantly witnessing the reverence and heightening of the daughters and daughters of our country.
We, the people of this country feel proud of our daughters.
Last day, our daughters performed well in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
The pressure on their faces, the conflict was evident.
I judged things in a different way in that conversation.
I said, "Look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media.
Whether you win the game or not, you won the hearts of 1. 25 billion people.
Young generations of the country, especially our daughters, are actually working to enhance the dignity of our country.
Once again I heartily congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I remind you again of the August Revolution, August 9 and August 15 again.
The year 2022 reminds us of the 75th anniversary of independence.
Every citizen of the country should make a resolve and every citizen of the country should prepare a five year plan for realisation of dreams.
We have to take the country to new heights, deliver and deliver.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with confidence that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
The weather is getting better due to heavy rains in many parts of the country.
The cold winds after the rain have relieved us of heat during the last few days.
Whatever the hurdles in life, however difficult it may be in life or in public life, the rainy season changes our mentality.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and happiness in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world, the Rathotsav of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated.
Those who have learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar, may be aware of the fact that he praised the temple of Lord Jagannath, and the traditions thereof, because they are inclusive of social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people may know that in English there is a word called Jaggernate, which means a chariot that cannot be stopped.
Looking at the meaning of this hypocrisy of this hypocrisy, this word is repudiated from the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
We can understand from this how the world has embodied this chariot journey of Jagannath in its own way.
Everyone celebrated the holy month of Ramzan with admiration and sanctity.
Now Eid is here.
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you.
The month of Ramzan is a month of holy charity and happiness is a month of shared joy.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I was surprised to know that an inspiring incident occurred in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters who come from around 3500 live in that small village, in a way the sisters and brothers of the Muslim family are more than the population there.
During this Ramsan, the villagers had decided to collectively construct toilets.
Spend these 17 lakhs for other needs of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this auspicious occasion of Ramzan an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Each of their actions is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they have made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
Three States - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared this week.
I express my gratitude to the government, authorities and the general public of these five states.
Only then will the habit of body and mind change.
Cleanliness is the same thing.
Some bad habits are part of our habits.
I noticed a very nice thing the other day, and I would like to tell you.
Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh is an incident.
What was the target
In a hundred hours, 10,000 toilets will be constructed in 71 Gram Panchayats.
My dear countrymen, it gives me immense pleasure to see that the common man and the government have successfully completed 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages have become ODF.
In and through letters, through the airways.
Shri Prakash Trirthi recalled the time of the Emergency and presented the date of June 25 as a reminder of the black era in the history of democracy.
It is a commendable warning to illuminate democracy.
Democracy is not just a system but also a culture.
Freedom is the value of constant awareness.
Continuous consciousness is necessary in terms of democracy, so things that have an impact on democracy must be remembered.
And move towards the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable night of democracy.
In a way, the government was turning the country into a carpet.
He suppressed the voices of protest.
Jayaprakash Narayan and other dignitaries were imprisoned.
The judicial system could not escape the terrible shadow of emergency.
Journalists were utterly useless.
Students from today's press sector and those associated with democracy are constantly trying and trying to enhance the awareness of the people towards democracy in the memory of that dark age.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
A year after announcing an emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, which he described in that poem as a state of mind at that time.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian is proud of the world over.
The 21st June, 2017 was a worldwide meeting.
Yoga has welcomed the rising sun rays from the sea to the mountains.
Which Indian does not feel proud of this.
When Yoga was engraved on the threshold of Yoga, Yoga became the link between the world and the world.
Almost all the countries in the world have made Yoga Day an opportunity.
In China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above sea level in Machu Puducherry, the world heritage site of Peru.
People performed Yoga under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in France.
A week-long event was organised at 70 locations in a small country like Singapore.
Ten stamps were released on the occasion of International Day of Yoga at the United Nations.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters organized at United Nations Headquarters.
It was attended by UN officials and diplomats from all over the world.
This time, Yoga has created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 50,000 people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our Armed Forces like BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF have made Yoga a part of the work with their duty.
Some TV channels also propagated it.
Respected Prime Minister said that recently he had said in Kerala that instead of giving away gifts from various places, good books should be given as memorable gifts.
This was started in Gujarat during your reign, but in recent times the use of booze is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to enforce books instead of books across the country
Khadi has also been asked to get encouragement from Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this programme continued, but after leaving that place I quit that habit.
But I was again awakened by this programme in Kerala.
Now, I'm starting to give down a notice on this.
We can gradually make it a habit.
Bobby's life is too short.
I'll give up after I bought it in my hand.
Welcome to Khadi Kilas, however poor families benefit from it.
Costs will be low and will be used in the right manner.
It's been so many years since ueen Elizabeth has preserved the Kailas given by ueen Mahatma Gandhi.
Various kinds of letters are available, many kinds of people are sending letters.
I read a letter the other day, and I'd like to tell you about it.
In the southern part of Tamil Nadu, a family from Madurai, Arulumozhi Sharavan sent me a letter.
Don't know what the letter was.
Considering his children's studies, he thought that something was going on in financial terms and hoped that the family would be able to get some financial support.
I took loans from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started the process of buying some goods from the market.
That is, the Government Departments will look after the registered e-GeM.
They're very interesting in writing to me.
She said, "I got the money under the Mudra scheme, started the business, I got the list of what could be given to me in the e-Gem, I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, from the PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They suggested what they bought at PMO - 2 thermos, 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity to encourage industry.
There is transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship in this.
Government e-Market Place-Gem.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other we can also take pride in our talent in Space Science.
Today, India is hoisting the horizon not only on Earth but also in the environment.
Two days ago, 30 Nano Satellites were launched along with the satellite of ISRO-Cartosat-2 Series.
These satellites include India and 15 countries including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano Satellite initiative of India will be of great help in the field of agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We must remember that a few days ago, the ISRO GST was successfully launched in 19 years.
It was one of the heaviest satellites ever launched by India.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
From that, we can only guess what our scientists have done in the field of environment.
On 19th June, thousands of days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, the mission was aimed at achieving a target of 6 months.
Indias badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth has made the nation proud by winning the Indonesia Open recently.
T.
Usha had the opportunity to connect with the inauguration of the synthetic track of Usha School of Athletics.
The more we connect with the games, the more sportsman spirit grows.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
Sports has a great significance in overall personality development.
There's no dearth of talent in the country.
Children in our family should be encouraged if they want to play.
We all have a dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the season of rains and the continuity of the ambience, this time is a new experience.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and I can say something else in the next Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of PMs Speech at 11. 00 AM on 28.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramsan begins.
On the auspicious month of Ramzan, I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are of utmost importance.
We are a nation that believes in God, denies God, denies idolatry and opposes idolatry.
The art of living together is accompanied by all kinds of ideas, all forms of worship and all kinds of traditions.
Religions, castes, morals, traditions and all of us are a message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramsan will help us move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
I am glad that so many people have experienced me.
What you have to say is an excitement to tell me directly.
I couldn't read everything, not everybody's messages.
But I looked at everything... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new music, some try to learn new things from the U tubele, some try to learn new languages.
I'm very happy to hear you a phone call.
I'm speaking Deeksha Kittyal.
I quit reading habits.
But during this vacation, I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle then how many sacrifices were required for India's independence and how many years of freedom fighters had spent in prisons.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has suffered a lot of sacrifice at an early age.
Therefore, I urge you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am glad that the new generation would like to inform our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this nation.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, many great personalities in the jails had worked literally.
Their pillars strengthened Indias freedom struggle.
Years ago, I went to Andaman Nicobar.
He went to Cellular Jail.
This is the birth anniversary of the brave Savarker.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book Masi Janmashte in jail.
The poems were written on the wall of the prison.
He was locked in a small cell.
A light and a sound show is very inspiring.
People from all the states of Hindustan, speaking all languages, had laid down their lives in this Cellular Jail of Andaman.
My dear countrymen, June is the first Monday of 5 months.
What's your contact with nature
Connectivity with nature takes care of a good land.
Where is it better than Mahatma Gandhi's words
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, We need to take care of the unseen world (One Mast Care Abood A Worldcare One Wildnown Sea) that is, we need to think about the unseen world, where we need to take care of it.
Nature has a power...
You must have experienced that when you get tired and when you get tired then how smooth you feel if you sprinkle a glass of water on your face.
When we get tired, when the windows of the house open, when the doors open, breathe in the emerging window... a new shadow will be felt.
When we are attached to these five elements of our body, our body itself has a new chaitan, a new energy.
We've experienced all this, but we don't listen to it, we don't put it in a thread.
Now, when you are in touch with nature, you must keep in mind if there is a new spirit in you.
So, on June 5, a global movement to engage with nature must engage each one of us.
We are experiencing the benefits of achieving our ancient eco-system.
If we look at the environment, it will benefit the future generations.
May Atharva Veda be the greatest guiding book on the environment, which was created thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth, the son is called Prithviya.
It is said in the Vedas that the humility of ours is due to our land.
The earth is our mother, and we are our children.
In our country, many festivals and rituals are related to the environment.
Whether it is educated, deprived or urban, whether it is a villager or a tribal community, love for nature is a part of social life.
We have to put it in new words and describe it as a new reason.
There are some remarkable stories from the States.
In most of the states, as the rainy season begins, there is a big thrust on plantation.
Millions of trees grow.
School children, social organisations and non-government organisations are coming forward.
This time also, we have to promote tree plantation and contribute to it.
June 21 is a special day all over the world.
World Yoga Day is observed.
In a short span of time, the glory of the 21st June Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world, connecting people to each other.
On the one hand, there are many disruptive forces in the world that make India a major contributor to the world.
Through Yoga, the world has been engraved on a threshold.
As the body connects the mind, the mind and the soul together, today Yoga embraces the world.
Two days ago I had written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga.
Last year, I announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Slowly some steps have been taken in this regard.
I have received some suggestions about this and I congratulate those who have sent these suggestions.
It's a very interesting casualty.
Grandma or grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, males and females, together, make a combination of three generations of yoga and upload the film.
It will be an opportunity to give a new dimension to Yoga today and tomorrow.
The film will be tomorrow, tomorrow, and it will be a pleasant promise tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There's still three weeks left to be World Day.
This is a kind of healthcare scheme.
I invite everyone to be part of this.
When you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at the Red Fort in Delhi and I talked about cleanliness.
I have been going to different parts of India since then.
Some people do what Modi is doing Where is Modi going
I am grateful to him for seeing this thing.
You'll understand this phone call.
Modyji, I speak Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, everywhere, people take special care of cleanliness.
Whether in Mumbai or in Surat, people have collectively taken up cleanliness as a mission.
Not only adults, children are also awake in terms of cleanliness.
Children who blame the street filth are complicated everywhere.
A few days ago, I visited Kutch in Gujarat.
What's more joyous than that cleanliness is associated with my journey.
There may be a habit of making all the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness is a big thing.
It makes everyone happy and inspiring who wants cleanliness.
When Madiji makes such a journey, ask those who invite me, wherever I am invited, what level of cleanliness will be
How many tons of garbage will you dedicate to me
The idea is very good, but I have to think.
It should become an enterprise that the manufacture of so many wastes is a gift instead of gifts.
How many people can be saved from disease.
What a great humanitarian matter.
To see these wastes as wastes as wealth, as a resource.
Don't just see it dirty.
If we begin to see these wastes as wealth, then new methods of waste management will come to our fore.
Youths associated with start-ups will come up with new schemes and new equipments will come up.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, is determined to set up a massive initiative in the field of waste management with the help of peoples representatives from cities.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities in the country are going to provide adequate storage to store solid and liquid waste.
There will be two kinds of junkyards, one green and the other blue.
Kitchen wastes, green skins, food wastes, eggs and leaves are liquid waste and should be deposited in green cave.
They are useful in farming and reminding us that the farming is so widespread and what should be done in green leafyards .
The second nest is for paper, iron ore, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken dubbs, rubber goods, etc.
Versova Residents Volunteers took over the responsibility.
Brothers and sisters, today I would like to tell you something very happy that in relation to the Swachh Bharat initiative, Riyasi Block in Jammu Kashmir has become an open defecation free area.
I congratulate all the people and rulers of the Riyasi Block.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the past fifteen days, everywhere in the newspapers, on TV channels or on social media, the current government is going to count.
Three years ago you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
Several surveys were conducted, many opinion polls were held.
I consider this to be very healthy.
This three-year work has been changed in all respects.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
It's the best way of democracy.
In a democracy, governments must be responsible, and people must be given the accounts of their actions.
I thank all those who have learned different and great opinions.
A constructive criticism strengthens democracy.
For a resurgent nation, this analysis is very important for a brave nation.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and as an ordinary citizen, I feel the impact of good and badness on any ordinary citizen.
As I said, as an ordinary citizen, the impact on my mind is important.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President of India, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Madam, along with others, released a booklet on Mann Ki Baat which is very encouraging as an individual, as a common citizen.
I am grateful to the President and the Vice President and Honble Speaker for giving importance to Mann Ki Baat on the occasion and for giving importance to it in such a high position.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat was given a new dimension.
Some friends also discussed me during the book on Manki Baat.
He said that he wants to prepare a sketch on all the topics spoken in Mann Ki Baat and Akbar gave a art to Mann Ki Baat to express his love without paying a single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbarsahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time when Mann Ki Baat is speaking, the entire country will be flooded, the weather will change, the results of the exams will start, a new study life will begin... a new awakening and fragrance will spread everywhere when it rains.
Let us move ahead with love and affection for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at Akashvani via video conferencing, at 11.
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Children's curiosity, youth's ambitions, experiences of adults, etc.
It is commonly seen that it is people's nature to advise others.
On the train, if anybody coughs while on the bus, the nearest one says, do this, do it.
Advice, advice is in our nature.
In the first instance, when suggestions were received about Mann Ki Baat, I heard the voice of advice, I got something to learn, and sometimes the team felt that it was a habit for a lot of people to send it.
But when we tried to analyze it thoroughly, it really filled our hearts.
Most of those who say these opinions, and those who try to get to me, do something really.
They are trying their intelligence, strength and efficiency to do good work according to the environment.
When this was noticed, I thought these suggestions were extraordinary.
Last time I wasted my food in Mann Ki Baat.
This is an example of how things are going on in collaboration with society.
Today is the end of April, the last day.
May 1st is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature itself has changed all the rules of the game.
Our country had to face the heat of May-June this time in March itself.
Many people have sent suggestions on what should be done during this summer season while taking their opinions from the people for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything is popular, it's not new, but it's beneficial to think about it again at the right time.
Many friends starting with Kartik are worried about birds.
They said they had to put water in the balcony and the terrace.
Young children in the family are very enthusiastic about this.
If they ever notice how to water them, they'll see if they have a bowl and if they have water, they'll go ten times a day.
You'll see if the birds are coming.
We feel it's a game, but it's really a good experience to awaken ghosts in the minds of children.
He lived till he was 103.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation launched a massive campaign to save the pigeons.
I got the opportunity to start it.
They distributed approximately 50,000 saplings to the world.
He found a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes the newspaper giver, the milkman, the vegetables, the postman, when he comes to the doorstep, he forgets whether we want water in summer or not, we are so busy.
Young friends, I would like to tell you something.
Many of our younger generation are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents grow and grow up safely.
But I would like to tell you as a friend how your vacation should be.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes you watch things on television, or read them in books, or listen to experiences... and feel it yourself...
The experiment should be societal, let's get out of the comfortable light.
If we belong to a middle-class family, we belong to a happy family.
You can see that you never had the joy of playing in life before.
Have you ever wondered how a big change will be brought about in the lives of children living like this in the society when they get the opportunity to play with you
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the jungle.
Sometimes there will be summer gatherings, personality development summits...
Various developments will also take place.
Everyone will be busy in their world through technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a force.
Another thing I said is skill and you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
It will be difficult to buy the highest marks and some coaching classes will go on vacation and the next exam will be scared.
But keep in mind if there is no humanity in the innermost part of the world, you must keep in mind if you get away from human qualities.
Can we focus a little more on skill development
You should stay away from technology and spend some time with yourself.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words from a new language - Thiruvananthapuram, Telangana, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi.
Try to learn something you don't know, it'll be useful for you.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a curiosity, understand, discuss with people, ask them... it gives you a different joy of seeing there.
Try and decide the place yourself.
Don't waste time for long journeys.
Go and spend three or four days there.
Then I went to another place and stayed there for three or four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Share the pictures where you're going.

Normally, there is an atmosphere of hatred for VIP culture in our country.
However, I now realise that how deep it is, the government has decided that no matter how big a person is in the country, it will not be able to move around with a red light in a vehicle.
In a way, it became a symbol of VIP culture.
It is learnt from the experience that though red light is placed on the vehicle, it has entered the minds of people and intellectually developed the VIP culture.
Now the red light is gone, so no one can claim that the red light in the head is gone.
I got a very interesting phone call.
I know people are worried on the red light.
I would like to talk about government prohibition of red beacon lights.
I read in the paper, every Indian is a VIP in line.
I was so proud of it.
Thank you for that.
It means, instead of VIP, EPI, Every Person's Important is important for everyone.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remember our history, our culture and our traditions again and again.
It will give us energy and motivation.
This year, we will celebrate the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, 1. 25 billion Indians.
We've been busy with other things to remember for centuries.
Century may be very important for other countries of the world.
Through self-behavior, the society has driven those who have not touched it.
Thousands of years ago, he strove to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
How fortunate we have been to have great men in our society to make our society free from the evils of our society in every age.
On the occasion of the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, let us inspire the idea of Shakti to consolidate social unity.
The Union Government will release a stamp on 1st May to revive the memory of Swami Ramanujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is respectfully bowed down and offered honourable tributes.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is another significance for May 1.
Very few people would be aware that today we are indebted to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect given to the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, we remember the great Karnataka Saint of the 12th century, Jagat Guru Basaveshwar, a social reformer.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend a function.
I had the opportunity to publish his verse.
In the twelfth century, he had thought deeply about the teachings and the learners in Kannada language.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
This means that through your hard work you can reach the shrine of Lord Shiva.
I mean, by working, we can gain heaven...
I often say I'm trying to win.
I often remember what Dattopant Tengdiji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie group, said about the importance of labour.
Today, it's natural to remember Dattopant Tengadi when we talk about workers.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha will be celebrating it.
Ashok's life in India is an excellent example of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that the United Nations celebrates Vesak Day on this great mountain of Buddha Purnima.
This time it takes place in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to honour Buddha in Sri Lanka.
It will be an opportunity to renew his memories.
My dear countrymen, in India, every effort has been made to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas (Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas).
Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global arena.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India-South Asia Satellite Launch Vehicle on May 5
The capacity and facilities associated with this satellite will be helpful in fulfilling South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
Whether it is in the form of a framework of natural resources or in the field of tele-medicine or in the field of education, it will be helpful in terms of people-to-people contacts, even in terms of deeper technology connectivity.
This is an important step by India to enhance cooperation across South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is Bangladeshs Independence Day.
A historic struggle against injustice, a wonderful victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are a legacy of our people.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore composed the National Anthem of Bangladesh.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was that he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but was also awarded the Knighthood status by the British.
However, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised the protest during the massacre of the British in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
It was a matter of deep impression on the mind of a child aged 12.
The boy who smiled at fields and playgrounds when he was a child, inspired a new motivation in the cruel massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
Bhagat Singh was the inspiration of all of us, who was 12 years old in 1919.
On 23rd March the British hung Bhagat Singh and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, there was happiness and no fear of death in serving Bharatamba on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are inspiring us today and today.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
Being a British empire, Moore was scared.
He was locked in jail, he was sure to hang, but the British had the idea of what it was about.
That is why on March 24, those who were set to be hanged were killed on 23rd.
They did it unknowingly.
Then their bodies were brought to Punjab today and the British burnt fire without knowing anyone.
When I first got the opportunity to go there a few years ago, I felt a special vibration in that land.
I will definitely tell the youth of the country - if you have the opportunity to go to Punjab then you must go to the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
Freedom, its intensity, its propaganda was a growing age.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth in the armed revolution.
Gandhiji's thoughts and style of liberation were reflected in Champaran in India's freedom struggle.
Gandhiji came back from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 to inspire the nation.
Today, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran on the basis of what form Mahatma Gandhi has in our minds.
A man, who returned to Hindustan in 1915... for just two years...
It was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard he had to suffer at that time, how hard he had to work.
The Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to recognise Mahatma Gandhis organisational capabilities and talent of the people of the country.
In his behaviour Mahatma Gandhi organised, motivated and fought against the poorest of the poor, the illiterate and the illiterate in front of the British Empire.
Champaran Satyagraha shows us the magnificent power that we can realise the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think of Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a great subject of study for any person who started his public life by thinking of Gandhiji who had done the Satyagraha.
This is the solid foundation of New India, the desire of 1. 25 billion people for change and the effort for change.
New India is not a government imagination, it is not a demonstrator of any democratic party.
New India is the call of 1. 25 billion people.
It is a imagination of the kind of magnificent India that 1. 25 billion people want to unite and build.
There is an idea, an excitement, a vision and aspiration among the hundred and twenty five crore people.
They're doing it like quiet servants, as they do their penance.
There are many who go to hospitals everyday to help the patients.
There's a lot of people running for blood donation when they know.
If someone is hungry, there are many who think about feeding them.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
Our vessels have the imagination of the service of the people.
And if we look at it with social consciousness, how powerful it will be if we look at the organization.
When you talk about New India, you should think about it, analyze it and look at it from a different perspective.
If 1. 25 billion people are determined, if the path is determined and the steps taken one by one then the dreams of 1. 25 billion people of New India will come true in our dreams.
All these things cannot be done by the government through budget and through government schemes.
If we decide that we will comply with the transportation laws, if all citizens decide that they will discharge my duties with responsibilities, if all citizens ensure that they do not use petrol or diesel a day a week...
This dream of a New India will be realized directly in this country of 1. 25 billion people.
It means that all citizens should follow their citizenship and perform their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the last few months, people in our country have been participating in the Digital Payments Revolution and there is a curiosity about how to transfer money without cash.
Even the poorest of the poor is trying to learn it, gradually people are moving towards cashless transactions.
There have been several methods of digital payments following the demonetization programme.
It was only two and a half months since the BHIM App, but so far around 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take the fight against black money and corruption forward.
25 billion people, if they want, they don't have to wait for a year.
It's only six months to do it.
We can do this in everyday life.
You will be a hero in the fight against corruption and corruption.
Several Digital Fairs were organized to teach people this and to sensitize people.
100 programmes are scheduled to be organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
It contained prizes.
Over 12. 5 million people have received subscribers.
Seventy thousand people received presents for traders.
Everyone is determined to go ahead with this method.
April 14, 2018
As scheduled for a long time, this Digital Festival will end on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb on April 14th.
On the completion of 100 days, a big event is being organized.
There is an arrangement for mega rocketing.
We can propagate BHIM App in the days ahead of Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary.
Our role in reducing paid trading transactions.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, I am glad that every time I get a lot of suggestions from people in Mann Ki Baat, but every time there is a need for cleanliness.
The eleventh grade daughter from Dehradun, Gayatri, telephoned and conveyed his greetings.
I want to tell you my Manki Baat.
I want people to understand how important cleanliness is.
I'm going through a river every day, in which people put a lot of waste and pollut the river.
Brothers and sisters, Look at the pain that a child studying in class I is suffering from the pollution of the river.
The child is so angry to see the garbage in the river.
I see this as a good sign.
There has been a new awakening in the country since the launch of the Swachhta movement.
Hate for filth is increasing.
Whether it is awake, be it active partnership or be it masses... it has its importance.
I would like to tell the listeners of my Manki Baat today that Gayatri's message should be a message for all of us.
The stuff that you see is filled on the plate, you can't eat it all.
It doesn't matter what anyone says.
In our homes, when mothers call children, they say, son or daughter, take it as much as possible.
Secondly, to save a little bit, it is financially beneficial for the family.
It's a good thing to think for society, but it's profitable for the family.
I don't insist on this, but I urge the awakening.
I know the young people who do great things related to this.
They've made a mobile app for this.
People call when they find that there is so much tonic somewhere, and they collect the food and use it properly.
This effort is being done by the youth of our country.
We can see such people anywhere in every state of India.
We may be inspiring not to miss their lives and their food.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way of change.
Those who are cautious about health always say - keep your stomach a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
Remember April 7, when it comes to health, World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on depression during the World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if we take the meaning of the word, some people call it depression.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are victims of depression.
If a psychological environment is created then freedom begins.
The first mantra is to speak frankly rather than curtail depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers, teachers what your mind is.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children living in the hostel, will be more difficult.
Our country's size is that we live and grow up in the family... large families are interfering with each other, which reduces the risk of depression.
Otherwise, not when everyone goes out together, I don't come, I don't want to be alone.
Make sure those who can speak openly to him have a chance to sit with him.
Make him smile and motivate him to talk, and bring him out what's in trouble inside.
It's a good solution.
Depression is the cause of physical and mental illness.
As diabetes becomes the master of all kinds of diseases, depression ignores all the ability to fight, fight, take courage and make decisions.
If you can't open your mind to your own people, then seek help from someone with a sense of service nearby.
Help yourself, share your sorrows.
If you try to understand someone else's grief and do it with a sense of service, you will have a new confidence.
If you are connected to others, if you help someone and serve with selflessness, you can neutrally reduce the weight of your mind.
Yoga is the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in many things like getting rid of stress, getting rid of mental stress and expediting to happiness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Last day, the Union Government had taken a major decision.
Welcome to the fact that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and their share is increasing.
Considering the family's responsibilities and the domestic financial responsibilities, the newborns have to work injustice.
Therefore, the central government has taken a big decision.
India has made such a big decision for our sisters.
My dear countrymen, April 5th is the holy day of Ramnavami and April 9th is the birth anniversary of Mahavir Jayanti and April 14th is the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great souls inspire us and may the power to swear for a New India.
Two days later, the Chaitra version, the year of Pratipaksha, the New Year is coming and many congratulations to all of you for this New Year.
Farming is the beginning of the spring season and it is time for the farmers to get the results of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
The New Year is celebrated in the names of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka as the New Year, Chedi-Chand for the Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Shital in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadha.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all for this New Year.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at Akashwani in Malayalam, via video conferencing, at 11.
After the leaves, new leaves are coming to the trees.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and parks become green.
The color of the birds begins to draw the heart.
Not only flowers, but also in the branches of trees.
Summer fruitful mangoes begin to appear in spring.
The lease of Amir Khusro has been very interesting in this regard.
Ameer Khusro wrote: Phul Rahi Sarasom Sakal Bun, Amba Foote, Tesu Fulekoyal Bhole, Dar-Dar
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals all bring happiness to human lives.
A lot of people don't know about the achievements of ISRO.
So they want to inform about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Shosha ji thanked him very much for reminding him of Indias proud achievement.
Whether it is to fight poverty or to escape diseases or to connect with the world or to gain knowledge, technology and science have shown its role.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to elevate the dignity of India to the world.
We all know that INSR has successfully completed many unprecedented missions in the last years.
After the success of Mangalyaan's deployment on Mars, INSRO has established a world record in space the previous day.
ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites from different countries such as USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Switzerland, Turkey, India etc.
Together, India is the first country in the world to create history by taking 104 satellites into the atmosphere.
It is especially heartening to note that PSLV is successfully launched for the 38th time.
This is not only a history of the ISRO but also of the entire India.
Affordable and efficient environmental mission of ISRO is amazing for the entire world.
The world openly appreciates the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is the most important.
We sent some pictures as soon as our satellite arrived.
It's starting its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure that our young scientists and our women scientists have led the entire mission.
The contribution of youth and women is an important component of the success of ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
For the common man, they have always set their goal of bringing about an ecosystem for the service of the nation.
The Ballistic Interceptor Missile of Indias Security Sector has been successfully tested.
You will be happy to know that only four or five countries in the world can achieve this.
Scientists of India have achieved this.
The advantage is that the missile targeting India is destroying it even from a distance of 2000 kilometers.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific templates.
Curiosity has played a major role in human development.
Efforts to know the universe, the laws of creation, the human mind are constantly underway.
New science and new technologies emerge from it.
All the technologies and new forms of science are born in a new era.
My dear youngsters, we speak of the hard work of science and scientists and often I have often told our younger generation to increase their passion for science in Mann Ki Baat.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientists are becoming the cause of a new change in the life of the future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say - "A science did not exist in the perfect form.
All sciences are developed and built on experiences.
Revered Bapu added, I deeply appreciate the spirit, teaching and dedication that guided them in the quest for modern scientists after truth.
Science seeks to utilise those theories with a view to the needs of the common man, what should be the medium, what should be the technology, because it is considered to be the most important contributor to the common man.
Recognizing, displaying and displaying such inventions, disseminating knowledge to people, analyzing how such innovations can be useful for the common man, how to grow more and how to commercially utilize it.
Sometimes the problem shows the importance of science in finding peace.
All arrangements are being made in accordance with technology.
In a way, technology becomes an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, Digi-Dhan scheme was of great importance.
Especially the younger generation is habituated to digital payments through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good suggestion.
Our country has received a lot of support in the last few days from the 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana' and the 'Digit Dhan Vyapar Yojana'.
For nearly two months, fifteen thousand people have been awarded thousands of rupees a day.
Through these two schemes, digital payments in India have been approved across the country.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh subscribers have been given a prize of Rs.
More than 4000 traders received Rs. 50,000 each.
Farmers, merchants, small traders, other entrepreneurs, households and students participated in this event with enthusiasm and zeal.
The award winners include the youth of 15 years and adults of 65-70 years.
Shri Santoshji, Mysore, is writing on Narendra Modi App with happiness and received a thousand rupees prize under the 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana'.
And I thought she was the one who earned a thousand rupees, and I gave them that thousand rupees.
"I am very happy, Mr. Khushboo, and we all are happy with your name and your work.
You've done an inspiring act for everyone.
A young friend from Maharashtra, Pooja Nemade is a Post Graduate student who shared his experience with others about how RuPay cards are being used in the family and how happy they are to use it.
On completion of 100 days of Lucky Grahak Yojana, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary.
The awards will be held on April 14 for a grand prize of crores rupees.
There's only forty-five days left.
Can't you do this thing in memory of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Babasaheb Ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering him, you should also teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
So teach how to sell money, especially the small traders nearby.
Give special importance to Bhim App on Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti this time.
BHIM App should be transported to everybody's arms.
This movement, which has been going on for the last two-three months, has achieved many successes in many townships, in many villages and in many cities.
This year, the farmers of our country have been producing foodgrains due to hardships.
All the clues indicate that our farmers have corrected all past records.
On seeing the crops in the farms, it appears that the pond and the vaishakhi are being celebrated today.
More than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country this year.
The farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and cultivated different pulses in about 290 lakh hectares of farmland.
The government is constantly trying.
Recently, a programme of senior officers of 23 States was held in Telangana under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India.
We can see wealth from waste.
This is proven.
If a 6-member family has a standard double dollar toilet then it will be filled in about six years.
After that, the waste can be brought back to the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste of the hole is completely decomposed.
It is completely safe to handle such decomposed waste and is a very important NPK as a catalyst.
Farmers are well aware of NPK cultivation.
Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are very nutritious and are considered to be very good fertilizers in the agriculture sector.
Like the government has taken this step, others must have taken similar steps.
Several departments are regularly observing Swachhata Hi Seva at the government level.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development, in association with the Ministry of Tribal Development, is going to strengthen the cleanliness drive in the first half of March.
The Ministry of Water Transport and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR), in collaboration with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, is taking forward the Swachh Bharat Mission in the second round of March.
We all know that every citizen of our country will be proud that whatever good he does, the entire country will be filled with pride and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all the players in the team.
The country is proud of the achievements of our divine friends.
Divyang brothers and sisters are capable and determined, courageous and imaginative.
Every second we get to learn something from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or of climate science, women in our country are no more behind anybody.
He is walking on foot together, accomplishing accomplishments and ushering in the name of the nation.
Our women have won silver medals in the Asian Rugby Sevens trophy over the past few days.
My best wishes to the players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Today it's not just a government program.
People's thinking has changed over the years of practice.
It is heartening to hear the news that the girl was born to be celebrated.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls has become the cause of social recognition.
In the district of Gudallur in Tamil Nadu, it was found that child marriages were blocked due to a special public rally.
Around 175 child marriages have been stopped so far.
Under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, the district government has opened bank accounts for more than 50,000 girls.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathwa District of Jammu and Kashmir, all sections have been linked to the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao programme, besides organizing Gram Sabhas, the district administration is making a lot of efforts to adopt orphan girls and ensure their education.
Under the Home Visit of Harghar Dastak in Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized to educate the girl child in every village and in every household.
The scheme titled Our Children, Our School, Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, has been implemented to inspire the middle class girls to re-school and re-school them.
In short, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme has taken many shapes.
I see it as a good sign.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country enjoys the rainy season, on the other hand there are festivals and fairs in every corner of India.
This will happen till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have maintained an integral and economic scale and the shape of social life.
In the past, we have celebrated many festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to todays problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Despite all these significances, take up the job of the driver in the battlefield.
Sometimes you pick up the mountain, sometimes you pick up the leaf.
I mean, there's a new feeling about Krishna's all things.
So while I talk to you today, I'm attentive to two fascinating people.
One is a sight-spoken moon and the other a charmer.
Sudarshan Chakraborty Mohanan left the Yamuna coast in Gujarat and settled on the seashore of Dwarka and Mohanan, born on the seashore, reached Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna in the last days.
We can learn from the message of Lord Krishna whether the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling in the midst of every noble thought of life.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new pillar of human history was established.
His commitment to service, service and service had always been a part of his life.
He set an example in his life by way of service.
Mahatma Gandhi had individuals, society, mankind and humanity.
Whether it is in the phoenix family of Africa or in the Tolstoy family, whether in the Sabarmati Ashram or in Wardha, he always emphasized on social harmony in his own way.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to bow down to several great places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi gave importance to organisational consciousness in a spirit of service.
We need to bring about the emotions of social service, social growth and social organisation in our practical life.
In the true sense, it is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, it is a true legend.
There may be occasions like this, and we'll get together.
But what is Gandhi 150
As an individual, what can be shared in these efforts
Imagine what kind of value addition you can see.
Ladies Club.
Let the work being done at the Ladies Club of the Modern age continue, but let all the members of Ladies Club work together to do some service.
A lot of things can be done.
Creating old books, distributing to the poor, disseminating information.
130 crore people will have 130 crore dreams and 130 crore initiatives will be launched.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha in Dandi during the freedom struggle was a great milestone.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I would like to urge you all to visit some place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
Wherever it may be - Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, Ashram in Wardha, there can be somewhere related to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your films with the social media, and others should also be inspired.
This time, at the Indian Pavilion in Venice, Benale, there were exhibitions showcasing many interests related to Gandhijis memories.
Haripura panels were particularly attractive.
You will remember that the Mahasammelan of Congress was held at Haripura in Gujarat and the historical event of Subhas Chandra Bose was chosen as the President.
This art exhibition has a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Convention of the Congress, in 1937-38, the then Principal Nandlal Bose was invited to Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India and to showcase his artwork at the Mahasammelan.
Along with his artistic constitution, Nandlal Bose was also blamed.
Nandlal Bose visited villages near Haripura and ultimately painted some pictures depicting the life of rural India.
These invaluable works of art were discussed in Venice.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to all Indians on the centenary year of Gandhiji.
For the country, for the society, for anyone else.
This will be a good, true and meaningful message to Bapu.
Dear Fathers of Mother India, in the last few years, we have been running a programme called 'Service for Cleanliness' for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will begin on 11th September.
This time we have to give special importance to plastic.
On 15th August, I had reminded from the Red Fort that with much enthusiasm and enthusiasm, 1. 25 billion people had organised a mass movement to clean the filth and worked towards getting rid of open defecation.
Likewise, we have to stop using single-use plastics together.
There is a lot of enthusiasm for all sections of society in this regard.
Several of my brothers and sisters in the business sector have also placed a board in front of the shop in which the buyers have to bring the bag.
It will also save money and enable them to play their part in protecting the environment.
This time on 2nd October, when we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate ourselves to him an open defecation free India but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Let's turn it into fuel.
What is a bigger inspiration than Gandhiji
My dear countrymen, our cultural texts are in a way enlightened.
We'll get what we need in our lives.
I would like to say a great deal through a Sanskrit translation.
This is something written centuries ago but it is still very important today.
There are three jewels of water, Annam and Subhas Chandravana.
Stupid people call stone stones as gems.
Anna had great glory in our culture.
We even made the knowledge of that science a science.
The awareness about the nutritional requirements has been transforming the country into a mass movement through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and attractive ways.
Accordingly, during the harvest season, the volunteers of Anganwadi are collecting one drop of grain from the people.
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women.
After that, the individual dedicates himself to this goal and becomes the hero of that peoples movement.
All of us must have heard of an event called Annaprasht in families and in all parts of India.
It's the first time it gives children rice meals.
Not liquid, but solid food.
Somewhere, people donate food.
Whenever there is a day of birth, acrobatics and memories in the family, the family members make nutritious diets and take them to anganwadi or school and serve themselves to the children from their families.
Sharing their happiness and sharing others.
It is a good coordination of service and pleasure.
Friends, there are small things like this that can successfully fight against malnutrition.
Today, the poor and the rich suffer due to lack of knowledge about nutrition and malnutrition.
The month of September will be observed as a nutrition month across the country.
And you must be part of it, add something new, and your role in it.
It means that if you save someone from malnutrition, then we save the country from malnutrition.
Whenever I went last weeks, whenever I met people, 'Man vs.
I have never imagined that there will be a chance in life to touch the minds of the youth worldwide.
What's happening
I went to Bhutan last week.
Since then as the Prime Minister, whenever I got the opportunity to go anywhere, since then whenever I got the opportunity to sit with everyone because of the celebration of International Yoga Day, somebody has been asking me about Yoga for five-five minutes.
There will not be a great leader in the world who doesn't discuss Yoga with me, this is my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel is planned to be broadcast in 165 countries.
I am confident that this episode of the Discovery Channel will go a long way in introducing the world on the topics of environment, global warming and climate change, including Indias message, Indias traditions, and natural sympathy in Indias cultural journey.
Today, people want to know about the steps taken for climate protection and a clean environment in our India.
You've been shooting many times, what happened
I ask you with great curiosity.
Look, there's no secret.
I'll tell you the secret because many people have this question in their minds.
Not a secret.
The truth is that technology has been sufficiently used in conversations with Bear Grills.
Whatever I say, it was translated into English, and he was listening to a small apparatus in the ear of Bear Grills.
I mean, I was speaking in Hindi, but he was listening to English, so it was easy to talk, and it was a miracle of technology.
After this show many people talked to me about Jim Corbett National Park .
You and Nature must go to places related to wildlife.
I have said this before, and I reiterate that we have to move towards the north-east of India.
Spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, in India, the thoughts and anxiety of the environment are naturally visible.
Last month, I had the opportunity to issue Tiger Senses in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
It was only half a year ago.
In the case of tigers, a Tiger Summit and Tiger Summit were held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010.
Expressing concern over the decline in the number of tigers in the world, the Prime Minister made a decision.
By 2022, the world was determined to double the number of tigers.
But this is a new India and we are achieving the goals faster.
We have doubled the number of tigers by 2019 itself.
The number of tigers in India has more than doubled the number of protected areas and community reserves.
Gir took several steps one after another in the forest.
In 2007, he decided to appoint female guards.
Increased infrastructure to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about conservation.
We have to think of empathy beyond conservation.
We can see very good advice on this subject in our sciences.
Listen to what has been said in our sciences centuries ago, Nirvana Vadhe Vaigharo, Industrial Rescue Forest, Forest Vagharo Bridge, Forest Vagha Bridge, that is, if there is no forest, tigers are forced to enter and die among human beings.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893
This young Indian Sanyasi, capturing the human race all over the world, has established India's shining personality in the world.
On 11th September, 1893, the words of the great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change the perspective of India.
Come, let us strive to live in the true strength of the India that Swami Vivekananda saw, and where Swami Vivekananda saw it.
But I'm not going to enter the details.
Wait till August 29.
We will strive hard to get rid of plastic, both at home and abroad.
I am also confident that this movement will be filled with social media.
Come, let us move ahead with a new zeal, with a new determination and new energy.
Let us move forward by showcasing the inner joy with the spirit of service.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at the Valedictory Function of the Republic of India, at 11.
My dear countrymen, greetings to everyone.
On January 26, our Republic Day, everyone celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every part of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, our commitment to democracy, is a kind of cultural festival that makes the future generations more aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities and culture.
However, however, the kind of debates that should be held in our country about the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, the deeper and the more widespread the discussions take place.
Within two minutes, it reflects a social perspective and determination and respect for the martyrs.
Everyone has a natural respect for the army and security forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do one thing that I specially appeal to the youth, which is very enthusiastic about social media
On the one hand, when we were happy to hear the 26th of January with joy and enthusiasm, the warmth of the brave soldiers of our armed forces who guarded the security of the nation in Kashmir came upon us.
I pay my homage to those brave soldiers and salute them.
My young friends, you are well aware that I regularly express my mind through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The months of January, February, March and April are the period of examinations in all the families.
When I came to know about this topic, many teachers, parents and students texted me, asked me questions, instructed me, pained, pained and talked about suffering.
I would like to share with you the thoughts of my mind after seeing them.
I received a telephone message from a child named SRISTI.
Listen, creation says - Sir, I want to tell you that there is a terrible atmosphere in our home, neighborhood and society at the time of examination.
That is why children have a mindset instead of being encouraged.
Those who are happy with the exams are very few.
For most people, exams are an opportunity of stress.
That's when it's good inside us, that's what comes out.
There is a feeling that there is strength in the society during the festival.
The best shows up.
During the exams, an atmosphere of enthusiasm must be created between family, friends and neighborhoods.
You see pressure turning into plasters, and stress becoming happy.
The excitement makes the mind weightless.
Look, it's going to change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup to Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, the examinations are conducted in these three months.
You must understand that the power to invite memories is the best in a quiet mind.
If you're in tension, all the doors are closed, the outside will not come in, the inside won't come out.
Thus, it becomes a burden.
I say from my experience, if there is mental stress, we will be forgotten, if there is peace, we will be able to imagine things, which will be of great benefit.
The problem is not that you don't know. It's not that you didn't work hard.
But when stressed, your wisdom, knowledge and learning are overthrown, and your mental pressure subjugates it.
It looks like a life-threatening problem.
You'll think the exams you're going to write are the tests you've done throughout the year.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed because of that defeat, if he had failed to live, then India would have achieved such a great scientist and would have achieved such a great President.
The competition has grown, and the pressure among students has increased.
Mark and Mark Sheet have very limited use.
That's all in life.
Life is going forward depending on how much knowledge you have acquired.
If you believe in these things, the Mark Wall will chase you, and you will never need to go after Mark.
Your knowledge, your skill, your confidence, your determination, your determination.
His experience, knowledge and success.
Therefore, the weight of the Mark prevents us from going in the right direction.
But if you pay attention to the market, you will gradually limit yourself to certain things, just to make the marks.
This is a very psychological struggle.
In fact, competition is not useful for leading life, it is necessary to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How can the day be better than last day
How can the chance be better than the past
You might have often seen it in the playground and you will know it very quickly, so you can give the example.
The specialty of their lives is that they compete for themselves in the field of players who are the most victorious.
You weren't sleeping because of the stress of the exam before, are you sleeping now
Secondly, you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than what you've done before.
Beautiful parents share their views.
He said that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
Because mothers are more conscious of the future of children at home, the work is in vain, they make things simple.
When you learn to accept, most of the problems will end there.
So I have to tell parents that you're doing this to children sometimes.
Have you ever thought that during the exams, you should give children laughter insights
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very interesting phone call came.
Because I did something like that when I was a child, and I tried to copied once when I was a child.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find a way out of it, so I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
Sometimes when I don't believe in my own talent, I'll look at the next person, I'll check if I'm right.
Perhaps my name's right, and the next man's writing is wrong.
It's gonna make ourselves falsify too.
I mean, it's not very useful with cheating.
Falsehood is a kind of a thing, so it doesn't matter.
Fucking makes you bad, so don't fucking do it.
What kind of Prime Minister asks the children to play at the time of the exam, I am angry.
It is generally understood that students are careless about learning if they focus on sports.
This conception is wrong.
This is the basis of the problem.
If there is a comprehensive development, there is a life outside books, and it is very vast.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to shape life.
It's called maintenance.
In my view of the exam, three things are important: right rest, secondly, sleep for the body, third intellectual activity, and the body has a large part.
So the rest of the body needs a chance to work.
Have you ever thought of going out in front of you to see the sky, to see plants and trees, to make your mind happy
Long breath is very loose to stress.
You don't need to be in the room for a long breath.
Some think they'll sit late in the night and learn more.
You must sleep as much as you can for your body.
So you won't lose your time to study.
A fool who came to see me about it asked, "How long do you sleep"
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while addressing the gathering, your close voice is linked to sleep.
If you sleep sufficiently, your vokel code will be relaxed.
He gave me a very big medicine, not thinking about sleep and my voice about vokel code.
It doesn't mean just sleeping.
So don't do that.
If you can, don't do it if you can...
Or it would be a burden, and I would like to advise your family's parents not to be heavy.
Remembering your emotions, go to the test by believing in your own talent.
My best wishes.
Festival of exams to win all exams.
And it won't be exams.
Please take this spell forward.
My dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all Coast Guard officials and jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard is ranked as the 4th largest coastal force in the world with 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in our country.
In order to fulfil this ideal, the Coast Guard personnel remain in adverse conditions to protect the maritime environment and maritime environment of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard jawans, with their responsibilities, took up a major goal of cleaning the coastal areas of our country.
Thousands of people took part in it.
It is indeed admirable that they thought of maritime hygiene along with coastal security.
Very few people would be aware that not only men but also women are successfully responsible in the Coast Guard of our country.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are not only pilots and observers but also controls the Hovercraft.
My best wishes to the people of Indian Coast Guard for the glorious work of securing Indias maritime security and forty years of Indian Coast Guard.
Spring Festival is being held on 1st February.
Spring is recognized as the best trumpet.
Spring is known as the king of sums.
In our country, spring is the festival of Saraswati Puja.
It is considered an opportunity to worship the scripture.
Not only this, but also a celebration of inspiration for the heroes.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola - This is inspiration.
My best wishes to the people of my country on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat has also given a new look in their own way.
Since last month, Mann Ki Baat has started listening to local languages after my Mann Ki Baat.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for their motivation and congratulations to the people of our country.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good wishes.
Today is an occasion for service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, "The poor are not our favors, but our recognition."
"Jesus has not only served the poor but has also appreciated the service done by the poor," said St. Luke.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them everything.
Two days ago, I had the opportunity to launch several development projects in the holy land of Malviya ji, Banaras.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohana Malviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre being set up there will benefit not only the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Bharat Ratna, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have glorified the country for its might.
Atal ji established great ideals as the Leader of the Party, as the Lok Sabha and as the Minister and as the Prime Minister.
I bow to Atal ji on his Jayanti and pray to God for his health.
As an activist, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
A lot of memories are showing up.
This morning, when I was filming, I shared an old video on how I had got the opportunity to celebrate Atal ji's affection as a small worker.
Today, in Christmas, the people of the country are going to get the benefits of two schemes as Christmas prize.
In a way, the scheme was launched on the second day of November.
There is an atmosphere of curiosity all around in the country, whether it is village or city or educational or illiterate, whether it is cashless or cashless, how to deal with cashless transactions, how to buy goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and know each other.
In order to promote this, Government of India is launching incentives for consumers and small businesses to strengthen mobile banking and become e-payment habits.
This is not just a day today, but it will continue for 100 days starting from today.
Every day, fifteen thousand people get a prize of Rs.
Within hundreds of days, millions of families will receive a prize of crores of rupees, and you will be eligible for a prize in the form of digital payments like mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USD etc.
Digi-dhan trading scheme is primarily meant for traders.
This scheme is meant for every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Therefore, this award will be given to those who buy more than Rs. 50 and less than 3,000 rupees.
Those who buy goods worth more than Rs. 3000 will not receive this award.
The poorest of the poor will be able to buy feature phones through USD ordinary phones, sell goods and pay money so that they can be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the award scheme.
And I know that if you ask them, they will tell them everything and if you ask them, then you will have children studying in 10 or 12 in your family and they will tell them very well.
It's as simple as you send messages to the Watts App on your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, the knowledge of how technology can be used, how e-payment can be done and how online payments are being expanded very fast in the country.
Over the past few days, cashless trade has increased 200-300 times.
Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The business community can very well guess how big this decision is.
Digital payment traders are also encouraging online payment mode instead of observing their business by way of relaxation of income tax.
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Someone said that the Government of Assam has decided to exempt 10 discount on payment of Immovable Tax and Licence fees digitally.
If the branches of rural banks make at least two digital transactions between January and March, with 75 of their customers, they receive a reward of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
The Government has announced that 100 Digital Transmission Villages by 31st March, 2017 will be given a prize of Rs. 5 lakh under the Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transformation Programme.
They also announced the Digital Agricultural Shiromani Programme for the farmers and accordingly, the first 10 farmers to undertake Digital Payments for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers would be given Rs.
I appreciate the Assam Government in this regard and appreciate all the governments for the initiatives like this.
Several organisations have adopted a number of successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
Focusing on fertilizer mainly, GNFC - Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited has established thousands of POS machines in Fertilizer Selling Centres to facilitate farmers.
The most interesting thing is that in comparison to last year, fertilizer sales of GNFCs have increased by 27 percent.
A nation like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youngsters have made great strides in startups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies, with newer schemes, our youth must give priority to this sector as much as possible.
Thus, we can be a partner in the entire movement to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month at Manki Baat, I ask people to share your opinions and tell you what to say.
MyGov and the Narendra Modi App have received thousands of suggestions this time about 80-90 percent of the fight against corruption and corruption, and when I saw everything, I felt that I could turn the rudeness into a third.
Some people have explained in detail about the various difficulties and inconveniences faced by people.
Another group wrote that this is a good thing, for the good of the country, for the sake of such a sacred thing, and how all kinds of falsehoods are going on and how many new ways of deception are being found.
I am grateful to the people for helping me with so many letters.
The emotions of Gurumani Keval appear in every corner of the country.
We all realize it.
When people suffer, when suffering, when suffering, who are those people who don't suffer
I feel the same pain you have.
I clearly know that if 1. 25 billion people stand together, nothing is impossible and people are God's image. The blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people for taking part in this great campaign against corruption and corruption.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, everybody has to follow the law.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money are trying their best to find the shortcomings of the government.
This government is for the common people.
He is constantly trying to find out the opinions of the people.
What is the difficulty of the people, what is the law that troubles them, what can be solved
As a sensitive and efficient government, how many laws have to be changed keeping in mind the comfort of the people, the aim is to reduce the sufferings of people.
On the other hand, I had already said it was an extraordinary struggle on the eighth day.
For 70 years, how powers have been accompanied by black money transactions that are full of belief and corruption
How powerful are they
When they are determined to fight such people, they are also adopting new methods of defeating the government.
When they adopt new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You're gonna make me ten - because I've decided to make corrupt people, smugglers, without black money.
On the other hand, there are many other letters from which all kinds of frauds are taking place, and how to find new methods.
In this context, I would like to heartily congratulate my dear countrymen.
The number of information that is available in the government system is more than that of the common man.
It's almost possible to win, because the common people are awake.
Would anyone imagine the dangers that the vigilant people of my country are challenging to bring such macro-powers to light
They say, Modyji, don't be weak, don't stay, no matter how hard the footwear is, if you're out, you're gonna have to get to the goal.
I would particularly like to thank those who wrote such letters because their letters have faith and blessings.
I took it out, enacted a powerful 'Benami Property Act'.
In the days to come, that law will start working on it.
Whatever one has to do for the welfare of the nation and for the welfare of the people, it will be a priority.
My dear countrymen, last time I had said in Mann Ki Baat that our farmers had broken the records last year in the midst of these hardships.
It is a good news for the agriculture sector.
Last day, in the global economy, India has been proud in many fields, and as a result of the constant efforts of our people, India has been able to see the highest in the global rankings through different indicators.
India has improved its rank in the World Banks Doing Business Report.
India ranks third in the Top Prospective Host Economics for 2016-18, as per the Global Investment Report released by Dutch.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and 19 ranks in the World Banks Logistics Performance Index 2016.
The same progress is being made in the same way as many other reports are being assessed and India is progressing rapidly.
But it gives me immense pleasure to see some good things happening in this situation.
The Government is committed to the Divyangjans.
I personally tried to accelerate this move.
My aim was to get the rights and dignity of the disabled persons.
Our Divyang sisters and brothers became stronger in our efforts and faith when we won four medals at the Paralympics.
They not only raised the pride of the country through that success but also surprised the people by their talent.
Our divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, are an invaluable wealth and power.
I am extremely delighted to note that after the passage of this Act for the welfare of Persons with Disabilities, opportunities for employment for Divyangjans will increase.
The Government has increased the reservation limit for jobs to 4.
The Act also envisages setting up of special departments for education, other facilities and grievances for persons with disabilities.
It can be guessed from the fact that the government has taken sensitivity to the Divyangjans in the last two years, the government has organised 4,00,500 shrines and distributed equipments to 5,80,000 Divyang brothers and sisters.
The new legislation has been passed by the government in accordance with the wishes of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyangjan was of seven types.
Talasemia, Parkinson, and Dwarves have joined this gathering, my young friends.
Over the past few weeks, news from the games made us all proud.
As an Indian, it is natural for us to feel proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won a four-four-fourth victory against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were commendable.
Captain Virat Kohli gave good leadership along with a good batting.
Indian Cricket Team (ICT) offspring bouler R.
Junior Hockey team made the World Cup.
The Junior Hockey team won the World Cup after 15 years.
Many congratulations to the youngsters for this achievement.
This achievement is a good news for the Indian Hockey team.
Our ladies were also surprised last month.
Indias womens hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy, and just a few days ago, Indias women hockey team won the Venkal Medal in the Under 18 Asia Cup.
Christopher, I heartily congratulate all the players of the Hockey team.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
In the last month, we were celebrating Diwali.
Some wrote poems, some painted films, some painted cartoons, some made videos.
I mean, how many houses were turned into military posts.
I'm surprising how imaginative and visionary I still see these letters.
With your participation, the book is prepared by providing you with your vision of the country's army and your vision of the security forces.
A soldier wrote to me, Prime Minister, we will celebrate all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali on the border.
At every minute, he is immersed in the idea of protecting the country.
However, there will be reminiscence of the house during the celebrations.
But to be honest, it didn't happen this time.
Celebrating, I didn't think it was home.
It was a feeling that we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
As the nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases by 125 crores.
A few days ago, all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir also came to see.
They were people of Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in Kashmir valley.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
However, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order, and the future of the children came into existence when the conversation progressed.
I am glad that all those villagers who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled their promise.
They went to the village and even alerted people far away.
A few days ago, while the board examination took place, about 95 percent of the children in Kashmir participated in the examination.
In the Board exam, so many of the children participated in it, it is believed that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education for a bright future.
On 8th November at 8 pm, addressing the nation, the Prime Minister said that a great step would be taken to bring about change in the country.
The more important it is, the more important it is, the more important it is, the more it is, the more it works, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more important it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be, the more important it will be, the more important it will be, the more it will be, the more it will be done and the more it will be done in our normal life.
I had said that it would take 50 days to get out of the impact of this decision and that such a big decision would be made to return to normalcy after 50 days.
500 and 1000, such a large country, such a large number of currency, crores of notes and notes are watching the entire world carefully and all the financial experts are analysing and evaluating it.
25 billion people of India see if they will succeed by suffering difficulties.
There can be a question mark before the world.
It is a great honour to the 125 crore Indians.
We believe that this decision will succeed and our country will prove to be gold.
It is for you all the citizens of this place and you all are responsible for this path of success.
All components of central government, state governments, local local local bodies, 1 lakh 30 thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank officials, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working day and night in this direction with dedication.
In the midst of a variety of mental conflicts, all of them are very quietly regarded as a patriotic philosopher and are active in an effort to make a great transformation.
Starting in the morning, he works without even knowing when the night ends.
In the midst of all this hardship, officers at the bank and post office work.
In terms of humanity, they seem to be two feet ahead.
An accident occurred in Khamdwa
Suddenly there was a need for money
It was heartening to know that when one of the bank's officials noticed, he himself went to the bridegroom's house and paid enough money for treatment.
Innumerable stories like this can be traced everyday through conversations with media, newspapers and others.
We are trying to save the black money by misleading the poor, tempting them and depositing their money into their accounts or doing something else.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said - Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
Tarali village in Taluk, Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This will give a boost to the people and a cashless economy is very important for nation building.
I am with the country in this regard.
I am glad that you have withdrawn the notes of five hundred and one thousand.
I would like to thank you sincerely because no one thought that you would take such a big step when your father called Din Ayenge.
He taught the blacksmiths and corrupt people a good lesson by removing the notes of five hundred and fifty.
Every Indian cannot have a better day.
People from all over the world have learnt to say 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
But I didn't know I was going to get married at the Chai Pe Church.
I am aware that there was a wedding in Surat on 17th November with the Chai Pe Charcha.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea to those who came to her wedding.
There were no processions, no food programs - because the money was slightly disturbed by the withdrawal of the note.
People find the best ways to deal with a problem.
People are finding their own ways.
Look at this change.
Large bonded people who think they won't ask, they don't pay exactly, their dues will be very much left.
If every municipality has 50 percent of the money.
However, due to this decision on the 8th, everyone ran away to shut down their old notes.
In 47 cities, about 3,500 crore loans have been sanctioned during this period.
You'll be surprised and happy to hear that, but this week we've been split into a handful of tens of thousand crores.
There are many examples of this kind of direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages, our farmers are a strong bulwark of the economy of this country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economic system, every citizen is being fought in the midst of difficulties.
There is a significant progress in lending to them under the Mudra scheme.
Lakhs and crores of rupees have been disbursed under the Mudra Yojana because crores of people run these small businesses and give a boost to the business of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to be disturbed by this decision.
But now our small businessmen, using technology, are serving customers using mobile apps, mobile banking, credit cards, and serving customers on trust basis.
I would like to tell these small businessmen that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Put POS machines to use credit cards.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be used in the entire business of your village.
You can't be exploited.
I know you, the young men of my country, liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you are very much involved in taking this matter forward in an effective manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, my good friends.
It is an opportunity to take the country to economic heights and a wonderful opportunity to serve the mother India.
My young men, can you help me
Perhaps your family doesn't know the elders, the parents, the parents, the father-in-law, the uncle and the mother-in-law.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how to book online tickets.
For you, it's all normal, you use it.
But today, the country wants to do a great job of creating an indifferent society.
It is true that a society that does not see a hundred percent.
But can't we become a slightly observing society
Once you start a little bit of society building, the unfathomable social structure cannot be far away.
You are aware of the opportunities that today provide to a distracted society, digital banking or mobile banking.
All banks are providing online facility.
All the banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own walts.
Walt means e-pers.
Various types of cards are available.
Crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards under the Jan Dhan Yojana.
The usage of very few RuPay cards has increased by 300 times since the 8th.
As the prepaid card is available on the mobile phone, the prepaid card is available for the bank to spend the money.
Moreover, technology is making it simple and unnecessarily smart phones.
I have emphasized on making these arrangements more simpler.
All the banks are trying to do it.
My young friends, despite all this, there is a great generation who doesn't know anything.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I see your creative message on the Watts App - prints, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations, toys.
But, my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this regard.
Your mobile phone will also have technologies to spend online.
Moreover, every day, half an hour, an hour or two, teach at least ten families what this technology is, how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in your account, how to pay the debtor.
Once you teach people how to use the RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
If you teach the common man these things then perhaps they will get rid of all the concerns.
I don't think it will take longer if all the youngsters of India take up this thing.
Within a month, we will be able to present a New India before the world.
You can do this on your mobile phone, you can go to 10 homes a day, you can connect ten houses a day.
I invite you, come and not only support, but we can be the commander of this change, and rest after change.
We will take this fight to get rid of corruption and black money in the country.
The country made a revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again urge you to take this movement forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCC, NSS to do this together.
Let's take this forward.
We have got the opportunity to serve the nation well.
You shouldn't miss this opportunity.
As you may have seen, Amitabh Swachhta Abhiyan, the most famous artist of this century, is moving forward very heartily.
That is why he also remembered the birth anniversary of his father and cleanliness.
A sequence of Harivansharai ji's poem has been written, "Man body, heart full of joy, invisible life, that's me.
Cleanliness drive in the veins of his son, Shri Amitabh Ji is flowing like blood.
He has written to me through the poem of HarivanshRayaji - Swachh Body, Swachh Manch, Swachh Bharat.
I respectfully bow down to Shri HarivanshJi.
Thanks a lot for all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and happiness.
India is a country that celebrates any festival every 365 days in any corner of the country.
We have seen the courage to end untimely festivals.
Changes in festivals are naturally accepted as per the requirements of time and society.
Do it through festivals.
Our ancestors have been associated with festivals in a scientific manner.
Today, we are discussing the environment around the world.
Whether it is trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, it is a celebration of responsibility for all.
That is, in our country, the tradition of celebrating holidays with the brahmand and scientific bonds has been shaped.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, as I have said, this festival of ours brings knowledge and knowledge.
This Deepawali conveys the message of Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya to the light from darkness.
Cleans all parts of the house.
We need to enlarge and enlarge this nature and heritage.
Deepawali is no longer confined to the borders of India.
Deepawali is remembered and celebrated in one way or the other in all the countries of the world.
Several governments in the world, parliamentarians and rulers there have been celebrating Diwali.
Whether it is eastern or western countries or developing countries, whether it is a developing country or Africa or Ireland, Deepawali is celebrated in the United States of America.
Canada's Prime Minister, Deepawali, has shared a lighting film on the screen.
The Prime Minister of Britain organized a variety of festivals in London, connecting all communities, and attending the Deepawali celebrations.
What's in the picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia has extended an invitation to people from various cities of Australia to join the Deepawali celebrations, in congratulations to the Indian community.
The Prime Minister visited New ealand last day.
He said that he has to return to the Deepawali celebrations soon.
This is reflected in the fact that this festival of light, Deepawali, is becoming a motivational festival to take the world from darkness to light.
The urging parents to stay close to the adults when the children break the burial, not to make mistakes, and to avoid risks in the mind.
The festival of Deepawali in our country is a little longer.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern part of India.
It is indeed an opportunity for all of you to convey my best wishes for Deepawali or Chhath Puja.
It is also an opportunity to express gratitude and thank the people of our country.
Our soldiers have sacrificed everything for peace and tranquility due to the events that have taken place in the past few months.
As we all celebrate Diwali, our soldiers suffer all the hardships, some people in the desert, some people in the Himalayan peaks, some people wait for industrialists and some wait for the airports...
How many responsibilities do it
Words, birds, tablets, colors, innumerable imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I tell you the truth that because of my liberty and gift of joy, you sleep peacefully because I sleep peacefully, because you have the boundaries, the mountains, the smiles, the glory of India, and I bow down to you, and I bow down to you as well as I bow down to you.
My dear countrymen, Shivani, a sister filled with her parents' house and husband's house, gave me a telephone message.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivani Mohan.
Our military brothers and sisters get a lot of encouragement from the launch of the Message to Jawan programme for Diwali.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
Boundary Officers are receiving very good messages of encouragement and encouragement from all of them in the Army Circle.
The Army Officers and their families and their wives sacrifice a lot with Solgiers.
In a way, the soldiers get a good message and wish you all the best Deepawali.
My dear countrymen, we can see the soldiers standing not only on the border but also in all walks of life.
Our soldiers are working with national emotions in every sphere of life, in the face of natural calamities, in the face of enemies, in the face of enemies, in the face of natural calamities.
Earlier it was Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be like that on 1st November.
His village is named Badhana.
He arrived there and discussed the construction of toilets.
Some families did not have access to toilets due to financial hardships.
The Swachhata Abhiyan has been strengthened by providing 1,000 rupees to 57 families from their own pockets.
It gave Himachal the strength to make open defence free.
Malayalam village is a village that is difficult to reach the forests far away from Kerala and can walk on foot all day long.
People don't go there.
The cadets and volunteers of the National Service Scheme and engineering students have decided that they will make toilets there.
Things are going on in every state at a fast pace.
I just said something.
I compliment all the citizens of these states for their contribution in making this great event participants free from dirty darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, the government's schemes will be very comfortable and after the first one such project will have to be abandoned and the first project will be abandoned.
But in general, no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us.
You decide according to this criteria.
We now have to face the awakening hopes of the country's poor, which is the need of the hour.
Now there are girls and toilets in schools, boys have toilets.
It is no longer possible to make it 20th century and still dark in the village.
Therefore, the programme of electrifying the village to get rid of darkness is progressing successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide a smoke-free life to 5 crore families and we are moving towards success.
Small merchants, small businessmen, vegetable vendors, milk sellers and bargainers were caught in the clutches of robbers.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand Up Programme, Jan Dhan Accounts etc.
Deposit of funds directly to Aadhar Lutte Bank and Direct Benefit Transfer to eligible entitlements
It's an opportunity for the common man to get rid of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who lived the life of the great man of this country, the unity of India.
31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the birth anniversary of the vibrant Mahapurush of the unity of the nation
I believe that he has succeeded in it and he has joined everyone together.
On the same day, we can say that Indira Gandhi was slaughtered as the opposite of the country's fate.
On the birth anniversary of the great man who lived his life for unity, the cruelty of Sardar's birth, a history of history pains us.
We must keep ourselves away from the thoughts of different souls and the actions of different societies and keep our nation away from them.
Sardar Saheb's journey of life started in the fight for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had an important role in the freedom struggle for the farmers.
Now, sometimes we hear the name of Auli.
People from all parts of the country and abroad are familiar with all the products of valuables, however, very few people know that the idea of cooperative milk producers is a result of Sardar Saheb's vision and Kheda district was known as Kera district at that time.
He gave importance to this idea in 1942.
How it was, is apparently in front of us in the form of a price based price for the happiness and prosperity of the farmers.
I respectfully bow down to Sardar Sahib.
On this single day, wherever we may be on 31st October, we must remember Sardar Saheb and remind ourselves of unity.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Deepawali is a milestone in the Kartik Purnima, a festival of lights.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Devji is not only a guiding factor in India but also for the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty and good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev ji made Lalo his colleague when there was untouched variations of casteism and hypocrisy.
Let us follow the enlightenment that inspires us to abandon the differences and to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, who will be a better guide than Guru Nanak Dev
Tributes to Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of this Prakash Utsav.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Diwali in the name of the soldiers of the country.
May your dreams and your imaginations come true in all senses.
May your life be comfortable and peaceful.
English rendering of the text of PMs speech at Akashwani via video conferencing to the people of India on 25th September, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
We lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these heroes and pay homage to them.
This loss was lost to the son, lost his brother, not only to those families who lost their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
There are many opportunities for family and political leaders to speak.
All parents want all schools and colleges to start functioning altogether.
The farmers also want their crops, fruits and vegetables to be marketed across India.
I mean, financial business also wants to be right.
Over the past few days, businesses have been doing well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the way of peace to our problems, the path of progress and the path of development.
We need to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will come together to find peace for all the problems and will show the right path for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the families of Kashmir is the responsibility of the state.
The Government will have to take certain measures to carry out the legislation.
I would like to tell the security forces that the use of the powers and regulations with us is for orderly order and for a comfortable and peaceful life for the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from what we think come up with new ideas.
I have got the opportunity to learn a lot from the social media in the recent past.
It provides an opportunity to understand and understand the emotions of people from all corners of India, which promotes the power of democracy.
The eleventh grade Harshavardhan presented a different idea to me.
He wrote, I felt sorry after the terror attack in Uri, I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do, what a small student like me can do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative point of view.
But when the war was going on in 1965, we were led by Lal Bahadur Scientist, and there was an excitement, anger, patriotism.
Everybody wanted to walk something, and thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Scientists worked very well to touch this emotional level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Scientists have shown that all the asses will have other ways to express patriotism in the midst of the noises of the bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi led the struggle for freedom, when the struggle was going on in a strong way, when it seemed necessary to take a step forward, it was a very effective way to bring that power back to the creative tasks of the society.
Let us and the army discharge their responsibilities, let the rulers discharge their duties, and if we the natives and all the patriots play a creative role with the zeal of this patriotism, the nation will certainly scale new heights.
Dear Countrymen, Shri T.
Karthik wrote to me on the Narendra Modi App, composed history of the alttes that went to the Paralympics, their performance was the success of human consciousness and human spirit.
Not only you two, we have taken an emotional bond with our players who participated in the Paralympics in all the countries.
Perhaps the Para Olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have changed the attitude of humanity to the divine.
I don't forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
When she won the medal, the sister said, through this medal, I have defeated the disability itself.
These words have great strength.
This time in Para Olympics, 19 Lights including 3 women from our country participated.
Compared to other games, willingness and determination are greater than physical talent and sporting skills in the games of Divyangjan.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals with the biggest achievement ever. Two gold, one silver and one bronze won the second gold medal in Paul Volt 12 years later.
He was losing his hand because of the electrocution.
Just imagine, a man who won the gold medal at the age of thirty-thirds and won the second gold medal at the age of thirty-three.
Mariapean Thankavelu won the gold medal at the hypocrisy.
Thankavelu was only 5 years old when he was left.
Poverty is not hindered by his determination.
He doesn't live in a big city, not a middle-class family.
While leading a life full of hardships, despite physical hardships, he won the medal for the nation with determination.
If it's Light Deepawali, it's rocked by a variety of winners.
Varun C.
Bhidi won the Venkala Medal at Haijam.
It is also important that in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, we have been motivated to look at our divyang brothers and sisters.
We need to revive our empathy and also change our perspective towards the Divine.
A few days ago, there were Olympics at the same place.
Is it possible for anyone to imagine that even the records of the general Olympics have been broken down by the Divyangs
This time it happened.
In the coming days, India is trying to make a smooth plan for the Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people who were there, people were surprised.
I had the opportunity to publish a book, which was a collection of success stories in the lives of some disabled persons.
Very enthusiastic events.
I believe that the establishment of world records in the soil of Navsari of India is very important.
Within 8 hours, 600 Divyangjans were able to get machines for those who can't hear.
It found a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has taken a hundred and twenty five crore steps towards cleanliness.
I am sure that we are moving in the right direction and how good the results are and what is happening with some effort.
Therefore, every common man, every ruler, every ruler, every officer, every citizen, every village, every farmer and every woman, everybody, everybody, every bus stand, every railroad, every school or college or religious institution, everybody from every child to the elderly, everybody plays an important role in the cause of cleanliness.
Friends from the media also played a constructive role.
For the sake of health, for the glory of the fathers, especially for the glory of the mothers and sisters, the heights that are defined in the open must be abolished.
Open Defecation Free (ODF) has started a public movement called Open Defecation Free (ODF).
States and States are conducting healthy competitions between districts and villages.
The States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be able to achieve the goal of sanitation sooner than before.
Come on, let's move forward firmly.
Especially in the recent past, I would like to introduce a scheme to young friends using technology in a big way.
What is the peace in your city with regard to cleanliness, everyone has the right to know, for which the Indian government has given a number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you make a phone call in 1969, you will not only be able to understand the conditions related to the construction of toilets but will also be able to apply for the construction of toilets.
You benefit from it.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has also been launched to know about Swachhata related grievances and redressal of grievances.
You must make the best use of this, especially the new generation.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate world to move forward.
Sponsor the young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
Swachh Bharat Fellows can be sent to the districts.
In today's era, health has been associated with hygiene and sanitation is essential as well as a model.
It must be part of the waste to wealth.
Therefore, we must move towards waste to compost with the sanitation mission.
Fertilizer told companies to get ready to buy compost from waste.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are going to hold detailed discussions on cleanliness and hygiene.
What can we do with technology
This is how jobs can be replaced.
Discussions will be held on topics such as:
I see new news coming up on cleanliness.
Recently, I was told in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University had gone to 107 villages to spread awareness about the creation of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, who travelled 2800 km from Devprayag to Gangasagar in Ganga and disseminated the message of Swachhata.
Each department of the Government of India has prepared a one year time table.
I urge the Fathers to keep in touch with the activities of these departments without any hesitation in their respective areas.
Everyone has been taking care of cleanliness recently.
Earlier, survey of 73 cities was carried out and the level of sanitation was presented to the people.
Now it is the turn of 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
And in every city there will be a confidence that this time we have lagged behind and next time we will do even better.
October 2 is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
This will illuminate the lamp of Diwali in the house of the poor and this time it is October 2 and Sunday.
You cannot join yourself in evacuating filth in a furnace and participate in it for 2 hours or 4 hours directly.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something serious for the nation.
Joy of Giving Week is going to be celebrated in many cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
For the needy, it is a move to store food items, clothing and others.
The centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay begins today.
Antyodaya theory is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the last person at the end.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
Concentrate on how the poor can accomplish the benefits of development of society, society and society.
I respectfully bow down to the respected Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, who was an inspirational man and enriched by our ethical heritage.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, I started Mann Ki Baat on the day of Vijay Dashami.
I've tried myself not to be funny about what Mann Ki Baat has done.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme of political tactics and accusations.
How a common man in this country inspires me.
It means that Mann Ki Baat has become a new opportunity for social transformation, not just 15-20 minutes ago.
Anyone else would be more happy than this.
English rendering of the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's speech at Akashwani via video conferencing on the 23rd August, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey Magician Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He contributed significantly to Indias Gold in Hockey in 1928, 1932 and 1936 in Olympics.
We've heard of Bradman's name, everybody we love cricket.
He spoke of Dhyan Chand as the High Scores Golds Leak Treasures.
Dhyan Chand ji was a living example of Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once upon a time in Kolkata, an opponent attacked Dhyanchand with a hockstick on his head.
So there was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dhyan Chand replied that in the next 10 minutes, he had scored three goals and responded with rounds.
My dear countrymen, several suggestions are received in the MyGov or the Narendra Modi App during the Mann Ki Baat.
There are diversities.
But this time everyone has expressed their desire that I must say something about the Rio Olympics.
I look forward to seeing the common citizens so close to the Olympics and so awakening that the Prime Minister of the country is eagerly urging them to say something about it.
There is so much love and warmth among the citizens of India in the field of non-competitive sports.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are no more than anyone.
It seems that girls across India have taken up the mission of nurturing India.
Shikhar Thakur wrote in MyGov that we could have performed better at the Olympics.
For the first time, I convey my best wishes to you all for your two medals in Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to our performance.
Our parents are still focusing on studies and academic issues.
Society still considers sports to be a waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
The spirit of society has to be enhanced.
No one can do this better than you.
We can't deny that we couldn't perform a demonstration like we wanted.
In some species, our sportspersons performed well in India, but did not show any good performance here.
We got only two medals in the medal list.
But if we don't get the medal, we can see that in many categories our cinema has shown a good show.
You see, our Abhinav Bindraji reached fourth place in the shooting and lost his medal in a very small difference.
This is exactly what happened in Tennis about the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopann.
We performed well in athletics.
Simple Babar qualified for Track and Field Finals for the first time in 32 years after Usha.
It is also a pleasure to know that the Lady Hockey team arrived at the Olympics after 36 years.
For the first time in 36 years, the men have come to the Khockey Out Stage.
Our team is very strong.
Many players, such as Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal and Anu Das, performed well.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if you do as you do, perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I'll draw up a roadmap on how we can be better.
2020, 2024, 2028.
The state governments should also create such committees, what can we do in the field of sports and what can each of our states do.
States should choose one or two of their own species that can show strength.
I also urge Sports Associations to conduct an analysis of neutrality.
I urge every citizen of India to send my suggestions to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Up.
We are fully prepared.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers Day for years, like a student.
I learned a lot from little children.
For me, September 5 was Teachers' Day and Teaching Day.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 summit so I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
The teacher has as much place as she has in life.
I've seen teachers who are more concerned about their own people than their own.
They dedicate their lives for their pupils, for their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, we hear about Pullela Gopichand.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, his penance, his dedication to Sports, and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnanjis birth anniversary is being celebrated as Teachers Day.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today, he seems to be teaching me in classroom.
I can tell you that he is giving me the Currency Point Course even today.
And when he sees his handwriting at the age of ninety, he wonders if he writes such beautiful letters at that age.
My letters are very bad and I feel very honoured to see someone's good letters.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival is approaching.
The Ganesh changes the obstacles... so that our country, our society, our family, and each of us have no obstacles in their lives.
Lokmanya Tilak, who started the General Ganesh Festival, made this religious festival an occasion to awaken the country.
Even today, Ganesh Festival is taking place not only in Maharashtra but in every nook and corner of India.
Every youth is organising a lot of preparations for this festival and it will be very encouraging.
Some people are still trying to imitate the emotions that the world's superstitious has put forward.
Common issues are discussed, articles were held, flower games were organized.
In this context, the subjects that touch society are presented in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a massive movement of public education is being undertaken during the Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak inspired us to say that Swadesh is our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of society.
The festival brings a new life to the lives of individuals and communities.
Life is impossible without a festival, but it has to be shaped according to time.
This time many people have specially written to me about Ganesh festival and Durga Puja.
Use Ganesh ji made of mud in the village pond.
Statues made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment.
He and many others have suffered a lot.
I also urge you that we should build statues of Ganesh and Durga Devi and return to our ancient tradition.
Ganesh is a dissident.
That's why we shouldn't make a disruptive Ganesh.
I don't know how much I'm gonna accept this, but many say it's not just me.
Several such institutions work hard and propagate soil-made Ganesh.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
The ecology of the lake is not negative because it merges into the lake with the rod.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will be declared Mother Teresa Holy on 4th September.
Mother Teresa used her whole life to serve the poor of India.
It is natural for every Indian to feel proud that Mother Teresa, who served the poor for the rest of his life, has got the status of Holy One.
The Government of India is sending an official delegation led by our External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj for the 125 crore Indians to celebrate the 4th of September.
We get to learn something from the saints, the sages, the sages and the great men every moment.
We'll make something, learn, do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a peoples movement then how big a change happens.
Jan Shakti is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with five State Governments, has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and connect people with it.
On the 20th of this month, a meeting of village chiefs along the banks of the Ganges was called in Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for this idea.
I thank the Chief Ministers of the five states for the great Kalvip to clean the Ganga by collecting the Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, sometimes something touches my mind and sometimes I have a special respect in my mind for the people who have created those ideas.
On July 15, more than 1 lakh students from over 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents that they needed toilets and toilets in their homes.
And they asked them to make toilets even if they didn't celebrate their birthday this year.
This is what inspires us.
A 16-year-old girl from Kopal district of Karnataka, Malma, who made an honest fight against her family.
The family was financially incapable.
And the child stood firm.
The village chief, Mohammad Shafi, who was witnessing the satyagraha for the toilet, arranged for 18,000 rupees and made toilets within a week.
The strength of the girl Malma and the village chief like Mohammad Shafi deserves to be praised.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have made it their target.
This information is available on the website.
Winners will be given the awards on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October for the Short Films competition.
I want to tell the TV channels that you too have to make such films and compete.
Creativity will also strengthen the eradication of waste, new slogans will be given, new methods of understanding and new inspiration will be given.
This can be done through the participation of people and ordinary artists, whether it is a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Many may feel that the President wants to inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not an ordinary radio channel, it's a big step.
Our neighborhood is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
Here Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Betar, where they will share their programmes with each other and people from both sides will enjoy the shows of Akashwani.
Akashvani's contribution in building personal relations is immense.
This was inaugurated by the President of India.
I also thank Bangladesh for their cooperation with us in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their participation abroad as well.
My dear countrymen, you gave me the job of Prime Minister but I am a man like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch my heart more.
These emotional incidents inspire and inspire people to do something for the people of India.
My heartfelt condolences to millions and millions of mothers in India who have stood up to help others with their own misery.
My dear countrymen, we suffered last year due to famine, but this month of August is full of difficulties due to continuous rains.
Floods occurred again and again in some parts of the country.
The state governments, central governments, local institutions, social institutions and citizens have tried their best to do whatever they can.
But there have been some other news in the news of floods, which must be remembered.
The month of August this year reminds us of the strength of unity and how big a transformation can be made if we move together.
Around 90 parties across the country and almost all the parties in the Parliament passed the GST legislation in consonance with the powerful political antagonism of August 2016.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big things can be achieved if all the parties move together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties of the country spoke in one voice about the events and situations in Kashmir.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi.
I hope that in the coming days, all the youth of the country will be filled with the zeal of Olympics.
The whole world will be playing games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons anywhere.
I will surely send you a message to the sportspersons on the Narendra Modi App website.
Come, let us all together try to enhance the dignity and dignity of all our colleagues and appreciate their efforts.
While talking to you about Rio Olympics, a poem will be sent to me by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of the Punjab Central University, interested in poetry.
There will be other poets like this, they will have written such poems, somebody will write again, some will compose music.
I would like to share with you the poem Suraj sent me.
Mr. Angith Karke, a young man, reminded me of the anniversary of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, Mr. Angi was inspired to write down the steps taken by your government to fulfil the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The coming century will be driven by technology.
If someone tries to capture it, then it will appear somewhere far and wide in new styles, and if we have to adapt to technology, then we must be more prepared.
Therefore, we can also adopt research and innovation as the philosophy of technology.
A line of innovation, experimentation and entrepreneurship will increase the chances of employment availability.
If we set up a second generation of innovation, our children will join us.
That is why the Government of India has started Atal Tinkering Abs.
10 lakh will be provided to the schools under this programme and another Rs. 10 lakh for the next five years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
If we can build enough self-sufficient incubation centres, we can create a systematic system for start-ups to conduct experiments for innovation.
The construction and upgradation of new incubation centres is essential.
We have to face a lot of problems in our daily lives.
The mind wishes to heal soon after the sickness, so some antibiotics are eaten.
You'll be free for a while, but you'll have to stop using antibiotics without taking the advice of doctors.
We don't eat antibiotics until the doctor writes it.
We don't have to travel on such a shortcut.
Years will pass through this war, making new medicines and conducting scientific research.
Until then, these diseases will continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we need to be always alert in this regard.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills and the doctor will tell you to eat them in five days.
Eat pills on the same day as the doctor suggests and complete the course.
If there is excessive use of medicine then it will be beneficial to the bacteria .
So it's a big thing to keep the pills that the doctor suggests for a long time.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to comply with the rules and regulations that should be used as per antibiotics.
Our government is committed to defending antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red thread in the area where the antibiotics are being sold today.
My request is that you pay special attention to it.
I would like to add another aspect of health.
I am worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
It cannot be said of what kind of problems are being caused by pregnancy and subsequent anaemia, reproductive infections, high blood pressure and their lives.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months, namely, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
As part of this campaign, every pregnant woman gets free education at government health centres every month on the 9th of every month.
I primarily urge gynaecologists that one day in a month i. e.
I'm sure you'll be part of this.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
There are social discussions in the country and the world about this.
India has been focusing on this thing for centuries.
In the battleground of Kurukshetra, we are discussing the trees of Lord Krishna.
It is also stated in the audience that no medicinal plant species has been extinct.
The tree seeks to triumph over the world like its own plants.
So parents who want their own well-being should grow trees and protect them like cattle.
Whether it is Geeta or Shakracharya or Mountaineering in the Mahabharata, there are some of these ideals that show their own lives in today's generation.
A few days ago, I noticed a daughter from Pune, Sonal, an example.
It touched my mind.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the tree is accomplishing the responsibilities of the colonies across the world and Sonal has taken up a drive to fulfil the wishes of his parents and society.
Kisan Ghandu Mukti Mahatra of Narayanpur village in Kejunar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, in a very inspiring way, had married his patriarch Sonal.
I saw the picture in social media.
I didn't see the groom's procession at the wedding, but I was surprised that only the plants were visible.
It was the scene that touched the heart.
Sonal is an Agricultural graduate and the idea is her own.
You will see how great natural love has been expressed by offering Mavinitai to those who are married.
In other words, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal saga of natural love and I wish Sonal and Mr. Mahatrajee all the best for this innovative endeavour.
It can be transformed into a natural mass of tree plantation.
On 1st July this year, the Maharashtra government had decided to plant around 1. 5 crore trees across the state and to plant three crore trees next year.
It is not simple to plant 25 lakh saplings in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan can understand how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat has a bright legacy of the Forest Festival.
This year, Gujarat has tried to plant crores of trees by offering names like Mao Forest, Ekta Forest and Martyr Forest.
But for me the South African journey was a pilgrimage.
Considering South Africa it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear words of non-violence, love and patience in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoeni settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi was known as Sarvodaya.
I was fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel from the Pieter Maritburg station on the train that Mahatma Gandhi had undertaken, and it was this incident that cooked a seed to make Mahatma Gandhi.
I would also like to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who have been home for their youth, equality and equal opportunity in the society.
Nelson Mandela fought shoulder to shoulder with him and spent 20-22 years with him in prisons, thus filling his youth.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to meet Mr. Ahmad Katharata, Mr. Laloo Cheeba, Mr. George Besos and Ronnie Casirils, a close friend of Nelson Mandela.
Even after such a great penance, I couldn't see the feelings of gaining, accomplishing and being on their faces.
I saw in them the duties of the nature - the symptom of the duties spoken in Geeta - its true form.
There is no mantra of 'equality and equality' for any society and government.
Their thoughts are very natural.
They told me about an incident that sculptures spoke from Bangalore.
I read in an article that a woman was cheated in a fraudulent mail and then she committed suicide.
As a woman, I feel sorry for her family.
I'd like to know your opinion on such cheat fraud mail.
I knew he left everything within a few minutes.
You're sometimes confused too.
They're gonna be so nice that they're gonna steal.
But recently I had a very pleasant experience.
A few students from Aligarh came to me.
Men and girls were very enthusiastic.
She came with a big alba and enjoyed her face.
Artificial painting was done at the station.
Besides, in the rural areas, plastic bottles and oil vessels are collected and they have constructed a Vertical Garden to plant sand and plant saplings.
And on one side of the railway station, this virtual garden has been built in plastic bottles and has given it a new look.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals has come to our country over the years.
Imagine, why don't you give your sister a prize that will protect her life and there will be women cooking in our homes.
There must be a woman who cleanses our house, and she'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of the Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us were born in the post-independence period.
I was the first Prime Minister born in the post-independence period.
May the entire nation be filled with the zeal of the freedom fighters and once again pray for freedom.
Let's all create this environment.
And then the Independence Day celebrations should not be a government programme but a programme for the people of the country.
We have to celebrate ourselves like Diwali.
I wish that you too, in patriotism and inspiration, will do some good work related to it.
Pictures must be sent on the Narendra Modi App.
Creating an atmosphere of its own in the country.
You may wish that those things in your mind should be presented from the Red Fort with the same warmth.
As your representative, as your chief servant, I invite you to share these ideas from the Red Fort.
I do not want to be the Prime Ministers words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is easier for you to deliver things to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for presenting Mann Ki Baat in the local languages at 8 pm.
Several suggestions are helping the work of my government.
Perhaps there's news that it's going to take a week to start the rainy season, and that's why we're more concerned.
Almost in most parts of the country, the heat of summer is getting hot.
Climate change enhances these problems.
The forest cover is underground and trees are cut.
In a way, man destroys nature and destroys himself.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Environmental discussions are taking place around the world.
You will be aware that the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir and Himalayan valleys have been set on fire in the past few days.
In the last few days, I got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of 11 States of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha.
I listened carefully to every country.
Normally, how much was spent on the amount sanctioned by the central government in the past. There was no such minute discussion about this.
The fact that water conservation, environment, drought erosion, animal husbandry and drought-prone areas have shown excellent work for the entire country in a way for the drought-prone areas was also surprising to the authorities of the Government of India.
I told NITI Aayog that good models should be adopted and action should be taken in other states.
In some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, technology has been fully utilized.
I would like to take the successful tests of the States to other areas through NITI Aayog.
Peoples participation on such issues is a major thrust of success.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive planning, by using the appropriate technology, accomplishing the provisions within the stipulated timeframe, I believe that there can be significant changes.
Irrigation is also important.
Their objective is to incorporate 2-3 lakh hectares of land in micro-irrigation every year.
LokSuraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan (LSA) is being implemented in Chhattisgarh.
In Madhya Pradesh, about 22,000 ponds have been added under the BALRAM TALAB Yojana, which is not a small calculation.
They had the objective of water conservation and in some states, projects for water conservation of 10-20 km have been implemented by constructing small mines.
It's a good experience.
I would like to tell you not to lose even one drop of rain water that is available in June, July, August and September.
We have to think about the place for water conservation and how it should be.
God has provided water according to our needs and the nature has fulfilled our needs.
We'll see a lot of water and ignore it and after the rainy season we'll miss the water, how long it will be.
During the last few days, the media was talking about the problems of water conservation.
I am confident that the media will provide guidance for water conservation and spread awareness about water conservation and also participate in the ways to address water scarcity.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
We have to build a transparent India.
Our plans must be carried out in every corner of India without an equal footprint.
Make some changes to our old attitudes.
But today the situation is completely different.
The world views itself as a cashless society.
Electronics enables sending and handling money from all over the world.
Together, we can reverse as a cashless society.
Perhaps, you might have seen that the RPA CARD has been issued along with the Jan Dhan account.
The Credit Debit Card will be used in the coming days.
The pocket doesn't require money, oil or anything.
That is the Bank on Mobile (Bank on Mobile) and National Payment Interface Banking Transformation (PI) which will transform the systems of sustainability.
Your mobile phone will make money transactions easier.
Perhaps, if this is easy, RPA CARDs don't always have to walk along.
Besides, post offices have also been made functional for banking services.
Illegal transactions will stop forever.
The effects of black money will be greatly reduced.
So, my countrymen, I wish we could start this.
Once we start, we can move very easily.
Ten years ago, if any of us thought that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
And that's how we become a society without money.
It would have been better if it hadn't happened without the call.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when the Olympics competition comes or when the game starts, we shake our heads and we shall be far behind the gold medal.
I'll get the silver.
In order to encourage our sportspersons to participate in the Rio Olympics, each one has to enhance their morale and spirit.
Over the past week, we all were anxious about the outcome of elections, particularly the outcome of Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons, encouraging our sportspersons, these things give a lot of spirit and strength to each other.
With a sportsman spirit, India must place its mark in front of the world.
Results of students who have worked hard throughout the year in classes 10-12 are coming together one after another.
I want to tell those who have not succeeded. There is a lot to do in life.
A Mr. Gambhir from Madhya Pradesh...
Shri Gaurav Patel presented to me some of his hardships.
33 of the market was not happy.
Everyone was telling me that I lost 90 percent less than 4 marks.
I don't know what. I felt a burden on my mind.
I read your letter carefully.
I think, perhaps, this pain is not just yours.
Millions, like you, have millions of students, because this is an environment that is congenial.
Can we find satisfaction in everything and lead society towards satisfaction and peace
Your relatives, colleagues and friends, this 89.
Happy Giri Goswami-He has written to me from Jodhpur about the same subject.
He says my neighbours don't accept our results.
I don't remember poetry at all, but some poet I read a long time ago, paintings in the canvas of life.
Some said it would be better if it were yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if they were there instead of putting the paper here.
And if I saw a picture of my pain, I couldn't have had a couple of glasses.
Everyone was talking about the touchup.
Millions of students like you are the same.
You are capable of meeting the needs of the people.
I just want to tell you that you don't lose your balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses their needs.
But remain firm in your mind and try to fill it a bit more comfortable way.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability then the new goal can never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is the foundation of great success.
Satisfaction derived from victory is not a step towards success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of Santoor's musical instrument.
There was a time when folk music was associated with Kashmir valley.
However, Pandit Shivakumar, a man named after him, made it the world's greatest musical instrument.
Shahnai- Our music was in very limited places throughout the world.
Most of them were found in the courts of the Maharaja at its gate.
But when Ustad Bismillakhan put his hand in Shahnah, it turned into an unprecedented instrument.
The cost of not being sick is very low, but the cost of recovering is very high when sickness occurs.
If anyone can help the poor, it is only for cleanliness.
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
There has been a special disagreement with Yoga all over the world and there is respect and faith in it.
Yoga provides strength to lead a balanced life to the stressed world.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes or 30 minutes in his lifestyle.
For this, we inspire on 21st June, Yoga Day.
Sometimes a social environment is the reason for bringing about changes in the life of a person.
I hope you will take the lead wherever you are on June 21.
In your neighbourhood, in your city, in villages, in your school, in your institutions, if necessary, follow it in your office.
Starting from now on, you'll be part of it on June 21.
I will be attending the programme in Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, I have been continuously connecting with you through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
Long ago, I gave you a mobile number, in which you could call Mrs. Mann Ki Baat.
But it has made it easier.
You just need four more times to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you make a missed call in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to you all.
Don't forget the water I told you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time when you and I will be waiting.
This time too many letters, comments, phone calls have been received, so many stories, instructions, inspirations...
People were discussing books on science, technology, innovations, history, culture, business, lifestyle and other subjects.
People urged me to discuss a number of other books.
But I don't have to tell you I can't delay reading too many books.
We have started a regular book corner on the Narendra Modi App and we can discuss and write a new book whenever we read it.
You can propose a name for this book corner.
I would like this book corner to become a vibrant platform for readers and writers.
Several experts have worked hard towards water conservation.
People share knowledge of traditional methods.
For example, from Ranchi in Jharkhand, the zeal for the rural water conservation in the village of Aara Keram in Ormanji Block, just a short while ago, has become an example for everyone.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India, Meghalaya has become a water-forest state.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, very little water is required, but farmers are being given priority for not wasting farming.
I also particularly appreciate the Haryana Government for inspiring farmers to take them out of traditional farming and cultivate a little water.
It's time for the festivals.
Fairs are also held during the festivals.
These fairs can also be used for water conservation.
People from all walks of life visit fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be given in a very good manner, be it exhibitions or street drama, along with the festival, the message of water conservation can be delivered very quietly.
Friends, certain things in life fill us with zeal.
Especially the accomplishments of children and their work gives us a new energy.
So I'd like to talk about some children.
They are Nidhi Byep, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Raot, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Priya Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyesh Ganguly, Hrithik Alamda.
Your mind will be filled with pride and enthusiasm as I'm talking about them.
We all know that the word 'cancer' is the most scary thing in the world.
After winning the game, he won the medal and became a champion.
But it was a rare occasion that they became champions before participating in the competition.
And those champions of life struggle.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
It means that in their lives, the people who fought against cancer participated in competitions such as shooting, chess, swimming, running and football.
Our country has won medals in all these championship tournaments.
Some of these players have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of the success of India in space beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Morocco on cooperation in the field of agriculture and allied sectors.
With regard to space, 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this goal.
The nation was proud to see Chandrayaan 2 coming from Sriharikota to the atmosphere on July 22.
The launch images of Chandrayaan 2 have filled the people with pride, enthusiasm and happiness.
Chandrayaan 2 Mission is special in many ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But always remember that within us we have the ability to survive.
I have great hopes that Chandrayaan will inspire the youth of two countries to move towards the world of science and innovation.
Eventually, science opens the path of development.
We are immortally waiting for September to be landed on the surface of the Moon by Lander Vikram and Rover Knowledge.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with the students of the country, friends and youngsters about a very attractive competition.
I would like to invite the youngsters of the country to a uiz competition, which will be an important issue for the questionnaire related to space curiosity, Indias science mission and science technology.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this quiz and make it an attractive and enjoyable one with your participation.
I specially urge schools, parents and enthusiastic printers and teachers to do their best to make their school successful.
Encourage all schools to join this event.
This will be a historic event in their lives for the winners.
But we have to take part in the questionnaire, get the best mark and win.
Motivate more and more friends.
Dear friends, you must have noticed.
Our Mann Ki Baat has gained momentum from time to time in the Swachhata Abhiyan.
When they showed their skills from the walls of over bridges and schools to huts, people joined them and it became a big movement.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a big role in this regard.
We need to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we must move from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, the other day, I read a very attractive word in MyGov.
This letter belonged to Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lived in the shop in Jammu and Kashmir.
It is a great pleasure to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I participated actively in organising a Back to Village for Community Mobilization programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
This event was held in June.
I think such programmes are required every three months.
There is also a provision for online monitoring of the programme.
I understand from this programme how illiterate and zealous the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
For the first time in this programme, senior officers went directly to the villages and officers who had not seen the villagers, had visited their homes to understand the hurdles in development and to solve the problems faced by them for a week.
How to increase the income of the people
He asked them how the service of the officers would have an impact on the lives of ordinary human beings and the villagers had openly expressed their concerns.
Discussions were held on subjects such as literacy, male ratio, health, waste management, water conservation, electricity, water, girls education, issues of senior citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a part of the government as the officer travelled all day in the village and returned but this time the authorities spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added several things to make this programme even more attractive.
Khelo India has organised sports competitions for children.
Sports Kit, Job Cards of National Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pattern species and SC certificates were distributed there.
Our sister-in-law, brother-in-law, Saddam Administrative, in Kashmir, calls for such programmes and peoples participation, and understands that the strength of progress is beyond the power of bombs and guns.
It is obvious that those who want to spread hatred on the path of development and want to create obstacles cannot achieve their negative goals.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, the winner of the Gyanpeeth Award, has described the glory of the Shravana month in his poetry.
In it, he said - Hodige Madige Agyedu Adaraga land Magna, that is, the bond between rain and water flow is different, and the earth is drowned in its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages throughout India celebrate the audience in their own ways.
In this weather, when we look around, the earth is covered with greenery.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, many people fast regularly and are eagerly waiting for enthusiasm like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
The Raksha Bandhan Festival, a symbol of the love and affection of the brothers and sisters, will be held during this period.
As a matter of Shravanam, this time more than 4 years of devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since July 1, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have paid obeisance to the holy Amarnath cave.
This time, more than 60 days of travel in 2015, more people participated in 28 days.
I congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hard work for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
People who come back from their journey ignore the zeal and zeal of the people of the state.
All this will be very helpful in the future for pilgrimage.
On the other hand, it is high to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start and where to stop Mann Ki Baat.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
It is often felt that India is a land of economic prosperity through festivals.
Festivals are an opportunity for economic security of the poorest of the poor in the society.
You know that I use technology very well... so that I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Sawalesh Warker wrote to me that this season is a tourist season.
Many national and foreign tourists are becoming tourists.
People are celebrating Christmas holidays.
Sometimes they hear disappointing things from different corners of the country.
In the meanwhile, it is the strength of the country that crores of people do good in their own way, just like Turkey.
It creates new opportunities for education and employment every day.
When the entire world was attracted to Yoga and celebrated International Day of Yoga, we believed and became proud of Indias strength.
This imagination is reflected in our minds while witnessing the vast philosophy of India.
Today, the word 'cleanliness' is being heard in the houses.
Peoples participation is on the rise.
And that's a service.
I've also made small efforts on my own.
I can't do it all alone.
My dear youngsters, I had inaugurated the Primary Discussion on Start-up India and Stand-up India at Red Fort on 15th August last year.
Subsequently, the matter was discussed in the Government Departments.
Can India become the Startup Capital
In order to provide a great opportunity to the youth of the states, it was discussed that we can start new start-ups and new innovations, be it in the manufacturing sector or in the services sector or in the agriculture sector.
If you think so, it's wrong.
Youngsters from every corner of India, who are talented, should be given the opportunity.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not be constricted to just a few cities.
It should spread to every corner of India.
I urge the state governments to expand this thing.
On 16th January, I will discuss this with you clearly.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear young friends, January 12th is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekanandan.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is being celebrated as the 12th National Youth Festival.
It will be celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January this year.
A mini-India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, a burst of dreams can be seen.
The power of decisions can be seen.
Can you share your suggestions on this youth festival with me
I think this is the outcome of your initiative.
Thank you a thousand, Mr. Christian.
Are you a person working in this field
That's why you can understand that you've suffered a lot of trouble.
Sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, sometimes the differently abled, so many words.
Every word has its own significance.
This year the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take this.
We are doing Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
It will lead to ease of doing business by developing all types of infrastructure.
Whether it is schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, ramps of railway stations, parking, lifts, brailley scripts, they need innovation to make it easier for them.
Technologies are required, systems are required and sensitivity is required.
Attempts are being made and people's participation is getting closer.
People like it.
Files shouldn't be loaded before that.
In fact, all the plans are for the common people and the middlemen.
In recent days, the Government of India has conducted an investigation on how to benefit the right heirs of the schemes.
In our country, subsidies are provided to gas cylinders.
It was not verified whether the accounts were properly maintained.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this.
The Mission of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is the largest beneficiary bank account in the world through Jan Dhan Account by integrating Aadhaar Card.
I am proud to say that this is the Guinness Book of World Records in the name of the worlds largest successful Director Benefit Transfer Scheme.
On the one hand, Aadhar Card Campine on the other, Jan Dhan Account on the other, and on the other hand, the Central State Governments are working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link them to the bank account through Aadhaar.
Currently, money is directly deposited in the accounts of the workers.
There were complaints about scholarships of students and efforts have been made to resolve them.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiaries' accounts through various schemes.
The Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme covers approximately 35-40 projects.
My dear countrymen, January 26, is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
Two days in the Parliament were kept for a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are conscious of the highest amount of duties during the election time and it is our duty to vote and convince us through advertisements and wall writings.
Why don't we talk about duties and duties in everyday life as in election time
On 26th January, when the country celebrates the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can we organize discussions based on the duties of schools, colleges, villages, cities and organisations
If 125 crore people take one step after another and fulfil their duties, it will be an unrealistic history.
Let's start with the discussions.
You've got a chance to go somewhere.
Festivals have a special significance in social life.
The news of natural calamities continues to come from every corner of the world.
We've never thought or imagined about these calamities.
We are now experiencing that the impact of climate change is increasing at a fast pace.
The central government works shoulder to shoulder with them.
But all around, when such misery is seen, we have to think about the need for change.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a telephone call from Jalandhar in Punjab, from Lakhwinder Singh, from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
"I am delighted to hear the question of Lakhwinder Singh.
The main reason for my happiness is that you are doing organic farming.
Moreover, along with organic farming, you understand the problems of farmers very well.
But it's not right to think it's happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the nature of all Indians and we follow the traditional way of burning crop residue.
First of all, we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does, and we do.
Secondly, he didn't train how to do it.
Well, your concern is correct.
But these aren't real.
The remnants of the crop are valuable.
Secondly, they're burning the surface of the earth.
We can't survive even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, the remnants of the crop burn not only the ruins but also the skin of the mother Earth.
Animals can also be utilized for their food and it saves our land.
Not only that, put the fertilizer from the same land there, which gives double profit.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers who cultivate bananas.
They shared their good experiences.
Earlier they used to cultivate bananas and after harvesting they had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and ten thousand rupees per hectare to change the ruins of the banana.
That's how the ruins of that banana remain until those people who want to change them bring the tractor.
However, some farmers buried these ruins of bananas into pieces of 6-8 inches.
Last time I talked about organ donation in 'Man Ki Baatti'.
He also mentioned the helpline of Chatchcha for organ donation.
Film star Raveena Tandon and other prominent personalities participated in the event.
Organ donation can save many precious lives.
In a way, organ donation provides immortality.
The organ gets a new life when it moves organs from one body to another.
What's greater donation than this
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation for Organ Transplantation was launched on 27th November, 2018 for organ donors to patients waiting for organ transplantation.
I am sure that there will be widespread awakening in every division and in the true sense, the needy will get the best possible help.
Everyone has to move forward for this.
As I have said earlier, December 3 is being celebrated as International Day of Disabilities.
Physically and mentally disabled are the owners of unparalleled will and courage.
I feel sad when they're mocked.
When it's a little difficult, we'll start crying.
When we think about how they live, how slight our pain is.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of dealing with life, their zeal for turning the troubles into capabilities is praiseworthy.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmad.
He is 40 and 42 years old.
He was shot by militants in Kashmir in 1996.
He survived miraculously despite being a victim of militant guns.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed, and one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He's always lost his ability to stand on his own feet, but he won't give up.
Terrorism wounded him not.
How to modify the affiliate tools for Physically Disabled Persons with Disabilities, what arrangements should be made in public places and government offices.
Isn't Javed's life enough to inspire every nook and corner of India
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance and dedication to him on 3rd December.
Due to lack of time, I am only talking about Javed but in every corner of India such motivational lamps are being burnt.
Our country is very big.
There's a lot of government-based things going on here.
More than one experience transforms our vision of government systems throughout our life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people may be working around us like this.
What's more nice to see the sick with love
Are they taking part in the comfort of the society
I congratulate every such worker of India in the name of 'Jamunami'.
Besides making 'e' books more discussed, one of the youngsters should tell the students of 8 or 9 or 10 classes of nearby schools, what is happening here and there.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I extend a warm welcome to you all for nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change.
A friend who guided me to share this impressive experience had sent me an ink to see and experience it.
Well, if they say something they do, there's no other person who's educated.
They are using solar energy to bring light to the poor in their area.
They fought against darkness and made their name invincible.
They built a plant of Ranthal that illuminates the solar energy through a group of women.
They are giving crystals to local residents at a rent of just a hundred rupees per month.
We know what the world's greatest people do about climate change.
Thank you very much for Ee News.
But the beginning is very good.
In a short span of time, 66 lakh people have been covered under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana with an outlay of Rs. 40,000 crore (Rs.
Whether laundry is employed, whether it is a newspaper or a milk provider or any employer will get the real benefit of this.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things coming to me like this.
The other is from Mumbai to Shailesh Bhosla.
Under the Mudra Yojana, Rs. 8.
During the Swachh Bharat Mission, I had said that the scheme is a new entrepreneurship.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in getting it to work.
But many don't know enough about this plan.
How can we build the programme
How should Logo be
But I'm expecting a lot more suggestions.
A lot of basic projects are required.
The memorandum of honour will also be available to the stakeholders.
Moreover, several other prizes have been announced.
My dear brothers, the winter month is beginning.
Together they will be exercising by making a festive atmosphere in their family.
You will be able to recognise how much chaitanya is brave.
Throughout the day, the body will grow more and more.
It's a good weather, it's a good habit.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I was fortunate to be presenting Mann Ki Baat.
A year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can say that this thinking of our ancestors has great strength and truth because I have experienced it.
A lot of subjects began to move from the bottom to the government.
And, the basic principle of governance is that the guidance should come down from the bottom to the top.
Has anyone ever thought that this would be the source of Mann Ki Baat's knowledge
But it happened.
Thus, Mann Ki Baat gave an opportunity to express the strength of the community.
The whole world was surprised that I said one day selfie with daughter.
It was a silent revolution.
Millions of photographs have been sent from every nook and corner of India.
Perhaps the tourism departments of both the Government of India and the State Governments are not imagined that we have so much inheritance.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform and people took up work without even a single rupee for the government.
I am happy to mention Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme earlier in October last year.
Referring to Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi by encouraging and encouraging Khadi products throughout the country.
There was a time when Khadi was called for the nation.
Can't it be khadi for fashion, according to the change of time
I wanted you to buy khadi and do something to the people.
I am glad to say that after that the Khadi sale has almost doubled.
It didn't happen with publicity.
This is not the achievement of lakhs and crores of rupees.
A feeling of manpower, a victory.
Once in Mann Ki Baat, I told you that wood smokes in the house of the poor, the children cry.
They want to get cooking gas cylinders, right
Today, I can say with great pleasure that 30 lakh families in our country have abandoned the LPG subsidy.
I saw a retired school teacher on the channel on the ueen to cancel the widow's subsidies.
It is difficult for the middle class and the lower middle class to give up their subsidy.
But such people have abandoned subsidies.
Isn't this a quiet revolution
We can't see the people's strength.
Outside the framework, what is happening in our government framework, the government is required to incorporate a massive people-skilled, dynamic and determined society.
What else would you like to be happy with this
I thought of a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat this time.
India will not have a place where people do not call.
This is a comfortable experience.
People of all ages have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself, and I liked it.
My team is taking action on the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Maybe it's negativity beyond us.
But my experience is different.
These fifty thousand people said their work in their own way.
How creatively the common man thinks about it, how much wealth it is for the country
Perhaps there's only one or two phone calls from serious complaints.
Over 90 of the energy was a source of joy.
They must've heard the radio.
Pawan Acharya sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has conveyed his message to the people of India: Please urge the people of India to use their best practices for Diwali through this Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will not only benefit the environment but also provide employment opportunities to thousands of craftsmen.
I believe that your emotions like Pawan Acharya will reach every nook and corner of India and propagate it.
I would like to tell the people of the country that if we implement the teachings of Lord Acharya during the upcoming festivals then the light will be laid in their homes but the light will spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two to three hours with the soldiers of the army.
With our maritime conservation forces.
In 1965, the war with Pakistan ended 50 years.
Under this, an exhibition Shauryaanjali was organized at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to make history then it is essential to know and understand the microscopic aspects of history.
History links us to our roots.
If history is lost, the possibilities of history can be fully reflected.
Don't rush like me.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
The kid's right.
And I've heard criticisms of what happened.
I don't feel bad about it, it seems that even in the best Parliament I have seen it, there is a discussion about the cleanliness of India.
On the other hand, Parliament on the other hand, on the other hand, a child of this country, on the other hand, speaks of cleanliness and what a greater good fortune is for one country
This revolution of ideas creates an atmosphere of hatred for filth and there is awareness about cleanliness.
This will force governments to work.
In 2019, on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we Indians should take up this task for the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said
If there is an opportunity to choose between cleanliness and liberty, then I will choose cleanliness first and then freedom.
Gandhiji gave importance to cleanliness more than independence.
Gulshan Arora Mygov from Delhi.
In this regard, we want to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men always inspires us.
Our work is not an assessment of what great men were followers of thought.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is an inspiration for us.
These days there are opportunities to remember many great men.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jayaprakash Narayan on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October, I would like to mention very little.
I am particularly looking forward to the 2nd of October.
Benefits it, give equal importance to the handloom with Khadi.
The weaver brothers are doing a lot of work.
Khadi will be made to the house of a poor widow.
Therefore, this Diwali will definitely be digested and placed in each of you in their homes and bodies.
Look, last time the sales were almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted at something.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family of Subhas Chandra Bose came to see me.
Everything was his son-in-law.
I have had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
My name is Bharagavi Kaaje.
I would like to inform you that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation will increase and in the future, the participation of the younger generation will increase in the elections and governance of the government.
Thank you, Perhaps Perhaps it is a matter of enrollment and voting in the Voters List.
I would like to especially appreciate the Election Commission of India in this regard.
Our Election Commission, which we saw a few years ago, only served as a regulator, but it has changed considerably over the last few years.
It's a very good change, but it's no use working on the Election Commission alone.
Generally, I would like to say that voting first and drinking water on election day.
Kshitij Pandey, a seven-year-old, is studying in 7th grade at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Banaras Hindu University.
I would like to add scientific prominence and interest to our children.
9 years old.
Asked her father, she said she's been saying all this since 5.
I asked, where did you study
So I felt like sharing with you.
We're doing a lot of things on TV that you don't see and don't know through the press.
My time has to be adjusted.
Friends in Akashvani have to wait for half-three hours.
It's a good month's broadcast for the moment.
It was initiated in Germany and it was on the radio that the citizens of India were enlightened about the freedom struggle.
Azad Hind Radio was launched on the Weekly Weekly Bulletin.
He broadcast English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed one year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through the sky.
We'll meet next month at Mann Ki Baatti.
Let your instructions continue.
The government benefits from your suggestions.
It begins to bring about a change.
Your partnership is precious, precious.
Once again, my best wishes.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered a special Malayalam Lecture at Akashwani from the morning of 30th August, 2015, at 11.
My greetings to you, and I have got an opportunity to present my mind to you.
Far away, South Indians celebrate Onam and on this occasion I have also celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan throughout our country.
The Government of India is implementing new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all the gentlemen have adopted these schemes.
I requested our sisters to implement safeguards in the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
Greetings to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, a year ago, I had provided a massive massive scheme of 'Jan Dhan Yojana' to you people.
The banking sector is the mainstay of savings and banks have developed friendly schemes to bring the poorest of the poor.
Today more than one lakh bank friends are operating all over the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You will be happy to hear that over a year, the banking sector has done one lakh and thirty thousand economic awareness camps to connect the poor with the economic system.
I've put these things before you and it's your job to keep this relationship going.
All our accounts must be effective.
In the last few days, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their sounds, their dialogues, i.e. generosity and generosity in the Sufi tradition, contain the rhythms of music.
I am glad that they also invited me to Bodhgaya.
Pandit Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India to visit Bodhgaya.
These scholars from all over the world will get an opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to repeat my heartfelt thoughts.
A long time ago, we had mentioned these topics.
You must have heard of me in Parliament, heard in public meetings, heard of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have nothing to fear.
I don't give any such opportunity to anyone.
We had an Ordinance.
The Ordinance is scheduled to expire tomorrow on 31st August.
I have decided to expire if the term is expired.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, I would like to inform you that this is not just a slogan for us but a mantra for us.
I've got something else to say.
Two days ago, 50 years of war in 1965 was completed.
Whenever you remember the war in 1965, Lal Bahadur used to remember the scientist.
He will also remember his slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
It is natural to remember the Tricolour Flag of India and all the martyrs who have preserved its glory and glory.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 65th War.
And bow down to the heroes.
These moments of history inspire us.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi tradition, I had the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours and hear their suggestions.
India has been exhibiting excellent work in various fields of science and I am very happy.
In fact, our scientists do great things.
How can such research reach the common man
How to use these theories on a practical level
I said in Mann Ki Baat last year that we should lead our students to science.
I realized there were many opportunities and possibilities after this discussion.
I would like to tell my dear young friends something special.
Recently, many guests from all over the world have come to India.
Why not connect our festivals with cleanliness
The rain started well this year.
There is a shortage of food grains, oilseeds and pulses in our country.
The poor need food grains to eat and oil to cook vegetables.
However, this time crops are giving a lot of joy and this year there has been an increase of nearly 50 percent in food grains and 33 percent in oilseeds.
I especially appreciate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, July 26 is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The more the farmer belongs to the land, the more he has relations with the military and the country.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has deported hundreds of enemy soldiers.
It is only because of their collective sacrifices that India is able to speak to the world today.
My hundred and fifty congratulations to our brave soldiers on Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Smt. Suchitraaghavacharya from Chennai has sent a number of suggestions.
I believe you're all sending good instructions.
I would like to explain my point of view.
I don't want to give any advice to anyone, but I don't find any ways to get rid of the state governments, central governments, NGOs or their duties.
Two days ago, I had noticed the sight of a vehicle crash in Delhi and the scooter was on the way after 10 minutes of the accident.
He couldn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me on such topics, you talk about road safety and make the common man aware.
Be it Hoscott Niwasi Akshay of Bangalore, be it Prasannaka Kunje of Mudubidri in Karnataka, people are very much, I don't remember the names of all.
In our country every minute every accident happens every day.
A death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most distressing thing is that nearly one-third of those who die are young people between 15 and 25 years of age and each death holds a whole family.
Another thing that I suddenly remember in my mind is that of a small organisation of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, which touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' means that an excellent brother can give his sister a toilet as a present on the day of Raksha Bandhan.
Motivate all such brothers and sisters to make toilets for their sisters so that mothers and sisters do not have to defecate in the open in the entire district.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village inhabited by workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the work of constructing toilets in the last few months.
Now no one in that village has to defecate in the open.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems of North-Eastern States from Guwahati and also to me on TV.
It has been decided that a seven-day camp will be organised in the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a team of Central Government officials will visit the North Eastern States.
The results of this effort will be in the coming days.
It is very anxious to disappear from science.
In a way, science and technology are the key to development.
Our IAS officers have come to an extensive level to learn a lot of things and have to talk to children in schools or colleges around two or four hours a week, their experiences are their strength.
We have already started it and in the years to come our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children in the village should not be disturbed by studying on exam days.
If small and big industries are to be set up in the villages, it also requires electricity.
If they want to charge mobile today, they want to go to the next village.
Villages should also have access to facilities available in cities.
That is why Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana was started.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to talk about every Indian.
And the months of August and September are our celebrations.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Sitting among the needy, in a calm atmosphere, I heard a lot of things and things from 130 crore people talking to my family.
Sometimes their own things become motivations for the needy.
I merely used my words, but I didn't seem to be missing, it's not you.
An emptiness was felt.
Anyway, it's the last chance.
Mann Ki Baat in a family atmosphere, small and little things.
May this programme continue with the vision of a New India in a way, by creating a new zeal for society and for life change.
Several messages have been received in the past months and people have said that the absence of Mann Ki Baat is complicated.
Sometimes I think it's a journey from my self to Samashti.
This is the journey from me to Nami.
As far as I am concerned, my conversation with you was in a way part of my spiritual journey.
Several people asked me a lot about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
For me, I had the opportunity to meet me.
I somehow went to see me.
Sometimes my thoughts are inspired by the process, and sometimes it is inspired.
When people put forth the challenges facing the nation and society, they also suggest solutions.
People in the letters describe problems, as well as say peace and some suggestions, some imagination, some obvious or indirect.
That is, in a way, I can feel in your words a sign of how peace can be achieved by society alone.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of spirit, strength and strength in the people.
That power and that talent must be united, they must be given a chance, they must be carried out.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people want to join hands in the progress of the country.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how happy my mind is and how much energy I get.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, we can continue Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country, but for the sake of self-reliance, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, no country in the world has voted for democracy, not just for democracy, but for the rest of their rights, powers and requirements.
The country saw such an election in 1977.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and we feel that this number is normal.
However, given the population of the world, it can be seen that more than one country has voted in India except China.
The number of people who voted in 2019 is more than the total population of the United States.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and scale of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the largest democratic election in the world.
You can imagine how much resources and manpower are required to conduct such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and other officers have worked day and night to conduct these elections.
Nearly 3 lakh members of Paramilitary Divisions were responsible for successfully conducting this Mahayana of democracy, and 20 lakh police personnel from different states performed their duties and worked hard.
As a result of their hard work, more people were able to vote this time than before.
Around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines were required to vote in the country.
You can imagine how high the preparations are.
And that's why a voter cannot afford to exercise his right to vote.
A polling station has been set up in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh for only one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the electorate had to travel there for two days.
This is the right recognition of democracy.
India is also the highest polling station in the world.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahore-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
The percentage of votes for women and men was nearly equal in this election.
Another fact that enhances the spirit of connectivity is that this time there are 78 women members who have made history in the Parliament.
I compliment all those associated with the Election Commission and the Returning Programme, and humiliate the alert voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard me say Boke No Book.
I said, "Use books instead of flowers" to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books everywhere.
His stories incorporate all the emotions of India.
While reading the story Nasha (Lahari) written by him, my mind turned to the economic imbalance in the society.
I remembered the days when I was young.
How the whole night's discussions were held on this subject came to mind.
If you don't care what the son of Jamindar can learn from this story of God and the beer of the poor family, it won't be understood when the influence of the bad friends will happen.
A sensitive child's uninterrupted love for his grandmother, a feeling of comfort at his young age.
We can see that a human sensitivity has really reached the glorious moment when we come to Grandma from the 4-5 year old Hamid Festival to buy chapatti from the stove.
Happy farmer Haldu, after losing his crop, won't have to sleep in the field in the cold.
Though these stories are about a hundred years ago, we still feel their relevance.
K.
Muralidhar and Small Tea Shopping P.
Today, the library is a guiding light for all, including tribal children.
The popularity of Gujarat in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Millions of people of all ages participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, I would like to take some time to invite you during the tenure of Google Guru and give some time to books in your day to day affairs.
Please give it a good experience, write about the book reading in the Narendramodi App and let all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking of a challenge not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your opinions on the Narendramodi App and MyGov... and I saw a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
Besides the Lord Gaurai of Balgavi and Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many others have written about water related challenges like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great significance in our culture.
Bless you maternally, and be merciful to us.
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water available through rain throughout the year is stored.
8 per cent.
It's time for this problem to find peace.
With the participation of the people, with the strength of the people, with the capabilities and co-operation and determination of one crore 30 million people, we will find peace in this problem.
The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been constituted in the country with the highest importance of water.
All water related problems can be resolved through this.
A few days ago I decided to do something different.
I wrote letters to villagers across the country.
I wrote that to save water, to store water, and not to waste every rain drop, the people of the village called upon the villagers to sit and think with the villagers.
I am glad that they have done it and have done shramdaan in thousands of Panchayats on the 22nd of this month.
The people of the villages resolved to collect every drop of water.
Today, at Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to the message that the villagers of Lupung Panchayat in Katakmasandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand have given us all: 'My name is Shrimati Kumar Ravidas.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all the village headmen and all the villagers for their enthusiasm.
The people of the village feel that they are now competing to build a temple for water in their village.
As I said, social efforts can bring about positive changes.
None of the contributors can be implemented across the country to deal with the water crisis.
Various efforts are being made in different ways.
But everyone's aim is to keep water and water conservation.
Drinking lines are being upgraded in Punjab.
This effort will help in evading the flood situation.
The construction of tanks in Timaipalli, Telangana has transformed the lives of rural people.
Small ponds built in farmlands in Kabirdham, Rajasthan are making a big difference.
I had read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women had come together to rejuvenate the Nag River.
In collaboration with each other, he also read about the women in Gwali who have made very good efforts to store rain water.
I am sure that it is impossible to make a concerted effort.
When people come together, the water will be guarded.
I say that the water is touching, the touch of that touching bell will create a new life.
A Water Conservation Movement can be organised to protect every drop of water.
In this, we can talk about water related issues and also propagate water conservation practices.
I particularly urge eminent personalities from different walks of life to make a separate campaign for water conservation.
Friends in the field of films, in the field of sports, in the media, individuals associated with social organisations, individuals associated with cultural organisations, those who sing tales and lyrics should lead this mass movement in their own way.
We can awaken society, unite society, join society.
Look, we'll see a change in our sight.
I urge you all to share your knowledge of the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of the revered Bapu, then I would like to visit another house behind Bapu's house where there is a 200-year-old storage, which still has water.
There is an arrangement to stop rainwater.
I always say that those who go to Kirti Mandir must see that storage.
Several water storage systems are available at different locations.
You, too, will be able to share your information with the Hash Tag of Hanshaqti4alShakti
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you one more thing and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, if those who love Yoga as soon as the sun rises in every corner of the world welcome the sun, it is a journey till the sun sets.
The Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and ordinary people from all over the world showed how they had celebrated Yoga in their own country.
The world looked like a happy family.
We all know that we need healthy and sensitive individuals to build a healthy society.
Therefore, propagating Yoga is an important thing related to social service.
Isn't such a service to be accepted and respected
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for Excellence in Promoting and Promoting Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how they have played an important role in propagating Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan is organising various institutes and training courses.
Miss Italy.
We have very inspiring examples.
This is a matter related to Yoga. Can Indians stay behind
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya at Munger was also honoured and they have been dedicated to Yoga for the past decade.
Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established the Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It is a great journey for me to mix with your thoughts - Mann Ki Baat.
Come on, let's sit together, let's share the thoughts.
I can hear what you have in mind, keep it in mind, and understand it.
Sometimes you can try to live with your emotions.
You must have your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come together and share the happiness of Mann Ki Baat and take forward the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Heartiest greetings to fellow citizens on the eve of 53rd Independence Day.
These brave heroes sacrificed their lives for 1. 25 billion Indians.
Our brave sons guarded the night to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the attackers responded in their own language.
You must have seen what action was taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The army is determined to keep terrorists and those who help them out of their roots.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the media was able to see the enthusiastic response of their families, which is instilling enthusiasm throughout the country.
The feelings expressed by the father of the brave Jawan Ratna Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar at this hour of grief are inspiring for all of us.
The nation salutes the unwavering courage of the martyrs of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, Prasanna Sahu's wife Meenaji.
He has sworn to join the CRPF, the only son of his own.
This is what we see in every household of our brave and courageous martyrs.
I would like to tell the youth that the emotions that these families express, their minds, try to understand.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, war memorials are being accomplished in this long period of independence.
It is natural for people to have curiosity and interest in this matter .
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed happiness over the completion of the National War Memorial at Shri Omkar Shetty, from Udai, Karnataka.
I was surprised and painful that there was no National War Memorial in India for so long.
A war memorial was needed to incorporate the valour stories of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I had decided that such a memorial should be required.
I am happy to note that the decision to build a National War Memorial has been completed in such a short time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, crores of natives will hand over this National Military Memorial to our Armed Forces.
The country will make a small effort to repay the debt.
This new memorial has been built in the heart of Delhi, near India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I believe that going to this National Military Memorial for our people is equal to going to a pilgrimage site.
The National Military Memorial symbolizes the gratitude of the nation to the brave soldiers who laid down their lives since independence.
The design of the memorial shows the immense courage of our brave soldiers.
The National Military Memorial has been designed in three circles, depicting the journey from birth to martyrdom of each soldier.
The flame of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the soldier who was martyred.
The second wheel shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
These include the names of the greatest martyrs of the country in golden scripts.
Thereafter, the Raksha Chakra showcases security.
There's a queue of dense trees in this circle.
In October last year, I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was a reflection of the vision that the nation should be grateful to the police, men and women who worked tirelessly for our security.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever they come, they must share the pictures drawn from there in the social media, inspire others, let them be eager to see these monuments in this sacred place.
My dear countrymen, thousands of your letters and suggestions are being received by me through media for Mann Ki Baat.
Unexpectedly on 3rd March, the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
The two personalities belong to a completely different family background that enriched Jharkhands traditions and history.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshadji Tata through Mann Ki Baat is a tribute to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great souls have enhanced the dignity not only of Jharkhand but of the entire nation.
People are grateful for their contribution to the nation.
Do you know why the British adopted such a cowardly path
Because even the British who built such a great empire were afraid of him.
Birsa has shaken the British rule, which used guns and cannons with her traditional arrows and bows.
Birsa has not only fought for British freedom but also for the socio-economic and economic liberty of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
In the dark life of the deprived and the exploited, he illuminated like a sun.
He sacrificed himself at the age of 25 years.
The brave sons of Bharatamba like Birsa Munda are present in every part of the country.
There will not be any corner of India where they have not played their part in this centuries long freedom struggle.
If the personalities like Birsa Munda make us aware of our existence then the personalities like Jamshad ji Tata presented to the country big institutions.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and this should be an industrial hub.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the "Institute of Science" was the result of his vision.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Meetings between Jamshadji Tata and Swami Vivekananda are on board the ship during the voyage to America.
It is said that this discussion was intended to set up the Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Morarji Bhai Desai was on February 29.
As you all know, this day comes only once in four years.
Morarjibai was one of the most disciplined leaders in the country, who owned a simple, peaceful personality.
Morarjibhai was fortunate to be present in the Parliament of Independent India for the most time.
He had to pay for it in his old age.
The government then arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when he won the Janta Party elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The 44th Amendment has enabled the publication of the proceedings in Parliament and Legislatures in the papers.
The amendment provides that certain powers of the Supreme Court were restored and that the fundamental rights enjoyed by Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution shall not be repealed during the Emergency.
It provides for the President to declare an emergency and not extend the duration of the emergency for more than six months once.
In 1975, the murder of democracy by announcing an urgent situation ensured that it would not repeat in the future.
Generation will always remember his great contribution towards maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay my homage to that great leader.
My dear countrymen, this time as every year, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the Padma awards.
They bring a positive change in the lives of others in different ways through their hard work.
It was a great thing to bring a rare painting to the new generation.
Abdul Gafur, the artistic work of the Tree of Life, which I have gifted to former President of the United States of America Barrack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma Awards are Shabir Saiyyad Gomata, Marathwada.
The Tao Porchon-ynch in America is a surprising surprising surprising fact that Lynch is now a major institution for Yoga.
It is a special feature that they have tried to link technology with agriculture and it is important that 12 out of the 10 awardees this year are farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with the agriculture sector, very few people who are directly farming, have come to the list of Padmashrees.
It is a living image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I am going to tell you something heartily, which has been in my mind for the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how it brings about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If you know someone who's filthy to treat without money, tell them about this plan.
This project is for such poor people and my dear countrymen, it is going to start an exam in schools.
In the next few weeks across the country, examinations for various education boards, tenth class and twelfth grade will be started.
I convey my heartfelt best wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to write their exams.
A few days ago, a massive programme of Pariksha Pe Charcha was organised at the Town Hall in Delhi.
In this town hall, I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers in the country and abroad through technology.
In a way, through the radio, I talk to millions of families every month.
I think you're part of my family whenever you talk to you and read your letters and listen to your suggestions on the phone.
It gives me a pleasant feeling.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
I've been telling you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
A very sad news was received by the nation on the 21st of this month.
Dr. Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji passed away at Siddhaganga Monastery in Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Shivakumaraswamy had devoted his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - Kayake Kailas - that is, to perform his duties by working hard, is equal to the place of Lord Shiva in Kailas.
Shivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111 years of life.
He became a scholar in English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He was a social reformer.
He strived throughout his life to provide food, housing, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
All kinds of good for the farmers were his priority.
Siddhganga Monastery used to organize cattle-agricultural fairs regularly.
I was fortunate to have got the blessings of the supreme lord Swami ji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem about the great Swami ji on this occasion.
Once again, I pay my respects to the Mahatma.
My dear countrymen, on 26 January 1950, the Constitution was framed in our country.
Our country in that day, for the Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day in Kenkamema.
But I want to tell you something else.
25th January was the institutional day of Election Commission of India, which is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the massive electoral process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to feel proud of the Election Commission in the light of its conduct.
I must have heard that there is a polling booth for just one voter in the Gir forest of Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its constant efforts to strengthen our democracy.
Appreciate the Election Commission, Security Officers and other officials in all the States, who have been participants in the voting process, have ensured free and neutral elections.
This year there will be Lok Sabha elections in our country.
This will be the first opportunity for the youngsters born in the 21st century to elect their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the country.
They are going to decide the defence of the country.
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter if the age is to be voted.
At the same time, we have to think that it is our duty to vote.
If you have not been able to vote for any reason in life then it will have to be painful.
I'm sorry to see something wrong happening in the country.
Our country is a valiant Vasundhara.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of those great souls.
On January 23, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes of India's freedom.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings have been closed till date.
These closed rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Each stone of this museum is filled with the aroma of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum echoes the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle, inspiring us to go to history.
At this very venue, the British Government had filed a case against the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
I had given you the cap in the museum and the visitors would like to see the cap and draw inspiration from the patriotism.
Anyway, the courage and patriotism of our leaders has to be repeated to the new generation in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Seventy-five years ago, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had raised the Tricolour flag in a tri-color ceremony.
Likewise, raising the Tricolour Flag at Red Fort in October 2018 would also surprise everyone because it is usual to hoist the flag on August 15th.
The 75th Anniversary of Azad Hind Government was just celebrated.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of all Indians through the slogans like Dilli Chalo, Tummy Khun Do, Miam Tumemem Asadi Dunga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom).
Over the years, there has been a need to make files related to Netaji accessible to the public.
I'm glad I could do it.
I remember the day that Netaji's family had come together in PM's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy to learn that several places related to the great people of India have been developed in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur road connecting Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir, it is heartening.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He was also chosen as the Radio to interact with the people and in 1942 Subhash Babu Azad Hind Radio was launched.
I understand that this radio station was broadcast every week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
The Radio Station is being run by M.
R.
Vyas played an important role.
General public liked the programmes that were broadcast on Azad Hind Radio.
These events were a fountainhead for freedom fighters.
View art museum is also built in this Kranti temple .
We have tried to elaborate on Indian art and culture in an attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where more than 450 paintings and other artworks, three centuries old, are kept.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I particularly urge you all to go there and watch the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You must be wondering why I ask for the great works of Gurudev Tagore while talking about art.
Perhaps you have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and as a musician.
He painted the pictures of animals and birds and painted a lot of natural scenery. Besides, he has invented human nature and art in Canvas.
It is worth mentioning that Gurudev had not named many of his writings.
He thought that those who saw his paintings should understand the paintings themselves, so that the message given by him should be known from his own perspective.
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our Mahatma has given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through his thoughts and actions.
Sant Ravidas was such a great soul.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas.
Saint Ravidas ji's Dohas are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his message, he continued to convey the importance of those who worked hard and worked throughout his life.
Several young scientists have contributed to our space programmes in the space programme.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are on the verge of extinction.
Art Sat was launched on 24th January by our students.
A new record of sounding rockets made by students is also being set up in Odisha.
Over the last four years, space missions have been launched for space missions since independence to 2014.
We have established a world record of launching 104 satellites through a single atmosphere.
We will soon be able to ensure the presence of India in the moon through Chandrayaan 2.
Our country uses space technology to protect the lives and property of the people.
Whether it is weather forecasts or railways or road safety, space technologies are getting a lot of help.
Seafarers have been distributed among our brothers and sisters engaged in fishing, which is helpful in financial well-being as well as their safety.
We use space technologies to bring government services to the people and to enable them to function effectively.
Under the Housing for All scheme, nearly 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been tagged.
Moreover, nearly 3. 5 crore earthquakes have been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing power of the country.
Through our competitive satellite launch services, India is now launching satellites not only of developing countries but also of developing countries.
The sky and the stars are always attractive to the children.
Our space programmes offer a great opportunity for children to think and go beyond the limits that were so far considered impossible.
This is also an observation of the stars for our children and a vision to inspire new stars.
In January, at the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune, 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 Games.
This time, in Khelo India, players from all the states have performed well in their own way.
The life of many medal winners is inspiring.
Akash Gorkha Silver Medal for Wrestling and I read that Akash's father, Mr Akash, works as a watchman at a Complex in Pune.
He lived with his family in a parking shed.
Similarly, the captain of the Under 21 Women's Kabaddi team in Maharashtra is Sonali Helvi who lives in Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged Sonali's talent.
It is commonly seen that girls are not encouraged to participate in games like Kabaddi.
But Sonali chose the tombs, showing the best performance.
Abhinav Shah, a 10 year old from Asansol, is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshaya Baswani Kamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we talk about the creation of India, the youth power is the vision of New India.
While narrating these stories of Khelo India, it should be recalled that New India is not only about the contribution of the people of big cities but also the contribution of youngsters, children and young sports experts from small towns and villages and Uras.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of aesthetics that are named after you.
Have you ever heard of the beauty of the toilet competition
Over 50,000 toilets have participated in this strange competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
I urge all the Sarpanches and the villagers to lead this movement in their Panchayat.
You must share the pictures of your clean and beautiful toilets with Mylathar in the social media.
Friends, on 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey to make the country clean and to eradicate defecation in the open.
My little friends, the days of the exam are coming closer.
Anshul Sharma, resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written to MyGov that I would like to talk about exams and exam warriors.
Thank you, Anshul ji, for bringing this matter to mind.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the test season.
While Mann Ki Baat wanted to discuss this issue today, two days later, it is scheduled to interact with students across the country at the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2. 00 AM on 29th January at 11 AM this time along with students, parents and teachers will participate in the discussion.
This time students from other countries are also participating in the event.
In this programme of Exam Pay Church, I will have a lot of discussions with young friends on all aspects related to exams, especially stress free exams.
I will certainly place some suggestions and suggestions in front of you during this event in the town hall.
You must join this programme.
You can see it on time through social media or through Namo App.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the memorial of Bapu.
At 11 PM, the entire country will pay homage to the martyrs.
We must pay homage to each one of us for two minutes, everywhere.
Remember revered Bapu, let us move ahead with a determination to realize his dreams, build a New India, perform his duties as citizens.
We can successfully take this journey of 2019.
Greetings to all of you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
2018 is about to end.
We are enrolling in 2019.
Naturally, in addition to discussing the past year's things, we can also hear the discussions about the years to come.
Whether it is the life of an individual or the life of a society or the life of a nation, everyone has to look back and try to look forward to it as much as possible.
It brings about the benefits of experiences and the confidence to do something new.
What can we contribute to bringing changes in our lives and taking the country and society forward
My best wishes to you all for 2019.
As a result of the determination of the people of the country, the sanitation standards are rising by 95.
For the first time since independence, the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government were raised.
The country won the Champions of the Earth Award, the highest environmental recognition of the United Nations.
Indias efforts in the field of solar energy and climate change have been recognized globally.
International Solar Alliance (ISA), the first convention of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) was held in India.
Our country has had unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Our daughters have enhanced the pride of the country by enhancing the country's pride in the world through the maritime domain.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The country's longest rail-road bridge, the Bogibeel Bridge, was dedicated to the nation, and Sikkim's first and 100th airport in the country was inaugurated in Pakyong.
India was victorious in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India has won many medals in Asian Games.
India has performed well in the Para Asian Games.
As the list of all Indian social efforts begins, our Mann Ki Baat will also be launched in 2019.
All this was possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of India's elevation and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we lost some of our distinguished relatives in this December.
Dr. Jayachandran was known as the cheapest provider of treatment to the poor.
Similarly, Sulagiti, Karnataka died on 25th December.
Sulagiti was a helper in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They have served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, particularly in difficult areas.
There are many inspiring people like Jayachandra and Sulagiti Narasamma.
They dedicated their lives for the betterment of everyone in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to tell you about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some of the party workers told me the other day that some young doctors in the city were treating the poor by camping.
The Heart Lungs Critical Centre is conducting medical camps every month, where free diagnosis and treatment is provided for many diseases.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
These doctors who are selflessly serving must appreciate the spirit of friends.
Today, I can proudly say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been a successful initiative only through social efforts.
A few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people had joined the cleanliness drive.
In this Mahayana for cleanliness, city corporations, service organisations, school-college students and people from all over Jabalpur participated enthusiastically.
I'm thebetterindia.
Whenever I get the chance, I'm gonna go to thebetterindia.com and try to know about such motivational sources.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us to stories that inspire people with distinctive character and life.
com is an attempt to propagate Positivity in the society and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, yourstory. com Young innovators tell us the stories about you and the success of the industrialists.
POSTIVITY can be combined and combined.
I am confident that more and more people will know about our heroes who are bringing about changes in the society.
It's easy to spread negativeness.
But in our society, we have a lot of good work and this is possible only through the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
Hanuman, 12, lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
He worked hard and reminded me of it, he learnt about its various facets, he proved himself to be capable.
I wish all the countrymen a bright future.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Likewise, there was a lot of discussion on the media about Rajini, a 16-year-old boy.
You must have read it too.
Rajni Junior Mahila Wrestling Championship won the Gold Medal.
As soon as Rajini won the medal, the girl went to the nearby milk store and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni Medal was wrapped in a cloth and placed in a bag.
You must be wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The child was honoured by Jasmersing, who sells lassi at a stall in Panipat.
Rajni said that his father had suffered a lot of sacrifices and suffered hardships in bringing the crew to this level.
Jasmer Singh goes to work every morning before Rajan and his brothers wake up.
When he informed his father about his desire to learn Rajni Boxing, he arranged everything possible and encouraged his daughter's excitement.
Rajnik wrestling had to be trained with old gloves, because at that time the financial condition of the family was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni did not get excited, he should have learnt wrestling.
He has won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni in Pune has become the fastest man in the world on a bicycle.
The boy traveled on a bicycle every 159 days, 300 kilometers a day.
The excitement of that child to ride on a bicycle is indeed commendable.
We cannot be inspired by such talent.
Many congratulations to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions such as unity in diversity, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is filled with our festivals.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different but individuals and individuals are equal.
Calendar, Panchagam, based on festivals, is a good example of our close relationship with nature.
This will include festivals throughout the year and knowledge of the planets and stars.
It's decided on which calendar it is supposed to be.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated in many areas based on eclipses.
Gudi Padwa, Chedichand and Ugadi are all celebrated according to the lunar calendar while Tamilnadu Putanth, Vishu, Vaisakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh and Bihu are celebrated on the basis of Sun Calendar.
In many of our festivals, the emotions of watching rivers and water are particularly absorbed.
Chhath festival is related to sunset in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people drown in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have ancient significance and on the other hand, all the festivals give us the lessons of life, the inspiration to live with each other's brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2019 and wish you all the very best to celebrate the upcoming festivals with your full heart.
He must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
In Kumbh, there is a crowd of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from within and outside the country gather together.
The legacy of the Kumbh has been reflected in our great cultural heritage.
Perhaps you will be eagerly waiting for the world famous Kumbh Mela to be celebrated in Prayagraj from January 15 this year.
Saint-Mahatmal has already started reaching the Kumbh Mela.
The fact that UNESCO has joined the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in Manisila as a global significance is very crucial.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed the preparations for the Kumbh.
There the national flags of many countries were raised.
The Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj is expected to reach out to more than 150 countries.
Particularly for the youth, it is a study study study.
I visited Prayagraj a few days ago and saw the preparations for Kumbh taking place with enthusiasm.
This time, there is a lot of importance in sanitation.
There will be cleanliness along with devotion and the message will be distantly distant.
This time devotees can also visit Akshayvat in Sangam after having a pious bath.
This Akshayvad, a symbol of people's faith, had been shut down in the fort for hundreds of years, so devotees could not see even if they wanted to.
This time it's allowed everyone to enter it.
All of you should also participate in the Kumbh Congregation, pictures of different heads must be shared in social media so that more and more people can be motivated to visit the Kumbh.
May the spiritual Kumbh be the magnificent philosophy of Indian vision.
May the Kumbh of Faith be the magnificence of nationalism.
May the Kumbh of Artistics be the greatest Kumbh of creativity.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the Republic Day celebrations have also been celebrated with great enthusiasm in the minds of the people and on that day we recall the great personality of our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
The President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr.
Sirial Ramaphosa will be the Chief Guest in India on Republic Day this year.
Revered Bapu and South Africa enjoyed infinite bonds.
Mohan, the Mahatma was from South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and there was strong opposition to colour discrimination.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy Fams from where the voice of peace and justice echoed throughout the world.
Bapu's perseverance and motivation were his years in prison.
Mandela wrote about Bapu, Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because here he started experimenting with truth.
This is where he showed his determination for justice, where he raised the philosophy of Satyagraha and the methods of fighting.
He saw Bapu as a role model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
Ladies and Gentlemen, a few days ago, on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, DGP conferences were held at Kevadia, where the Statue of Unity is the highest in the world.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life for the unity of the nation.
He was always alive to maintain India's integrity.
Sardar Saheb had thought that the strength of India depended on its diversity.
Recognizing Sardar Sab's feelings, I pay my homage to Sardar Sab for this Award for Unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is a sacred occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For a long time in his life, his workplace was north-eastern and he was shot dead in Namdeth in Maharashtra.
At Janmabhoomi, Patna, Karmabhoomi, North India, at the last moment of life in Namdeh.
In a way, he received his blessings all over India.
Guru Gobind Singh ji became a Guru at the age of 9 after being martyred by Guru Tej Bahadur ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice from Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a calm and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, when Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice for the poor and the weak, saying - (Sawa Lakh se Ladakh se Ladakh i. e.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice and devotion.
He had a supernatural weaponry and science.
As a warrior, Gurumukhi, Brajam, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu and many other languages were known.
I once again bow down to Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are several good events happening in the country but there are no detailed discussions about them.
The Prime Minister said that as a part of the Right India Movement, health travel is being organized across the country.
The event will be held on 27th January.
It is a matter of appreciation that I am trying to spread awareness and wisdom among the people beyond this.
India will be prosperous only when it is clean.
The most important thing for good health is nutritious food.
To begin with this matter.
Lessons on the importance of food must be learned in childhood.
Come, let us move forward to scale new heights for the new accomplishments with new inspiration, enthusiasm and commitment.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, like Monica Jane from Delhi on the Narendra Modi App, the President Government from Burdwan, West Bengal and musician from Nagpur were also asked about the same question.
They say that people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media, mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It happened in 1998.
I was working as an organisational activist of Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
It was May.
It was a little Daba.
I don't understand.
On seeing my reaction, he said, "Sir, listen to the radio."
Recently, Akashvani conducted a survey of Manki Baat.
Some of these Facebook responses are very interesting.
An average of 70 percent of those surveyed are listening to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Many people feel that Mann Ki Baat has evolved positive thinking in the society.
Many people have been encouraged through Mann Ki Baat.
There was wide-ranging discussions on India positive.
I am happy to see that the radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets a mike, millions and millions of people are going to listen, what do you want
They found out that there was no politics in this program.
As soon as Mann Ki Baat was launched, it was decided that there should not be any politics in it, it should not be an accolades of the government and that Modi should not be there.
You were the most inspired by my decision.
Small stories of 130 million people will always exist.
This country will scale new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read the letter, a feeling like that takes a shape in my mind, it gets charmed.
With two words, I share it with you in my experience.
When will a government be able to spread the Selfie with Daughter programme in a small village in Haryana and not only throughout the country but also abroad
All sections of the society, known as celebrities, joined together and awakened the minds of the society and awakened in the new language understood by the present generation.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the government, it's about society.
Manki Baat is about aspirational India.
India's life is not politics, it's not royal.
The life of India is social justice and social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of which is political.
If everything becomes political, it's not a good deal for society.
Sometimes political events and political functionaries suppress other talents in the society and their goals of life.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
People's letters arrive before all the Mann Ki Baats.
My attempt was to see the maximum letters before Mann Ki Baat and read the letters.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As the episode of Mann Ki Baat approaches, I read the ideas and inputs you send during the journey.
So when you read a letter, the ecology of the writer, the emotions of his mind, becomes part of my thoughts.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
I have been leading the life of a devotee in the last 40-45 years, visiting almost every district of the country and spending a lot of time in distant districts of the country.
The instructions of unincorporated letters in Mann Ki Baat are also being addressed in the respective departments.
I would like to thank my friends in Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and social media.
It is because of their efforts that more and more people can reach the Mann Ki Baat.
The Akashvani team is ready to broadcast all episodes in many languages.
Some people recite Mann Ki Baat with the same sentiment in the local language in a corresponding voice of Modi.
Thus, they become Modi for 30 minutes.
I convey my best wishes and thanks to them for their skills and skills.
I also urge you to listen to this program in local languages.
I would like to thank the friends of Mann Ki Baat every month on their channels.
A political person is not happy with the media, he feels that only a very small coverage is available, even if he gets coverage, it is a negative coverage.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'm gonna do it in every family.
It's easier to understand if we don't get in the middle of our own life.
One does not realize that he abandoned his thoughts and accepted and accepted each other's thoughts.
The specialty of today's youth is that they don't do anything that they don't believe in, and if they believe in something they leave everything behind and go after it.
Sometimes, we can hear people discussing the ideological gap with youngsters in families.
In fact, most of the households and youngsters have a limited range of interactions.
Everything says that you do not do that for a long time, whether it is about learning or habits or lifestyle.
I have tried to interact with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I'm trying to learn from them what they do, what they think.
They always have a storehouse of ideas.
They are very dynamic, refreshing and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I seek to provide more connectivity to the problems and problems of the youth.
Sometimes there is a complaint that youngsters are asking more questions.
I mean, it's good for young people to ask questions.
We feel that todays youth are very ambitious and think big things.
It is beneficial to dream big and to make big achievements and eventually it is New India, New India.
Some say the youngsters want to do things at the same time.
I'm asking what's wrong with this.
Many things are done at the same time, because they're talented in multi-tasking.
Youngsters are bringing about great changes in the society, be it social initiatives, start-ups or be it sports or any other region.
Young people who dared to ask questions and dream new.
If we bring the thoughts of the youth to the ground, if we give them an open environment to express them, then there will be progressive changes in the country and they will do so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji of Gurugram has written on MyGov that in this Mann Ki Baat, I should mention the Constitution Day.
Humiliation says that the day is great because we are entering the 70th year of the constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
The Constituent Assembly took two years, 11 months and 17 days to fulfil this historic task.
Imagine that within three years this Mahatma had given us such a comprehensive and expanded constitution.
It is an example of today's time management and productivity that they have built the Constitution at such an unusual pace.
It inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of great talents of the country and all of them were committed to the Constitution that empowered India and empowered the poorest of the poor.
As India completes 60 years of Republic of India in 2010, a spectacular pilgrimage was organised across the elephants in Gujarat.
It was an occasion to remind the youth of enhancing the spirit of constitution and connecting them with various levels of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as Republic of Democracy in 2020 and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us take our Constitutional values forward and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that Indians are different but we must be the nation above all.
India First India is Dr.
It is proposed to celebrate this occasion in all the State Governments and Union Territories.
Thus it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
In addition to this, a train will run on the path of sacred places associated with Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I was reminded of the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb, who was present on this occasion the other day.
The Gurudwara was severely damaged during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
Our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the deeper our journey, the more it makes everyone happy.
Sometimes there's a question in the minds of some people - what did I get with Mann Ki Baat
Your great wishes are my greatest wishes...
Come on, let's go further on this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the youth of the country are ready to run for the unity of the nation and for the unity of the nation.
Now the weather is very comfortable.
I urge all of you to join the Ranifor Unit with enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before the Independence, the worlds most famous international publication The Time Magazine became a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of Lakshadweep published on 27 January 1947.
She gave a picture of India along with the important article, which we do not see today.
It was a picture of India that was scattered in parts.
There were more than 550 countries at that time.
The British had no interest in India.
It is said that in 1920, he did rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad.
It is said how Burdoli gave direction to Satyagraha.
His faith and commitment to the nation were worthy of trusting farmers, workers and industry.
The Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation on 31st October by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the statue is double the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This is the world's tallest, elegant statue.
Every Indian can take pride in the fact that the worlds tallest statue is in Bharatmaan.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the soil, will be decorated with the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Infantry Day.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of soldiers in the name of their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of Hindustan, celebrate Infantry Day
On this day the soldiers of the Indian Army had landed in the soil of Kashmir and waited for the ascendants to sack Kashmir.
This historical event has a direct link with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manekshaw, the great military officer of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manekshaw, who was field marshal, was reminded of that time.
This was the time when military strikes began in October 1947 in Kashmir.
31st October is also a commemorative day of our former Prime Minister, Smt.
Indira Gandhi, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region, Government of India.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like sports and games
Spirit, strangth, skil and stamina are important in the world of sports.
This is the cornerstone of any player's victory.
Recently, two meetings were held in memory.
The first is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
Similarly, there was an opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
Youth Olympics 2018 showcased the best ever performance of our youth.
Out of these, we have won 13 medals and 3 medals in Mix.
This is a story of Indian sports touching new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one thinks.
He lost his father when he was 8.
He lived in an orphanage for the next 8 years.
After leaving the orphanage, DDC cleaned the buses and worked as a waiter in the length and breadth of the length and breadth of Delhi.
Today, Narayana International is winning gold medals for India.
Not only this, India scales the heights of excellence in sports.
India has never won an Olympic Medal in Judo in Senior Lovely or Junior Lovely.
But Tababi Devi won the Judo silver medal in the Youth Olympics and composed history.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old player, lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a worker, the mother sells fish.
Sometimes this child's family had no money to buy anything for food.
In such a scenario, the fortress for the zeal of Tababi Devi never took place.
And then he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories like this.
Each life is a source of inspiration.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the touchstone of New India.
My dear countrymen, in 2017, we successfully organized the FIFA U-17 World Cup.
As a comparatively successful tournament, the entire world appreciated it.
This year, India has had the privilege of hosting a Male Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of every Indian, whatever game he plays, whatever game he wants, there will definitely be a tea for Hawkee.
India has provided great hockey players.
Whenever we talk about World Hockey, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world will know Major Dhyan Chand, Hockey wizard.
Thereafter, Balwinder Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillars have taken a long journey.
Even today, the team is inspiring the new generation of Hockey through the success achieved by Indias players due to their hard work and dedication.
Sports lovers have a good opportunity to watch thrilling games.
Go to Bhubaneswar and enhance the enthusiasm of the Indian team and encourage all the teams.
But in a new era, in a new way, a new generation is coming forward to do these things with a new zeal and new zeal.
Some teach children, some educate the elderly, some are involved in hygiene, some are helping the farmers.
There is no desire to do all this, but dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young Disabled Person learnt to play a wheelchair basketball to assist the basketball team.
This spirit is the work of dedication in the mission mode.
Would an Indian not be proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a very attractive note from Pondicherry Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He has written in MyGov, Please tell us in Mann Ki Baat, how the people of India and their lifestyles and traditions are an excellent example of co-existence with nature.
We need to learn from them what we need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Manesh ji, I congratulate you for putting this issue in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture and today the whole world, especially the West, regards environment protection and seeks new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
People from the Bhila tribes of Central India, particularly from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the Almighty and Arjuna tree.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to protect the environment.
They don't hesitate to sacrifice their lives especially for the protection of trees, but they don't admit that even a tree is damaged.
The glaciers of Arunachal are supposed to have a direct connection with tigers.
They consider them like their own sisters and brothers.
People from the Varli community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and for them the presence of tigers brings prosperity.
The Goud tribes of Middle India have kept fishing in some parts of Kethan river during their fish breeding season.
They see these areas as fish bases and they get plenty of good fishes because of this practice.
Toda, a small densely populated community in the Nilgiri region of South India, is traditionally constructing their homes due to the materials available in the area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living very peacefully and in harmony with each other but if anyone harms their natural resources then they will not hesitate to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that the tribal community was among our first freedom fighters.
Come on, let's express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, we talk about people doing extraordinary things for the society in Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother of Punjab Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
An ordinary teacher farmer was the wedding of Gurubachan Singh.
But an ordinary farmer like Gurubachan Singh told the bride's father that you would be surprised to know that the condition he had put forward is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them to promise me that there will be no fire on the fields.
You can imagine how big social power it has.
This may seem simple, but it tells us how vast his personality is, there are several families in our society that make personal matters socially.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji has set such an example before us.
I read another village in Punjab about the Kalar Majra near Nabha.
The people of Kallar Majra, instead of burning the wine, merge the ground floor with technology.
Greetings to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to the people of Kalar Majra and other places wherever they have made great efforts to keep the atmosphere clean.
You are living a healthy lifestyle as the true heirs of Indian tradition.
Om Dhauh , Shanti , Antariksham , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Visva , Visva , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , in all the three worlds , may there be peace in all the three faces , water , earth , air , air , air , air , air , in medicinal herbs , vegetation
In creatures, in the heart, in me, in you, in the particles of the world, there is peace everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
Obviously, we had nothing to do with that war.
Yet, our soldiers fought valiantly, played a very big role and made great martyrs.
Indian soldiers showed the world that there was no one behind when it came to war.
In the First World War, the world saw the harbinger of destruction.
It is believed that over one crore soldiers and almost as ordinary people gave their lives.
The whole world knew the importance of peace through this.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony is not just a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, there is a need to work in close coordination and in harmony with the world.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the matter of our Northeast region is different.
Its natural beauty is unparalleled and its people are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now known for many good deeds.
The North Eastern Region has grown very well in terms of organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the Future Policy Gold Award 2018 in order to promote sustainable availability.
It means Food and Agricultural Organisation.
The Awards for Best Policy Reforms in the field are equivalent to Oskar in the region.
Moreover, our State of Sikkim has won the award below 51 policies nominated by 25 countries.
Many congratulations to the people of Sikkim on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, October is the end of the month.
We've seen a lot of changes in the weather.
As the climate change changes, the month of November is celebrated as Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayyadhuj and Chhath.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country. This is an opportunity to make a resolve to move forward in a mission mode in your lives.
