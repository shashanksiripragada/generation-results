Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
We are familiar with the lines of the Shlok- Shubham Karoti Kalyanam, Aarogyam Dhansampadaa.
Shatrubudhdhi Vinashaay, Deepajyoti Namostute
What a fine, purposeful message
These days Diwali is celebrated across many countries.
And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour.
In a way, they nurture a microcosm of India at their respective places.
Friends, festival tourism has its own exciting attractions.
Our India, the country of festivals, possesses limitless possibilities in the realm of festival tourism.
It must be our endeavour to ensure that we should welcomingly include people of other states, other countries when we celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, spreading their true spirit.
Here, every state, every region is replete with distinct festivals, generating a lot of interest in people from other countries.
Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting festival tourism in India .
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different this Diwali.
I had urged all of you to celebrate Indias Nari-Shakti, the power and achievement of women, thereby felicitating the Lakshmi of India.
And within no time, there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh from Warangal has written on Namo App-My mother is my strength.
In 1990, when my father expired, the responsibility to raise five sons fell on her shoulders.
Today, all five brothers are doing well in their respective professions.
My mother is God to me.
She is the Lakshmi of India in every sense of the term.
Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her, Major Khushbu Kanwar, daughter of a bus conductor, who has led an all women contingent of Assam Rifles, is the Lakshmi of India.
For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength.
She is proud of her daughters excellent painting ability. She has also secured a good rank in the CLAT exam.
Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92 year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances.
I respectfully salute all the Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well known 17th century poetess Sanchi Honnamma has penned a poem in Kannada that embodies the same thought, the same words pertaining to every Lakshmi of India that we referred to.
One feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself.
You will notice the beauty of word, sentiment and thought in this poem in Kannada: (Penninda permegondanu himavantanu. Penninda broohu perchidanuPenninda janakaraayanu jasuvalendanu) Which means, Himwant, Lord Mount attained fame on account of daughter Parvati, Rishi Brighu on account of his daughter Lakshmi and King Janak because of daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride... their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th of November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakashotsav of Guru Nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world.
The luminescence of Guru Nanak Dev jis influence can be felt not only in India but around the world.
Many of our Sikh brothers and sisters settled in other countries committedly follow Guru Nanak dev jis ideals.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat.
He accorded the highest significance to the spirit of service.
Guru Nank Dev ji firmly believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation.
He stood firm against social ills such as untouchability.
Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world.
He was the widest travelled of those times.
And wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Ji undertook many significant spiritual journeys called Udaasi.
It is said that the revered Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him.
He also travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
During his Yatra to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with.
Gurunanak Jhira Sahib is a famous place in Bidar dedicated to him, cherishing reminiscences of him.
During one Udaasi, Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas.
This forged a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet where people accorded him the status of a Guru.
He is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited.
During one Udaasi, he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He secured a revered place in the hearts of millions who followed his messages with complete devotion, a practice that continues even in the present times.
There in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan, commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Besides Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about Sikh traditions and culture.
On the one hand Sardar Patel, possessed the rare quality of uniting people
on the other, he was able to strike a balance with people who were not in ideological agreement with him.
Sardar Patel used to observe even the minutest of things in-depth assessing and evaluating them simultaneously.
He was a 'Man of Detail' in the true sense of the term.
Along with that, he was also adept at organising skills.
Chalking out plans and devising strategies was his core forte'.
When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of working, we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness in his planning.
In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad, thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate.
He ensured that not a single person would face a problem on account of water.
He contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags.
On the other hand, it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi.
Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly.
He strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, all of us know that as Indias first home minister, Sardar Patel undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states.
Scrutinizing the minutest of events closely was his rare quality.
On the one hand, he concentrated on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other States
on the other, he was watching far flung Lakshadweep intently.
Actually, when we refer to Sardar Patels endeavour, his role in the unification of just a few notable States is discussed.
He played a far more significant role, when it came to a small region such as Lakshadweep too.
When Sardar Patel was informed of this, he wasted no time in initiating stern action.
He urged the Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swamy Mudaliar to immediately undertake a mission with people of Travancore to Lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the Tricolour there.
Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated within no time.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in Indias progress.
It is an attractive tourist destination too.
I hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
It is the tallest statue in the world.
It is double in height compared to the 'Statue of Liberty' located in the US.
The distinction of having the world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride
the head of every Indian is held high.
You will be happy to note that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists visited the 'Statue of Unity'.
This means that an average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of the 'Statue of Unity' every day.
The reverence and devotion for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in their hearts was reflected in the form of homage paid to him.
Besides, at present,it houses many centres of attraction such as Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, and Childrens Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, which are all constantly evolving and providing a fillip to the local economy.
Local people are not only getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience of visiting tourists, many villagers are providing facilities like home stays.
The locals have now started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and I am sure that it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for our nation and the constituent states, as well as for the tourism industry, this 'Statue of Unity' can be a subject of research.
We are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination.
And one after the other, ancillary services like transport, lodging, guides and eco-friendly services are getting inducted by themselves.
A large economy is developing and people are generating facilities as per the requirement of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, which Indian will not be imbued with pride for the fact that recently, Time magazine has included the Statue of Unityin its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the world.
Of course I hope, that all of you will devote some of your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity. But my appeal is, that every Indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 Tourist Destinations of India with family and experience a night stay at whichever place you go to
Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'.
This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
On 31st October, this year too Run for Unity is being organized in consonance with previous years.
It will include people from all walks of life, from every segment of our society.
Running is beneficial for the mind, body and soul.
I hope you will all run on October 31st not only for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison.
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop.
My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony.
But sometimes it so happens, that the efforts of the society and its contribution, get wiped from our collective memory.
Friends, I remember when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi in September 2010.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the same day... the former Prime Minister of our country Smt Indira ji was assasinated.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and sanitation.
Every person, every family, every village wants to narrate their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission, because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore Indians.
The outcome also belongs to 125 crore Indians.
But therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too.
I heard it and I think, I will share it with you too.
Living in the midst of such adverse conditions and challenges is not less than any display of valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but are also running a Swacch Siachen campaign in that arena.
It is so cold there that its near impossible for anything to decompose.
In such a situation, the segregation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself.
We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially during Diwali, it is customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity.
I had once said that we should try to buy local products.
There is no need to go to the tehsil if our need is met in our village.
If it is found in Tehsil, then there is no need to go to the district.
The more we try to buy our local things the 'Gandhi 150' will become a great event in itself.
And I keep insisting that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers, our khadi artisans.
Even during this Diwali, you must have bought quite a few or a lot of things before Diwali. But there are many people who think that if they go shopping after Diwali then may be they could get a good bargain.
So there will be many people, who still have their shopping left.
Hence along with the best of wishes on Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local.
And witness for ourselves, how we can play an important role in making Mahatma Gandhi's dream come alive.
I once again wish you all the very best on this auspicious festival of Diwali.
In Diwali we burst fire crackers of all kinds
But, sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness.
An injury can also occur.
I urge all of you to take utmost care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I extend many felicitations to you.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There must be hardly any Indian who doesnt feel proud of our Armed Forces, our army jawans, our soldiers.
Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the Paraakram Parva, the festival of Valour.
We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism.
At various places in the country, exhibitions have been organised by our Armed Forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens, especially the younger generation, of the might we possess how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens.
A day such as Paraakaram Prava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our Army.
It also inspires us to maintain the unity integrity of the country.
I too participated in a programme held at Jodhpur in the land of the valiant, Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our Nation.
but NOT at the cost of compromising our self-respect and sovereignty of our Nation.
India has always been resolutely committed to peace.
In the two world-wars fought in the 20th century, over a lakh of our soldiers made the Supreme Sacrifice that too in a war where we were not involved in any way.
We have never eyed someone elses territory maliciously.
This in itself was our commitment dedication towards peace.
A few days ago, on the 23rd of September, on the occasion of the centenary of the Battle of Haifa in Israel, we remembered paid tributes to our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad Jodhpur Lancers who had freed Haifa from the clutches of oppressors.
This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel.
For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.
My dear countrymen, the sky offers the rarest of hues.
One of the notable features eagerly awaited by spectators during the Republic Day Parade is the Flypast comprising the magnificent display of the might of our Air Force through their breath taking aerobatic manoeuvres.
We celebrate Air Force Day on the 8th of October.
In 1947, when Pakistani attackers resorted to an unprecedented attack, it was indeed our Air Force which ensured that Indian Soldiers and armaments reached the battlefield promptly.
The Air Force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too.
Who does not know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971
The Air Force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating Kargil from their clutches.
The Air Force defeated the enemy at Tiger Hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock.
Be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management, our country is indebted to our Air Force for the commendable efforts of our Air Warrior.
They have always displayed a unique spirit in times of natural calamities like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires to extend full assistance to our countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened its doors for our daughters of India.
Now, the Air Force is offering the option of Permanent Commission to Women besides the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the Red Fort.
Indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces, our Army not only man-power but woman-power too is contributing equally.
The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy.
You know, Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous, brave soldier.
He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was moving ahead in South Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble.
I had met Tomy earlier too Despite having faced such a tough situation
I pray for Tomys sound health and I am sure that his courage, bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation.
The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis philosophy has inspired the whole world.
Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela derived strength from Gandhijis ideology to be able to fight a long battle to ensure right of equality and dignity for the people.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about another important work of revered Bapu which maximum countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started penning down a few thoughts in the shape of a constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu, put forth his ideas on various subjects like Farmers, villages, securing of labour rights, cleanliness and promoting of education. This is also known as the Gandhi Charter.
Revered Babu was a peoples person.
Getting connected with people or connecting people with him was Bapus special quality, this was in his nature.
Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality.
He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country.
His biggest contribution in the Freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive Jan-Aandolan (Peoples Movement).
During the Freedom Struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at Mahatma Gandhis call.
Bapu gave an inspirational mantra to all of us which is known as Gandhijis Talisman.
In that, Gandhiji had said, I give you one mantra, whenever you are in doubt or whenever your ego gets over your personality, undergo this test
remember the face of the poorest or the weakest person that you have seen, recall his looks and ask your inner self how useful your intended step would be for that person.
Meaning thereby that will your step help millions of those people in getting Swaraj who have an empty stomach and a dissatisfied soul
Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis mantras is very relevant event today.
The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power
I will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind while making any purchases during the 150th Anniversary of Gandhiji, we must make it a point to see that our purchase must benefit one of our countrymen and in that too, one who has put in physical labour, who has invested money, who has applied skill must get some benefit.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person.
In the same way today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution I may be contributing in a big way to help in the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle against poverty by lending strength to the poor.
I feel that this is true patriotism, and a perfect tribute to revered Bapus work.
For example, think of purchasing Khadi and handloom products on special occasions
Two days later, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with respected Bapus birth anniversary.
The very name of Shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us, Indians.
His mild persona always fills every Indian with a sense of pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji had a unique quality in that, he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside.
His slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is the hall mark of his grand personality.
It was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success.
Crores of people got connected with this movement and luckily I also got a chance to participate in the voluntary cleanliness shramdaan with the children of Delhis Ambedkar School.
I went to the school, the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected Baba Saheb himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, the corporate world, all of them offered voluntary cleanliness service on a large scale.
I heartily congratulate all these cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts.
Come on, let us listen to a phone call.
I specially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission or Clean India Mission has become a success story not only in our country but in the whole world and everyone is talking about this movement.
This time India is hosting the biggest Sanitation Convention of the world so far, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Sanitation Ministers from countries across the world and experts on the subject of sanitation will converge and share their experiments and experiences.
This is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited, victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them.
Inspired by his vision, the 'National Human Rights Commission' (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993.
A few days later NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years.
Our most beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us.
In the emblem of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal mantra harking back to Vedic period- "Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah" is inscribed.
NHRC has instilled widespread awareness of human rights and has played an important role in preventing their misuse.
In its journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen.
For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event.
Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
These luminaries have been infusing inspiration in all of us and we offer our heartfelt tributes to them.
Even this year, we should try to organize 'Run for Unity' in our village, town, city or metropolis.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb, because he worked for the unity of our nation throughout his lifetime.
I urge you all that on October 31, through 'Run for Unity', to strengthen our efforts and bind every section of the society as a unified unit. This will be a great tribute to Sardar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, be it Navratri, Durgapuja or Vijayadashmi, I offer all my heartfelt greetings to all of you on account of these holy festivals.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love trust between a brother a sister.
For centuries, this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony.
In the nations history, there are innumerable accounts of this sacred thread, binding together people of distant lands, different religions, around a spindle of trust.
In a few days from now, we shall celebrate the festive occasion of Janmashtami.
The whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants calls of Hathi, Ghoda, Palki, Jai Kanhaiya Lal ki and Govinda-Govinda.
It is indeed an extremely joyous experience to imbue the essence of Bhagwan Krishna revel blissfully.
In other parts of the country, especially Maharashtra, our young friends must be busy with preparations of the Dahi-Handi...
I am extremely thankful to young Chinmayee for touching upon this subject.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Poornima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those actively involved in preserving conserving this glorious heritage, helping it to reach out to the masses.
Every language has its own significance, sanctity.
Sanskrit language literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life.
Science technology, agriculture health, Mathematics Management, economy environment, the entire spectrum has been touched upon. It is said that our Vedas have detailed reference on Mantras, on ways means to counter the challenges of global warming.
You will be pleased to know that even today, residents of village Mattur in Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit as their lingua franca.
You will be astonished to know that Sanskrit is a language that possesses the capacity for infinite word formation with two thousand verb roots, 200 suffixes 22 prefixes
Today, at times, in order to communicate more assertively, we tend to make use of English uotations or even sher-o-shayari-urdu poetry.
But those who are well acquainted with Sanskrit Subhashitas epigrammatic verses, know very well that it is possible to make a crisp, precise statement, using very few words through the usage of subhashitas.
kh Hkosr Thereby meaning, when a guru imparts even an iota of knowledge to the student, there is no material or wealth on the entire earth that the student can make use of, to repay the guru.
Knowledge the guru are incomparable, invaluable, priceless, On the occasion of Teachers Day, we remember the great philosopher, former President of India Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teacher Day across the country.
I felicitate all the teachers in the country on this occasion. I also salute your sense of commitment towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon comes along, bringing a new ray of hope to our toiling farmers.
We just saw how the terrible floods in Kerala have affected human lives.
In todays pressing, hard times, the entire Nation is with Kerala.
Our sympathies are with those families who lost their loved ones.
Loss of lives cannot be compensated, but I assure the grief-stricken families that in this moment of suffering misery, a hundred twenty five crore Indians stand by them, shoulder to shoulder.
I earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon.
I firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the state will see Kerala rise again.
Disasters, unfortunately leave behind a trail of destruction. But one gets to witness facets of humanity, humaneness during disasters.
From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy.
Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing.
Everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in Kerala are going through, in fact sharing their pain.
We know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue relief operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
The Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, every agency has played an exemplary role in the rescue relief operations.
I would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the NDRF daredevils.
At this moment of hardship agony, their service stands out as a shining example.
The capability, commitment controlling situation through rapid decisions of the NDRF have made them a cynosure of every Indians eye, worthy of respect admiration.
I was looking into the suggestions received for Mann Ki Baat. The subject about which most of the people from across the country have written is Our revered Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar and numerous others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking me to speak on various aspects of Ataljis life.
As soon as the people in our country and abroad heard of the demise of Atalji on 16th August, everyone drowned in sadness.
He was a leader who gave up his position as Prime Minister fourteen years ago. In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years.
He was neither seen in the news nor in public life.
The wave of love and faith that spread across the nation is an indicator of his great personality. During these last days, many great aspects of Atalji came up to the fore.
The country will ever remain grateful to Atalji for bringing good governance in the main stream.
But, I just want to touch upon one more facet of Ataljis legendary personality and that is the political culture which Atalji gave to India, his efforts in the direction of bringing about the changes in our political culture, his efforts to mould it into an organized framework and which proved very beneficial for India and a bigger benefit will accrue in days to come. This is certain.
India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in Indias politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15 of the total seats in the state Assembly.
This effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources. This also helped in improving efficiency.
It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity.
Atalji was a true patriot.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
One more freedom- the Indian Flag Code was framed in Ataljis tenure and it came into effect in 2002.
A number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the common man.
You must have noticed how Atalji took bold steps to bring about fundamental reforms, whether in our election process or about the shortcomings concerning the peoples representatives.
whenever a discussion about Parliament is there nowadays, it is about hold-ups, noisy scenes and stalling the proceedings but when something good happens, it is not given much importance.
The monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days back.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon session most productive and this is why Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and in Rajya Sabha fourteen bills were passed.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important bills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SCST commission was long pending for decades.
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers.
This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
An amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
This will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities.
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice towards the woman-power of the country.
Those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of ten years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence.
Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
The Triple Talaq Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha although it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha, I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands by them to provide them social justice.
When we move ahead in the national interest, a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about.
In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach.
Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs.
My dear countrymen The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
Every morning, first of all, people look for newspapers, Television, News and Social Media to check Indian players winning medals.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to those players who are yet to compete.
Indian players are performing exceedingly well in shooting and wrestling but our players are winning medals in those competitions too, in which our performance has not been so good earlier-like WUSHU and ROWING.
These are not just medals but an evidence of the sky high spirits of the Indian players.
Among those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign
so much so, that youngsters of only 15-16 years of age have brought honour to our country by winning medals.
This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work.
We shall celebrate National Sports Day on 29th August and I extend my best wishes to all sport lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary hockey wizard Shri Dhyanchandji.
I request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India.
When India will be fit, only then Indias future will be bright.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well.
But, Brihdeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of Engineering and Architecture can be seen.
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
There have been several engineers in India who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world.
In this lineage of great engineers, we were blessed with a diamond whose work is still a source of wonder for all.
He was Bharat Ratna Dr.
He is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard.
In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their own identity in the world.
When I talk of wonders in the Engineering world, I am reminded of an incident of 2001 when a devastating earth quake hit Kutch in Gujarat.
And she was looking at me and mockingly, saying, Look at my house.
It is called Bhoonga in Kutch.
This house has faced three earthquakes.
And she was saying all this with such a feeling of pride that it made me think that engineers in that era had constructed such structures according to the local situations which kept the common man safe and secured.
While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well. Workshops should be held at different places.
What are the things we need to learn in the changing times
What do we need to teach
The world is facing natural calamities.
What then should be the new form of structural engineering
What courses should be designed to that end
What should be taught to the students
With these feelings, I extend my best wishes to you all.
We shall meet.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
All of you must have watched it on T. V...
in Thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
But destiny had different plans that day.
Barely had they entered deep into the cave that a sudden heavy downpour caused water logging at the inlet of the cave.
No stone was left unturned to trace their where abouts, their well-being and their rescue.
But I feel like viewing the entire sequence of events from another perspective, i.
The government, their parents, family members, media, citizens of that country, each one of them displayed an awe-inspiring sense of peace and patience.
All of them came together as a team to accomplish their mission.
I feel the self-control exercised by each one of them in conduct is worth understanding and emulating.
It is not that the parents were not aggrieved, it is not that the mothers eyes had ceased to be moist.
Their patience, their restraint, in fact the calm composure exercised by the entire society is commendable worth following.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
The whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience, without losing hope, despite the odds against them in the water-logged dark cave.
This proves that when humanity stands together, it creates wonders.
What is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm steady demeanour and the will to strive.
A few days ago, the countrys beloved poet Neeraj Ji left us forever.
it was a combination of hope, faith, a firm resolve and self-confidence.
Every word of Neeraj jis work can instill a lot of strength inspiration in us Indians.
kj ydj gh jgsxkThe darkness shall be dispelledWhether you brew up stormsOr make lightening strikeNow that the lamp has been litThe darkness shall be dispelledMy heartfelt respectful tributes to Neeraj ji.
Usually, the months of July and August are very important for farmers and the youth.
This is the time which is Peak season for colleges.
Like Satyam, Hundreds of thousands of youth leave schools to join colleges.
Whereas February and March get consumed in exams, papers and answers, April May are meant for enjoying vacations, followed by results and thereafter, shaping a course for ones life through career choices.
July is the month when the youth step into a new phase of life, where the focus shifts from questions and veers towards cut-offs.
The attention of students steers from home to hostel.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of ones village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of ones life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
There is no alternative to books, one has to study, yet ones bent of mind should be towards discovering new things.
Old friends are invaluable.
Young people who leave their homes for the sake of studies should discover their new places, know more about the people, language, culture tourism facets related to them.
My best wishes to all the young people about to begin a new innings.
His father earns his daily bread by waste-picking.
I congratulate him on his success.
There are many such instances of students from deprived families who, through sheer determination perseverance overcame all odds and stood out to be beacons of inspiration to others.
Examples such as Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a DTC bus driver, Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied on foothpaths under street lights, Bitiya Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father drives an auto rickshaw, Nagpurs daughter Khushi, whose father is a school bus driver, Karthik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand, whose father is a brick-kiln labourer...
or Gurgaons divyang angel Anushka Panda, who suffers from a hereditary disorder called spinal muscular atrophy... all of them overcame each every obstacle through their firm resolve and eal, attaining success for the world to see.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any commendable incident from any part of the country infuses my heart with energy and inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I happened to glance through a news item, it said- Two youths make Modis dream come true.
On reading further, I came to know how our youngsters put in efforts to transform the lives of the common man by making smart and creative use of technology.
It so happened that once I was interacting with Indian youth in San Jose town of America hailed as a Technology Hub. I had appealed to those young people to think over how could they use their talent to Indias benefit and do something in that direction whenever they found time.
I had made an appeal to change brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two IT Professionals from Rae Bareilly Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my challenge and made a unique attempt.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
This App contains phone directory, News section, events list, health centre and information centre of the village.
This App is very useful for the farmers and the grammar feature of the App and FACT rate among the farmers functions like a market place for their products.
Santoshji, many - many thanks for your phone call.
Actually, Pandharpur Wari is an amazing journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which fell on 23rd July, is celebrated as a day of grand transformation of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy town in Solapur district in Maharashtra.
Wooden foot wear or padukas of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are placed in a palki and pilgrims begin their pilgrimage chanting Vitthal-Vitthal.
Pilgrims go to have a darshan of Vitthal who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor, the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana have deep devotion and respect for Vitthal.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself.
I request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to visit Pandharpur Wari at least once, whenever they get a chance.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Dass, Tukaram are relevant even today in educating the masses.
May they be compositions like Bharud (Hkk:M) or Abhang (vHkax), we get a great message of amity, love and brotherhood.
We get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind-faith through devotion and bhakti.
These were the people who, at times restrained and corrected the society, even showed a mirror and ensured that old evil traditions get eradicated from the society and that people inculcated a culture of compassion, equality and righteousness.
One such great man has been Lok Manya Tilak who has left a very deep impression on the hearts of a large number of Indians.
We remember and pay our homage to Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
He had the courage to show a mirror to the British about their wrong doings.
The British were so afraid of Lok Manya Tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When in October 1916, Lok Manya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people that time gave him a welcome and during that very visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a chance to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad municipal corporation and he immediately selected Victoria Garden as a venue for Lok Manya Tilaks memorial and this was the very Victoria Garden which was named after the British ueen.
The British were naturally not happy with this and the collector continually kept denying permission.
But Sardar Saheb was also Sardar Saheb after all, he was persistent and had remarked that he might have to give up on his post but Lok Manya Tilakjis statue would certainly be built there.
Finally, the statue got built and Sardar Saheb got it unveiled by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929
and the most interesting point is that during that inaugural ceremony revered Bapuji said that with the coming of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a man but it has got the strength on the basis of which, building the statue of Tilakji has become possible.
And my dear countrymen, the speciality about this statue is that this is a rare statue of Tilakji in which he is sitting in a chair and in this Swaraj is our birthright (Swaraj Hamara Janma Sidhha Adhikar Hai) is inscribed right below Tilakjis statue.
And this all happened during the period of British rule.
Tradition of publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav was also initiated with the efforts of Lok Manya Tilakji.
The celebration of Ganesh Utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening, integration, amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them.
Today, you can see Ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities.
All families in that street collectively organize these pandals.
This is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves.
My dear countrymen I had requested last time too and now, while remembering Lokmanya Tilak, I will once again urge all of you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with great enthusiasm and fervour whole heartedly but insist on keeping these celebrations eco-friendly.
Right from Ganesh idol to all decorative material everything ought to be eco friendly and I will appreciate that separate competitions be organized in each city, prizes be awarded for these
on July 23, another son of Mother India was born, who sacrificed his life so that his countrymen could breathe freely in an atomsphere of freedom.
I am talking about none other than Chandrasekhar Azad.
Where will you find a young man in India who will not be inspired listening to these lines -Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mein hai Dekhna hai zor kitna baazu-e-qaatil mein hai(The desire for martyrdom is now in our heartsLet us see the strength in the arms of my executioner) These lines inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and many others.
Azads courage and passion for freedom inspired the youth of the day.
Chandrashekhar Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule.
It was my privilege and good fortune that I had the opportunity of going to Chandrasekhar Azads native village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I bow and pay tributes to the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta Bhyan, another daughter of the country, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
Ekta in her e-mail writes - 'The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he or she holds the tricolor and I am proud that I could do that.
' Ekta, we all are proud of you.
Her achievement is all the more special because she has made the imposing challenges in her life the key to her success.
Daughter Ekta Bhyan in 2003, lost the use of half of her lower body due to road accident, but this daughter did not lose courage and made herself all the more stronger to perform this grand feat.
I salute Ekta Bhyanji, Yogesh athuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji, all of you for your fortitude and passion, and congratulate you
May you go further than these successes, keep on playing and keep on blooming.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is significant because it is filled with historically important dates and festivals, but due to the weather sometimes sickness also enters the house.
I wish all of you best wishes for good health, for this month of August imbued with the spirit of patriotism and for many festivals that have continued over centuries.
We will meet once again for Mann Ki Baat' next time.
Many Many Thanks.
My dear countrymen, Im fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistans first international match and its a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India.
Both teams performed par excellence.
Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghanis words on Twitter tagging me along The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan.
Im also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan.
He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped No, we are not giving him to anyone
This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time.
Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason.
The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world.
What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy
The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs.
This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents skills of our youth.
I felicitate both the teams of India Afghanistan.
My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights.
In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga.
Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women.
On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison.
If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over
Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth.
Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues.
Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.
I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution.
I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum.
More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar
I quote a doha , , The true saint is the one who recognizes understands the sufferings of others.
Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate.
Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion.
, , There will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.
Compassion should be the universal way of life.
In another doha, Kabir has written. , , Compassion leads to righteousness,Greed leads to sin.
Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,", "Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher.
And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab.
In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity.
Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon.
How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is - violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
My dear countrymen Mr.
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on 'Narendra Modi Mobile App' that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr.
Thank you very much, Raman ji.
It feels great to see your interest in India's history.
You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr.
Very few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla.
This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for Indias industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform.
The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision.
Dr.
Mukherjee's dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.
He had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry.
For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal.
It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.
Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjees message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.
My dear countrymen During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call.
I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them.
People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements.
I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people's faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone's life
When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.
In far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers.
Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages.
At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people.
Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their schools tinkering lab.
I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasnt a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me.
I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country's power, the power of New Indias dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India this is what I experienced
There are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite.
In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government's credit.
An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.
I again want to express my gratitude to you all.
We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness.
But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless Samridhi trust with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust.
This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers.
The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust.
A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest.
Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank.
My dear countrymen Its been an year when GST was implemented.
'One Nation, One Tax' was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.
If Ive to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of One Nation One Tax reform, then I credit the states of our nation.
GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states
Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics.
GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world.
The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme.
It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption.
However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement.
This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
I am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six women Commanders was on a voyage.
I want to tell you something about the Naavika Saagar Parikrama.
These six illustrious daughters of India circumnavigated the globe for over more than 250 days on board the INSV Tarini, returning home on the 21st of May.
They traversed a multitude of oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was a first of its kind event in the entire world.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the world that Indias daughters are no less.
Recently, you must have come across quite a few notable happenings pertaining to mountaineers attempting to scale Mount Everest.
On the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the worlds highest peak.
These Ashram School students began training in August, 2017, covering Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh.
These young boys girls had been selected under Mission Shaurya.
True to its name, they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the Everest.
I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart.
Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo to ascend Everest.
And its not that only the young are climbing Everest.
On the 19th of May, Sangeeta Bahal, aged more than 50, scaled the Everest.
This deed is commendable indeed it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment.
I congratulate these daredevils, especially the daughters from the core of my heart.
that a large number of people would come forward to support it.
When I say Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we will inspire the country to come out play.
People are sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media they are tagging each other to spread the challenge.
I believe this is gainful and this kind of a challenge will inspire us to be fit along with others, as well.
My dear countrymen, many a time in Mann Ki Baat, you must have heard me mention a thing or two about sports sportspersons.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
These games used to be a special feature of summer holidays.
Traditional sports and games comprise both varieties...
outdoor and indoor as well.
The unity, intrinsic to our countrys diversity can be witnessed in these games.
A single game is known by distinct names at different places.
It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
Known as Chowkabara in Karnataka, Attoo in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakaali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Daayaam and Thaayaam in Tamilnadu, Changaa Po in Rajasthan, it had innumerable names.
One realizes after playing, despite not knowing the language of a particular state, Oh
This is a game that is played across villages and cities.
It is also known by different names.
In Andhra Pradesh it is called Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Odisha its called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra, Vittidaaloo.
Traditional sports and games are structured in such a manner that along with physical ability, they enhance our logical thinking, concentration, alertness and energy levels.
Games are not just games they teach us values in life, such as, setting targets, building up determination, developing team spirit and fostering mutual co-operation.
I recently noticed in a training programme in Business Management, our traditional sports and games being used for improving overall personality development and interpersonal skills.
At the same time, we also come to know about our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about our society, environment and other spheres.
It is crucial that today schools, neighbourhoods and youth congregations should come forward and promote these games.
Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games.
The Videos of these games can be shot, outlining the way to play these games along with the mandatory rules and regulations.
Animation films can also be made so that our young generations for whom these games played in our streets are something to marvel about, can see, play for themselves and thus bloom.
This time the theme is 'Beat Plastic Pollution'.
I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health.
Let us all visit the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.
There was also loss of life and property.
These calamities are basically the result of the change in weather patterns.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life.
Today when India speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, let all of us give it a good thought as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener
How can we progress in this direction What innovative things can we do
The rainy season is fast approaching
we can set a target of achieving record plantation of trees this time and not only plant trees but also nurture and maintain the saplings till they grow.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, you do remember the 21st of June now
not only you and I, June 21st remains a part of the entire worlds collective consciousness.
The 21st of June has been mandated and is celebrated as the International Yoga Day in the entire world and people start preparing for it months in advance.
The news being received these days is that there are preparations afoot in the whole world to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.
The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father.
The practice of yoga leads to germination of a sense of forgiveness in the same manner as a mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartahari has said that with regular yogic exercise, truth becomes our child, mercy becomes our sister, self restraint our brother, earth turns in to our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger.
When so many attributes become one's partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today is the 27th of May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I render my pranam to Pandit ji.
This was the very month, the month of May 1857, when Indians had displayed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice.
It is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers mutiny for a very long time.
In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First War of Independence.
Savarkar along with his band of brave hearts celebrated the 50th anniversary of the First War of Independence with great fanfare at India house in London.
he was a worshipper of both weapons or shashtra and Knowledge or shaashtras.
Generally Veer Savarkar is renowned for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj.
But besides these sterling qualities, he was also a striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
Savarkar marched along with both poetry and revolution.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a courageous revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living - today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished.
I wish all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future.
They have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved despite all odds And this is not only about Sikar, but in every corner of India, you will witness something akin to this.
If you observe in your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues.
These discussions are also political and social in nature, can be about movies, sports and sportspersons or can focus even on the problems of the country any problem with probable solutions are discussed at length but often the problems and their solutions remain limited to such animated discussions only.
He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school.
He has banished the darkness from their lives.
Who amongst us does not know the Vedic shloka 'Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya' However, it has been put into practice by D.
His life is an inspiration to us, our society and the whole country.
Your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings.
There must be innumerable incidents.
Come, let us take positivity forward.
The month of June is so hot that people anxiously wait for the rains, gazing towards the sky for the clouds to appear.
People will wait for the moon in a few days from now onwards.
Witnessing the moon means that the festival of Eid can be celebrated.
After an entire month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations.
I hope and believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with gaiety and fervor and on this occasion children will specially get a grand Eidi.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Heartiest felicitations to all of you.
My dear countrymen, many thanks to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia.
71 countries, including India, participated therein.
With an event of such scale magnitude, which saw the participation of thousands of sportspersons from myriad corners of the world, can you imagine the mood that must have pervaded the atmosphere there
Our sportspersons too lived up to the countrymens expectations and displayed stellar performances, winning one medal after another.
Shooting or Wrestling, Table Tennis or Badminton, it was a record performance for India.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze, India bagged a tally of around 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian swell with pride.
After the conclusion of a match, representing India, when the athletes draped in the tricolor rise, displaying their medals, the notes of the National Anthem being played evoke a sense of joy and fulfillment, glory and honour.
But I want to share with you what I heard from these heroes.
Indias performance in the Commonwealth Games was par excellence. At the same time, it was special.
Manika Batra won a medal in each of the events that she competed in.
She is the first Indian woman to win a gold in the individual table tennis category too.
15 year old Indian shooter Anish Bhanwala became the youngest sportsperson to win a gold for India.
Sachin Chowdhary is the sole Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
This edition of the games was special on one more count- a majority of the medalists was women athletes.
In squash, boxing, weightlifting and shooting the performance of women turned out to be par excellence.
The final contest in Badminton took place between two Indian Shuttlers, Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
The whole country watched it with abated breath.
Athletes who participated in these games hail from various parts of the country, even from smaller towns.
They have reached this pinnacle, crossing a great deal of hurdles and hardships.
Today, the positions they have secured for themselves, the targets they have achieved, owes a lot to the efforts contribution of their parents, guardians, coaches, support staff, schools, teachers, the atmosphere provided by their Schools, during this journey in their lives.
Even their friends have contributed by boosting their morale under all circumstances.
I also congratulate them along with the sportspersons, my good wishes to them.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Rooma Devnath writes, I truly feel happy healthy through my Morning Walks.
She further adds, For me, fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
Devnathji, indeed, happiness is fitness, and theres no doubt about it.
Dhawal Prajapati, sharing a photograph of himself trekking, has written
For me, travelling trekking is Fit India.
It was heartening to see many eminent personalities encouraging our youth in interesting ways for Fit India.
Cine artiste Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Even I have gone through it, you too should view it- it shows him exercising with wooden beads.
He has mentioned that this exercise benefits muscles of the back and the stomach, to a great extent.
I feel movements like these are beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You too must be busy with preparations...
the significance, the merit of 21st June, International Yog Day has been accepted welcomed globally.
Nowadays, the benefits of yog in ones holistic physical mental development does not need to be told... neither in India nor elsewhere in the world.
You must have viewed an animated video depicting me, that has been widely circulated.
I congratulate those from the field of animation for highlighting nuances, just the way a teacher does. You too will benefit from it.
My young friends, you now must be out of the tread mill of exams, exams more exams
I would like to talk to you today, to invite you on a new task.
Ive seen a lot of young people these days, spending time in learning new things.
One gets an opportunity to experience life anew, away from closeted walls, away from paper pen and computers.
Dear young friends, today I urge you to undergo a special internship. Three Ministries of the Government of India
And let me tell you, the best out of the best interns who have strived in schools colleges with excellent work will be rewarded with recognition at the national level.
Once again, I invite students young people, boys girls to avail of the benefits of the internship.
I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward.
I too am eager to know more about your efforts.
Do send in your learning experience, do post your stories, photos and videos.
I try to watch Good News India programme on Doordarshan whenever I get a chance and I would appeal to my countrymen that we all should also watch this Good News India programme wherein we get to know as to how many people in various parts of our country are doing many good things and that such good things are happening.
Recently, I saw that they were presenting the story of some youth from Delhi who are selflessly working in a dedicated manner to help in educating the poor children. This group of youngsters has started a big campaign in Delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers.
Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission.
Starting with just 15 children from the slums near Geeta Colony in New Delhi it is now being run at 12 places and two thousand children have been brought under its fold.
Young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation.
Dear brothers and sisters, in this very way, some farmers from hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With their collective efforts, they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, main crops sown are Mandwa, Chaulai, Corn or Barley.
This being a hilly area, the farmers did not get a fair price of their produce. But, the farmers in Kapkot tehsil decided to come out of this situation and adopted a value- addition process and changed the loss incurring equation into a profit-earning one.
What they did was that they started production of biscuits from their agricultural produce and sold those biscuits directly in the market.
These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there.
Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district.
With the hard work of these farmers, the annual turnover of the society has gone up from 10 to 15 lakh rupees and with more than 900 families getting employment here, people have stopped migrating to other places.
My dear countrymen, we often hear that in, times to come, the world will face a war because of water.
Everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water
And, water conservation is not a new topic for us
it is neither a part of the academic curriculum nor a part of our languages.
Our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together.
They gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water.
They found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water.
Those of you who might be getting a chance to visit Tamilnadu might have noticed that in some temples in the state, there are carvings on stone depicting irrigation system, water conservation methods and drought management.
May it be Mannarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai you will get to see massive stone inscriptions to this effect.
Several baodis (stepwells) are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished.
If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi.
This is one of the biggest and the most beautiful baodis of India and the point to be noted is that this is situated in a water-scarce area.
April, May, June and July is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance, we can reap a rich harvest.
Budget under MNREGA is also utilized for this water conservation activity.
During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management.
An average of 32,000 crore rupees have been spent besides the MNREGA budget each year on water conservation and water management.
If we talk of 2017-18, 55 percent of the total outlay of Rupees 64 thousand crores, which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores, has been spent on works like water conservation.
In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures.
They succeeded in reviving the dried out Sasur Khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40-45 villages of the area.
I emphasis that once again April, May, June and July are before us and we must also take up some responsibility for water harvesting and water conservation, we should also chalk out some schemes, we should also do and show something.
My dear countrymen When Mann Ki Baat approaches I receive messages, letters and phone calls from all sides.
Aayan Kumar Banerjee from Devi Tola village of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal in his comment on My Gov has written We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people are not aware of the Nobel Laureate Rabindra Naths philosophy of living peacefully, aesthetically and with integrity.
Kindly discuss this point in Mann Ki Baat programme so that more and more people may get to know about this.
Rabindra Nath was a personality full of talent, a multi directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt.
He has written in Gitanjali He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.
The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others.
When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad-peace be upon him- and his message.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life.
Once a person asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): "Which is the best thing in Islam
" The Prophet Saab said, "feeding a poor and needy and meeting everyone cordially, whether you know him or not
"Prophet Mohammad Sahib (peace be upon him) believed in twin principles of knowledge and compassion.
He did not possess an iota of ego regarding himself.
He preached that knowledge alone defeats ego.
Prophet Mohammad Sahib(peace be upon him) believed that if you possessed anything more than your requirement, then donate it to the needy, thus donation or giving alms is important during Ramzan.
People donate generously to the needy during this holy month.
Prophet Muhammad Sahib believed that a person is rich because of his inherent spirituality, and not materialistic wealth.
My dear countrymen Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddhas teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values, which are most desired in the world today.
Baba Saheb Dr.
Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb had said My Social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Baba Saheb strengthened the oppressed, exploited, deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the Constitution of India.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this.
This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people.
We have inherited the wisdom of Lord Buddha throughout Asia as part of our legacy.
It forges a link between us and many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar where Buddhist traditions and his preaching are a part of their origins. And this is the very reason that we are developing Infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which is going to connect Southeast Asia with the important Buddhist sites of India.
I seek benediction from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, as we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of laughing Buddha, it is said that laughing Buddha brings one good fortune, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defense history.
Now you will be wondering what is the connection between smiling Buddha and India's military might
You must remember, 20 years ago today, on 11th May 1998, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said while addressing the nation and his words filled the whole country with pride, courage and elation.
The Indian diaspora was infused with new confidence.
That day also was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Indias western end a nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
It has been 20 years since Pokhranand this test was done on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology.
We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important.
It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels.
On that day, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra - "Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Vigyan.
Now that when we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Pokhran test conducted on May 11, 1998, I ask the younger generations of our nation to imbibe the mantra of 'Jai-Vigyan' given by Atalji for enhancing the might and the power of India, to build a modern India, a powerful India and a self-reliant India.
Synergize your energy with the strength of India.
Witnessing the journey that Atal ji started, we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead.
My dear countrymen, looking forward to our conversation when we will meet for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
A while ago, when distinguished dignitaries of all ASEAN Countries were here on the 26th of January, they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries.
And its a matter of immense pride that a majority of these countries presented the Ramayan in front of us.
This signifies that Ram Ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact, not just in India, but in that part of the world too.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Alongwith being IT professional, your love for Sanskrit has gladdened me.
I have instructed the concerned department to convey to you efforts being made in this direction.
I shall also request listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are engaged in the field of Sanskrit, to ponder over ways means to take Komaljis suggestion forward.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji of Village Baraakar, District Nalanda, Bihar I read your comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have raised on the depleting ground water levels is indeed of great importance.
and that will be conceivable only when we begin feeling concerned about every living being on this land.
You have urged one and all to retain and keep aside some water for birds animals, during summer time.
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your sentiments to our listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
Recently, the President of France paid a visit to Kashi, Varanasi based Shriman Prashant Kumar has written that glimpses of that visit were extremely touching, appealing left a deep impact.
And it is his heart felt desire to see all those photos videos being shared on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
Let me tell Anagha, Jayesh other children that these letters enliven me up after a hard days work.
Now, if I start including all those phone calls, comments, whatever I could read or hear, many of which touched my heart
They have shared their vacation plans. Theyve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds animals.
Our farmer brothers sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
uite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
During the festival season, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are focused upon.
When I get to read in your letters how a rickshaw puller from Karimgunj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built nine schools for underprivileged children, I witness firsthand the indomitable will-power this country possesses.
When I heard the story of Kanpur based Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary, of how he visits the underprivileged on footpaths and offers free medicines to them, it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country.
Thirteen years ago, on account of a delay in medical treatment, a Cab driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar lost his sister.
Innumerable shining examples like these are the hallmark of our country.
Today the whole world has changed the way it looks at India.
the reason behind it is the Purusharth, the resolute yet selfless inner strength of such illustrious sons daughters of Mother India.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
That is why a large number of letters on agriculture have been received.
This time, I requisitioned and viewed videos of discussions with our farmers on DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and I feel that each farmer should get connected to this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan, view it and adopt those practices in his her own farm.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nations economy and also for the common mans life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lal ji had talked of creating a mass awakening on an extensive scale about the necessary measures to ensure a better income for our farmers and provide better irrigation facilities and to increase food and milk production.
Chaudhari Charan Singh in his speech in 1979 had urged our farmers to use new technology and to adopt new innovations and underlined their vital significance.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
They have showed that if once the targets are set, spirits are high and with a strong resolve, the set targets can most certainly be attained.
Today, the farmers have technology to help them while they work hard in their fields.
This has provided a big boost to our agro- producers.
I have received a number of letters in which a large number of farmers have written about MSP and they wanted that I should talk to them at length over this.
Brothers and sisters, in this years budget a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.
It has been decided that the MSP of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost.
Moreover, an extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
Twenty- two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform- so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce.
In other words, such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin.
How should the country celebrate it
I request you all to share your opinions and suggestions with everyone via MyGov.
What should be the logo for Gandhi 150
Earlier, every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the Health Ministry alone.
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness.
Also, extensive work is going on to set up Health Wellness Centres across the country.
Yoga has attained worldwide recognition as a measure of preventive health care.
Yoga is a guarantee of both fitness and wellness.
It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that Yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.
Less than a hundred days are now left for the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
On the previous three International Yoga Days, people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm.
This time too, we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family, friends and all others from now itself to do yoga.
Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways.
Usually, the countrys Television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on Yoga the whole year.
Can we, beginning now, till the Yoga Day, devise a campaign to spread awareness on Yoga
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
But yes, I surely am a Yoga practitioner and yet some people, through their creativity, have made me a Yoga teacher as well and 3-D animated videos of my yoga practice sessions have been prepared.
I will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together.
Efforts are being extensively undertaken to make health care accessible and affordable, make it easily accessible and affordable for the common man.
Presently, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than eight hundred medicines are being made available there at an affordable price.
More such centres are being opened.
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
Knee implants cost has also been regulated and reduced by 50 to 70.
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana , the Government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide 5 lakh repees for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year.
In the present 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68 thousand.
One new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness.
All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
According to him the industry was an effective medium by which jobs could be made available to the poorest of the poor and the poorer.
Today, the campaign of Make in India is progressing successfully in consonance with Dr.
Ambedkarjis dream of India as an industrial super power-that vision of his has become our inspiration today.
Today India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment or FDI in the world, is flowing to India.
The whole world is looking at India as a hub for investment innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
He did not want anybody to languish in poverty forever.
He also believed that poverty cannot be ameliorated by mere distribution of capital among the impoverished.
Today our monetary policy, Start Up India, Stand Up India initiative have become seedbed for our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
He stressed the utilization of water for the development of the nation The genesis of different river valley authorities, different water related commissions - all these were possible due to the vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today there are landmark efforts, being embarked upon for waterways and ports in our country.
New seaports are being constructed on a number of seaways of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
In the era of 40s, while most of the discussions were centred around the Second World War, the looming Cold war and the partition it was during those times Dr. Ambedkar had laid the foundation of Team India's spirit in a way.
He had talked about the importance of federalism, federal system and stressed on Center and states working together for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted in all aspects of governance the mantra of co-operative federalism and going a step further, we have adopted competitive cooperative federalism but most importantly, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me, who belong to backward classes.
But, the picture of New India is altogether different. It is an India which is Ambedkars India, of the poor and the backward.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar from April 14 to May 5 Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan, is being organized.
Under the aegis of this campaign, separate programmes on village development, poverty amelioration and social justice will be held throughout India.
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
My dear countrymen, a spectrum of many festivals would dawn upon us in the next few days- Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and the Baisakhi.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir's birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
I extend felicitations to all on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
Once again, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of the festivals coming our way.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
All of us have seen that the sea appears blue, but we know from routine life experiences that water has no colour at all.
Have we ever thought why water acquires colour in rivers and seas
The same thought occurred to a young man in the 1920s.
The same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about Science, the first name that strikes us is that of Bharat Ratna Sir C.
Raman. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
One of his discoveries is famous as the Raman Effect.
We celebrate the 28th of February as National Science Day since on this very day, he is said to have discovered the phenomenon of light scattering, for which the Nobel Prize was conferred upon him.
Right from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently I got an opportunity to take part in a programme in Mumbai the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
Artificial Intelligence aids in making robots, Bots and other machines meant for specific tasks.
Through self learning, machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level.
This technology can be harnessed to better the lives of the underprivileged, the marginalized and the needy.
In that programme on Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to deliberate on how Artificial Intelligence could help us make life easier for our divyang brothers sisters.
Can we make better predictions of natural disasters using Artificial Intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence be used as tool to simplify the outreach of health services and modernize medical treatment
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of I create.
There a young person referred to developing a digital instrument that converts the written word into voice. This is to aid those who are incapable of speech to converse normally like any other person.
I feel we can harness Artificial Intelligence in many such fields.
Science and Technology are value neutral.
They dont possess any value in themselves.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments.
Once, on being asked about it, he quipped, I have devised ten thousand ways of how NOT to make a light bulb. What I mean to say is, Edison transformed even his failures into his own strength.
Coincidentally, I am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them and questioned subjugation.
Thus, as a great sage, he questioned every facet of life. Extracting answers, he showed the right path to humanity.
The relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the truth is very important.
I congratulate our scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, safety in the times of crises, disasters are topics on which many messages keep coming in- people keep writing to me.
In a comment posted on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Shriman Ravindra Singh from Pune has referred to occupational safety.
He writes that in our country, safety standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters.
Leave aside natural disasters most of the mishaps are a consequence of some mistake or the other on our part.
If we stay alert, abide by the prescribed rules regulations, we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming society.
There are times when we come across many slogans on safety at the work place but none following their letter and spirit.
I urge the fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them.
This will have a dual benefit the fire brigade will undergo an exercise in readiness and the new generation will get lessons in alertness.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, NDMA is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with disasters in the country.
In Districts prone to floods and cyclones, an initiative names Aapada Mitra has been launched for training Volunteers.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave.
After that, NDMA organized workshops on heat wave management as part of a campaign to raise awareness in people.
Mass participation led to good results.
In 2017, the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
I laud the role played by innumerable individuals, citizens who immediately embark upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes.
And there are numerous such unnamed, unsung heroes.
Our Fire Rescue services, National Disaster Response Forces Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces... these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in distress, often risking their own lives.
India has made a pioneering effort BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan Nepal a joint disaster management exercise involving these countries was undertaken.
We must have heard it hundreds of times.
But today if one of us is taken inside an aircraft and asked about the location of equipments, say life jackets, and how to use them, I can say for sure that none of us will be able to give the right answer.
If all of us become conscious and aware of our own safety, the essence of safety of society will be inbuilt.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning waste to wealth and waste to energy through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
An effort was initiated which was named GOBAR-Dhan - Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
The aim of this GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into Compost and Bio Gas.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other Bio-waste to produce energy.
But India was lacking full capacity utilization.
Under the Swachch Bharat Mission (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction.
A target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste to produce Bio gas based energy.
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our farmer brothers sisters in rural India will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income.
Biogas generation will increase self-reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income.
There will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created for better implementation of 'Gobar Dhan Yojana', it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step forward, and through creation of self-help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity.
I invite you to become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs, to become a part of the initiative to convert waste in your village to wealth and by converting dung into Gobar dhan.
But in a unique endeavor in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first 'Trash Mahotsav' was organized.
The objective behind this festival sponsored by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to generate awareness about cleanliness and the methods using which city's waste can be creatively used and inculcate awareness about various ways to recycle the garbage.
For the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and administration.
Every year on March 8, 'International Women's Day' is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
On this day, women are also felicitated with 'Nari Shakti Puraskar' who have performed exemplary tasks in different sectors in the past.
Today the country is moving forward from the path of Women development to women-led development.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Hed said 'The idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence' - This idea of Swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the contemplation of woman power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic life, it is our fundamental duty.
Today our woman power has shown inner fortitude and self-confidence, has made herself self-reliant.
Not only has she advanced herself but has carried forward the country and society to newer heights.
After all, our dream of 'New India' is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a gentleman had given me a very sound proposition.
He had suggested that on 8th March myriad events herald 'Women's Day' Why cannot we felicitate mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every Indian village or city,
5 million women in Jharkhand and this figure is not a small one organized a hygiene campaign for an entire month
Under the auspices of this campaign starting from January 26, 2018, these women constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days and made a record of sorts.
There were about one lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water carriers, 10 thousand female cleaners and 50 thousand women masons were involved in this campaign.
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
It is a very important tourist destination.
I was surprised to know that despite being such a prominent center of tourism its close proximity from Mumbai, electricity hadnt reached Elephanta after so many years of independence.
For 70 years, the lives of the denizens of three villages of the Elephanta Island, Rajbunder, Morbandar and Centabandar, were engulfed by darkness, which has got dispelled now and there is brightness in their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted due to electrification.
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of a period of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
In The festival of Holi, the importance of colors is as important as the ceremony of 'HolikaDahan' because it is the day when we burn our inherent vices in the fire.
Holi makes us forget our rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other's happiness and glad tidings, and it conveys the message of love, unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Just a couple of days ago, we celebrated our Republic Day festival with gaiety fervour.
This is the very first time in history that heads of 10 Nations attended the ceremony.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a rather long letter on the Narendra Modi App, urging me to touch upon the subjects he has referred to.
He writes, The 1st of February is the death anniversary of astronaut Kalpana Chawla.
She left us in the Columbia space shuttle mishap, but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over.
I am thankful to Bhai Prakash ji for beginning his long letter with the sad departure of Kalpana Chawla.
If one possesses the will the determination, a firm resolve to achieve something, nothing is impossible.
Many Vidushis of India have contributed in composing the verses of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee... its a long list of names.
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, save the girl child, educate her. But centuries ago, it has been mentioned in our ancient texts, in the Skand Puran :-, R:, This means, a daughter is the equivalent of ten sons.
This underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society.
And that is why, in our society, women have been accorded the status of Shakti.
This woman power binds closely together society as a whole, the family as a whole, on the axis of unity oneness.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples.
He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him.
Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30.
Today there are many sectors where our woman power is playing a pioneering role, establishing milestones.
This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website.
The countrys woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country society these days.
Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station.
You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff.
All departments have women performing duties...
the commercial department, Railway Police, Ticket checking, Announcing, Point persons, its a staff comprising over 40 women.
Today our Nari Shakti is assuming leadership roles.
When we refer to Adivasi women, a stereotypical image comes to our minds, comprising jungles, pathways in the woods and women carrying kindlewood on their heads.
But the woman power of Chattisgarh, the tribal women there broke this stereotype presented an all new picture of themselves.
Dantewada in Chattisgarh is a Maoist infested region.
Violence, torture, explosives, guns, pistols... the Maoists have created a scary reign of terror.
In this dangerous atmosphere, Adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, a number of women have become part of this phenomenon.
This has three benefits- on the one hand self-employment has empowered them on the other, the Maoist infested region is witnessing a transformation.
And simultaneously as a consequence, it is strengthening efforts towards protecting the environment.
I laud the efforts of the District Administration which has played a significant role in the successful endeavour of these women by ensuring availability of grants imparting training to them.
Time and again we keep hearing people utter There is something special that we as a people possess... no threat is big enough to annihilate our existence.
Leaving out things that are beyond the constraints of time and accepting betterment in things wherever necessary.
And this is a salient feature of our society...
The benchmark of any living society is its self correcting mechanism.
In our country, there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices, both individually collectively.
This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system.
The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils.
Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle.
The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders.
In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills.
Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric... let us build an empowered, capable New India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration, in fact every member of the human chain for this massive, special initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written on My gov. He was undergoing an expenditure of six thousand rupees a month on medicines alone for the treatment of his father.
Earlier, he wasnt aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now that hes come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75.
He has expressed his wish that I mention this in Mann Ki Baat, so that it reaches the maximum number of people and they can benefit from it.
many of them have been telling me about it.
I too have seen videos put up on social media by beneficiaries of this scheme.
It is a matter of joy learning about happenings like these.
It gives you inner satisfaction.
I felt good to see Shriman Darshan ji think about sharing with others what he gained from it.
This is great help for the common man, especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings.
Generic medicines sold under this scheme strictly conform to prescribed standards set by the World Health Organisation.
That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices.
Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are now available at Amrit Stores at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres at hospitals.
The sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of uality affordable health service to the poorest of the poor, so that a healthy prosperous India comes into being.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards it.
The photo showed that a grandson was participating in the 'Clean Morna River' along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.
The Morna river was a perennial river flowing throughout the twelve months of the year but now it has become seasonal.
The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth.
A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks.
An action plan was chalked out and on January 13th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of 'Mission Clean Morna' sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out.
On January 20th, 2018, this Sanitation Campaign continued in the same vein and Ive been told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned.
'Mission Clean Morna' shows that if a person is determined to do something, then nothing is impossible.
Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal corporations administration, all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement, I laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards.
These awards also attract attention in newspapers and television also.
But if you scrutinize, then you will be proud of the fact that there many loftier personalities amidst us and you will naturally be proud of the very fact that today the common man is being cited for Padma awards without any recommendations.
There was a certain methodology of awarding Padma Awards every year, but this entire process has been changed for the past three years.
Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country.
Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online.
In a way, the selection of these awards has been transformed completely.
You may have noticed that many ordinary people not visible in big cities, in newspapers or on TV are being awarded with Padma citations.
Now the identity of the awardee is not the deciding factor of the award, rather the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard the name of Arvind Gupta ji.
He has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science.
He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste
towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
A similar story is that of Sitavaa Jodatti from Karnataka.
She has not been hailed as 'Goddess of women empowerment' just for nothing
For the past three decades, in Belagavi, she has made a great contribution towards changing the lives of countless women.
At the age of seven she had dedicated herself as a Devadasi but in a turnaround, for the welfare of the Devdasis, she has spent her entire life.
Not only this, she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women too.
You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was employed in a small job for eking out his living, but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form.
Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world.
He has exhibited his paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests.
She has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory.
She has mastery in synthesizing medicines used for treatment of snake bites.
Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
Identifying her anonymous persona, she has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her contribution to society.
I would like to mention another name today, that of 75 year old Subhasini Mistri, hailing from West Bengal, who was selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who, in order to construct a hospital, cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables.
At the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment, and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard-work.
I am convinced that there are many men and women in our land filled with gems, Bahuratna-Vasundhara, many gifted women and men who remain faceless or unknown.
These people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences.
Beyond awards, there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9th every year.
It was on the 9th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe.
This year we organized a program on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin were invited.
You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated.
whether working in the field of cyber security, or dedicated to Ayurveda, entertaining the society through music, or through poetry
I would thus like to thank the European Union, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them in making people in India and people the world over aware of their exemplary work.
The 30th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
They were not just mere theories.
At present we witness at every step how accurate Bapu's words were.
What can be a bigger tribute than taking a vow that we shall tread the path of Bapu - and walk, as far as possible
My dear countrymen, with my best wishes to all of you for 2018, my speech draws to a close.
Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and its a coincidence that this day happens to be the last day of the year of 2017.
You and I shared many thoughts and ideas the entire year.
Your steady stream of letters to Mann Ki Baat, your comments, this exchange between minds always infuses new energy in me.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our conversation will go on, just the way it is.
We will renew this exchange of thoughts on newer topics in the year to come, well share new experiences.
Heartiest New Year greetings to all of you.
Over the last few days, the festival of Christmas was celebrated across the world with gaiety and fervor.
People in India too celebrated Christmas with warmth and cheer.
The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of service, Sewa bhaav.
The essence of the spirit of service can be felt in the Bible too.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans used to cite, serve living beings as if worshipping the almighty.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji, in all these roles, performed the great task of inspiring people.
He fought against oppression injustice. His teachings to people focused on breaking the cordons of caste and religion.
In this endeavour, he stood to lose a lot on his personal front. But he never let antagonism raise its ugly head in his path.
In every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice peace was palpable.
Come, let us all resolve to imbibe abide by lessons from his great teachings exemplary life and mould our own life in accordance with them.
Youll be surprised, since the New Year comes every year, the 1st of January arrives every year
The entire nation is eager to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
As voters of this century, you too must be feeling proud.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of a democracy.
You too can be the makers of 21st century India and this opportunity comes into being, very specially, on the 1st of January.
And today, in this edition of Mann Ki Baat, I wish to speak to our successful young men women between 18 25, all infused with energy and resolve.
I firmly believe that the dream of our New India will be realized through the skill fortitude of these energetic youth.
When we talk of new India then that new India will be free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption
free from filth and poverty.
New India will be a place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force.
One should decide ones own path and also decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get going.
How could we realize our resolves before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is that we build up a mass movement for making a magnificent- glorious 21st century India
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward in areas like skill development, innovation and entrepreneurship and are achieving success.
I wish that the New India Youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from it.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about positivity during the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Nothing is impossible for a man having positivity and zeal.
In English too, it is said, Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
During the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Lakhs of tweets were posted on Positive India hashtag (), which reached out to more than nearly 150 crore people.
In a way, a wave of positivity which emanated from India spread all over the world.
All tweets and responses received were really inspiring.
It was indeed a delightful experience.
Some countrymen shared those incidents of this year which left a special impact on their minds, a very positive one at that.
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
SOUND BITE My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I, Delhi.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Waade.
He died in an accident.
Only we know of the situation we faced at that time.
Assistance from the government helped us a lot and I could gather the strength to stand myself.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
A national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village Bhinnar.
Two actions taken by our Indian soldiers deserve a special mention one was the Surgical Strike carried out in Pakistan which destroyed launching pads of terrorists and the second was the unique valour displayed by Indian soldiers in Doklam. These are without parallel.
My name is Satish Bewani.
We had a problem of water scarcity in our area and we used to depend on an army pipeline for the last forty years.
Now an Independent pipeline has been constructed.
So, this is our achievement in 2017.
There are a large number of such persons who have brought in positive transformation in the lives of many people through endeavour at their own level.
In fact, this is the New India which we are all collectively building.
Let us enter into the New Year with such little achievements, begin our New Year and take a concrete steps in the journey from Positive India to Progressive India.
When we all talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one experience.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on fire in 1990.
Terrorism and violence were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral land and flee from there.
For a young child, such an atmosphere of violence could easily create darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it be so.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he has become a source of inspiration not only in Jammu Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps.
Just last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
Whatever little time I spent with these daughters, I got inspired myself. These are the strength of our nation, they are my youth, they are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala.
Millions of devotees come to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
It is a huge challenge maintaining cleanliness around such a large religious place where devotees in such huge number come.
And especially, since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests.
One police officer P.
Vijayan initiated a programme Punyam Poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness.
And, he began a tradition that the yatra of devotees will remain incomplete if they do not contribute by performing some physical labour or the other in the cleanliness programme.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lords worship.
Every morning, there is a uniquely pleasant scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive.
However big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an official be each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive.
There are many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabrimala and the contribution of Punyan Poonkavanam in this are so immense that each devotee contributes and participates in it.
And, all of us took a resolve that on the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we shall make some contribution in the direction of making Clean India which he had dreamt of.
Efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely taken across the whole country.
A change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
Cleanliness Survey 2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas.
This survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
They will analyse the use of the Cleanliness App and also about bringing reforms and improvements in various kinds of service centres.
It will also be observed whether the cities have created a system wherein cleanliness of cities will became public habit, or the citys habit for that matter.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things which appear small but they have a far reaching impact on our image as a society.
Today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
For decades, injustice was being rendered to Muslim women but there was no discussion on it.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
And I'm glad that our government paid heed to this matter.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs issued corrective measures and we ameliorated this restriction by phasing out a tradition that had been in practice for the past seventy years.
Today, Muslim women can perform Haj without 'mahram' or male Guardian and I am happy to note that this time about thirteen hundred Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without 'mahram' and women from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India, have expressed their wish to go for the Haj pilgrimage.
I have suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that they should ensure that all women who have applied to travel alone be allowed to perform Haj.
It should be our constant endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for all of us.
But 26th January, 2018, will especially be remembered through the ages.
This is unprecedented in India's history.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years of formation in 2017 and in 2017 25 years of India's partnership with ASEAN were completed.
On 26th January the arrival of great leaders of 10 nations of the world as a unit is a matter of pride for all Indians.
My Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, by the way our country is a country of festivals.
There is hardly a day which does not have a festival ascribed to it.
All of us have just celebrated Christmas and the New Year is on its way.
May the New Year bring greater happiness, glad tidings and prosperity for all of you.
Let us move forward with all renewed zeal, enthusiasm, fervor and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial orbit around sun and in this month Makar-Sankranti is also celebrated.
This is a festival linked with nature.
Though all of our festivals are associated with nature in one way or the other, but in our country blessed with the bounty of cultural diversity, there are different ways to celebrate this wonderful episode of nature in different forms.
All of these festivals are usually celebrated between 13th and 17thJanuary.
These festivals may have different names, but their origins stems from attachment to nature and agriculture.
Felicitations to all of you on the occasion of these festivals.
And once again, best wishes for the New Year 2018 to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There must be hardly an Indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her, does not revere her.
She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through.
She turns ninety this 28th of September.
Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone.
This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately.
Modi Ji : Lata Didi, Pranaam.
This is Narendra Modi speaking.
Lata Didi: Pranaam.
Modi Ji : I gave you a call, since on your birthday this time, I would be travelling on a flight.
Modi Ji : I am returning in the intervening night of the 28th the 29th, slightly past your birthday.
Lata Didi: Okay, Okay.
Lata Didi: There are many who are elder just by age, but greater are the blessings of those who do great work, and hence are greater.
Lata Didi: All this is just the fruit of the blessings of my parents the blessings of my listeners.
Lata Didi: Jee...
Modi Ji : And it gives me joy when you proudly say that your mother was a Gujarati.
I do not wish to trouble you further, since I can see how busy you are with myriad pressures on the work front.
There are so many things that you have to think of.
After you had gone to touch your mothers feet, I too sent someone to her to seek her blessings.
Modi Ji : Your affection made Mother very happy.
Once again, I extend my heartiest wishes for your birthday.
Modi Ji : But I could not be there because of paucity of time.
Lata Didi: Of course, sure.
My dear countrymen, with the advent of Navaratri today, the air is bound to be full of new hopes, new energy, newer zest and newer resolves, once again.
After all, its the festival season.
The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country.
Homes will be filled with joy
you must have felt this... there are many people around us who remain deprived of these celebrations.
And this is what is termed as Chiragh Tale Andhera, darkness just beneath the lamp
Perhaps this adage is not just a set of words for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration.
there are some homes, bathed in shimmering lights
on the other hand, just close by, there are some homes mired in darkness.
There are homes where sweetmeats are left to rot there are homes where children yearn for a sweet
At least in our homes, items that are in excess and thus, not required anymore, could be allocated for Delivery Out.
In many cities, many NGOs run by young friends have formed Start ups for this endeavor.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly.
Can we, this time, during the festival season, dispel some of the darkness beneath the lamp with due awareness and resolve
Of course, Laxmi should be welcomed in the traditional way.
In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity.
Can we, this time around in society, organize programmes to felicitate daughters in villages, towns and cities
This Diwali, can we arrange programmes to honor the Laxmi of India
If you look around, youll find many daughters and daughters-in-law who are performing extraordinarily.
Some must be engaged in teaching underprivileged children, others could be occupied in spreading awareness in the field of sanitation and health, while many could be doing society a service by working as Doctor and Engineers.
Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them.
We could do something more
we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media, using the hashtag BHARAT KI LAMI.
The way we jointly ran a mega campaign Selfi with daughter, which spread globally.
My dear countrymen, as I have mentioned earlier, a great advantage of Mann Ki Baat is that, Im blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people, known or unknown, directly or indirectly.
A few days ago, AleenaTaayang, a student from far off Arunachal has written an interesting letter to me.
I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I wouldve benefitted a great deal.
I liked quite a few aspects of this book, but I noticed that it contains may mantras for students, but for parents and teachers this book does not have much.
even my young friends bear this trust that whatever they ask the Pradhan Sevak, the principal servant of the country to do
My young student friends, first of all, I thank you for writing to me.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors more than twice and special thanks for pointing out shortcomings in the book.
As you have told me, I shall positively try to write something for parents as well as teachers, as and when I get the time to pen a new edition.
But I urge all of you...
can you be of help to me
I shall duly go through them, study them.
Ill give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt, I shall try and incorporate that in my own words.
And quite possibly, if the suggestions are sufficiently large in number, it will lend certitude to the idea of a new edition.
So, I shall eagerly wait for your thoughts to flow.
Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, you even discuss the engagements.
But, I hope you are aware that I am just as common a being as you are.
Hence I too heard the speech and watched the match.
The sheer simplicity and maturity displayed by the 23 year old Daniil Medvedev touched everyone.
It surely stirred me.
Moments before this speech, he had suffered defeat at the hands of Tennis legend Rafael Nadal, 19 times grand slam winner.
An event such as this would have pushed anyone towards remorse and despair
The way Medvedev heaped praise on his opponent after a defeat in a fierce duel makes him a living example of the true essence of the spirit of sportsmanship.
Of course, on the other hand champion Nadal too showered glowing praise on Daniils game.
The display of the indomitable ardour of the defeated and the sheer humility of the victorious in the same frame was a sight to behold.
If you havent heard Medvedevs speech yet, I shall urge you, especially young friends to watch this video.
It holds much for people across the age and class spectra to see and learn.
These are moments that go way beyond winning and losing, wherevictory and defeat cease to be.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tellyou now is directly for your benefit.
Discourses and debates will continue, the support and opposition will continue, but, if some things are checked before they proliferate, then there is a huge benefit.
Things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages.
But, if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it, then a lot can be saved.
Continuing in the same vein, I feel, today, that I should definitely have a talk with my young friends.
We all know that addiction to, tobaccois very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction.
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it.
Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence.
But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic.
You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India.
An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette.
In ane-cigarette, theheating of nicotine-containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed.
While we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes, a misconception has been generated about e-cigarettes.
Like the conventional cigarette, it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it.
His effort is that no family member should take to smoking. He knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body.
There is no confusion about the dangers posed by a cigarette.
It only causes harm and this even its seller too knows. The smoker also knows this fact and so do people around.
But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different.
There is little awareness among people about e-cigarette.
They are also completely unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e-cigarettessneak into the house out of sheer curiosity.
And Kids at times pretending to be showing some magical trick, blow smoke in the presence of Peer Company or their parents, without lighting a cigarette or striking a match to light it
You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someones pocket, the smell can be detected.
However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigaretteas a fashion statement, keep itbetwixt their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it.
The younger generation is the future of our country.
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country. It does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children.
This scourge and this obnoxious habit should not become rooted in our society.
I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
Do you still remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice
All these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of Fit India.
I am sure you will not misconstrue whatever Ive said, but rather happily accept my counsel
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great providence that our India has been the birthplace and work-place of extraordinary denizens, who spent all their lives, not for themselves, but for the good of the society.
Our Mother India, our country is a bountiful land
Many gems of human beings took birth here.
One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint.
Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becominganoble example for the entire world.
I once again pay heart felt tributes to Sister MariamThresia and congratulate the citizens of India, and especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today, while we are celebrating Gandhi 150, our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of Single Use Plastic.
In view of the kind of lead that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the countries of the entire world are looking towards India as a model example.
I am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of Single Use Plastic on 2ndOctober.
In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign.
My attention was drawn towards his work, so, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him.
It could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country.
When I first encountered the term Plogging, it was novel even to me.
Perhaps this word is in usage in certain measure in foreign lands.
Ripudaman ji, I felt nice talking to you.
Through endeavor, we shall not only pay better attention to our health
I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps.
Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you.
My dear countrymen, groundwork for 2ndOctober is going on all over the country and also the world over, but we want to transmute 'Gandhi 150' as a task on the path of our duty.
We want to move forward devoting our lives in the interest of the nation.
hence for that reason, every year on 31 October, we run for fostering unison in the country as 'Run for Unity', all over the nation.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, that on 15 August, I had in my address said from the ramparts of Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 tourist destinations in India.
At least 15 places and if possible, make a program to stay over there for an over night, two-night stay.
You should observe, understand and experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when holidays come in the shape of Diwali and allied festivals, people do travel and that's why I urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
My dear countrymen, the 27th of September, two days prior to today, was celebrated as World Tourism Day and you will be happy to know that certain reputed tourism agencies of the world which rank standards of travel tourism have shown that India has displayed a lot of improvement in the Travel Tourism Competitive Index.
And all this has been possible due to your cooperation and especially because understanding the importance of tourism has increased.
If we tried all that harder, then by the 75th year of our independence, we would have carved a place for ourselves amidst the major tourist destinations of the world.
My dear countrymen, once again I wish you all the best for various festivals that would be celebrated in the oncoming season in India, which is filled with diversity
Also, please see to it that during the celebration of Diwali, firecrackers do not lead to incidents of fire or loss of a life.
Once again heres wishing many felicitations to you all.
Mann Ki Baat November 2017
My dear countrymen, namaskar
Mann Ki Baat October 2017
The mega festival of Chatth, celebrated 6 days after Diwali, is one of those festivals which are celebrated in accordance with strict rituals regimen.
In everything associated with it like cuisine or attire, traditional norms are adhered to.
The unique festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature worshipping nature.
Surya Jal The Sun Water are central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made of bamboo clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja articles.
The expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival.
Before the advent of Chatth, people come together to clean up their homes, and along with that cleansing of rivers, lakes, pond banks and pooja locations, that is ghats, with utmost enthusiasm fervour.
Sun worship or Chhath Pooja is a festival of protecting the environment, ushering in wellness and discipline.
It is believed that the rationale behind this tradition is that, it destroys his ego that proves to be an impediment in ones path of progress.
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
But whenever I look at the overall outcome of Mann Ki Baat, it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven into the warp weft of our common citizens lives, cent per cent.
Take the examples of Khadi and handloom.
You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi Handloom store.
During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise.
Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi Handicrafts have risen almost by 90.
One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi handloom.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this.
Khadi was Khadi foundation earlier and we talked of Khadi fashion but with my recent experience I can say that after Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion now, it is becoming Khadi for transformation.
Khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them.
It is playing a very important role for gramodaya.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp whether there could be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our countrys soldiers.
All of you must have celebrated Deepawali with traditional fervour.
To me, Diwali brought a special experience.
Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel.
Memories of Diwali celebrations with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu Kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart.
On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the countrys borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds.
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations.
United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of October.
Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world.
And, we are believers in Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam which means the whole world is our family.
And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN.
You may be aware that the preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter both start with the words We the people.
India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this.
In its initial phrase, it was proposed as all men are born free and equal which was amended and adopted as all human beings are born free and equal with the efforts of the Indian representative Hansa Mehta.
It appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought.
Indias most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always been extending active support to UN Peace Missions.
Many of you may be getting to know this for the first time.
More than 18 thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over.
These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world.
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved.
Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Very few people may know that India was the first country which sent a female police unit to Liberia for the United Nations Peace Mission.
And see how this initiative from India became a big source of motivation for other countries too.
Later, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will surely feel proud to know that Indias contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas.
They need to know and adapt to various situations and different cultures.
Every Indian feels proud while remembering him.
He was the only UN peacekeeper, a brave-heart, who was awarded the Param Veer Chakra.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one among those Indian Peacekeepers who carved a special niche for themselves in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Force Commander for an operation in Namibia and he gave his services to ensure the Independence of that country.
General Thimaiyya, who had been Indias army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person.
She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA.
And Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated.
She later proved herself true to her name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture.
She brought the people together by infusing a sense of national-awakening.
She travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and ideology.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped publication of Basus research and publicity through her articles and conferences.
This is Indias unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to this.
In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time.
Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health, started cleaning drains and roads.
She was a woman who could live a luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor.
And, it is inscribed on her grave Here reposes Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India.
Undoubtedly, she did so.
There cannot be any other befitting tribute to this great soul than every Indian taking a lesson from her life and emulating her.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of Children's Day celebrated on the birthday of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India.
Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life - have started to appear in children nowadays.
It is indeed surprising today, when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits.
Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
If youll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life.
I would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, we can make the elder family members accompany these children to the playground and play with them.
The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children.
Yoga will be helpful for especially our young friends, in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders.
It is simple because it can be easily learned and it is accessible, since it can be done anywhere.
No special tools or fields are needed.
There are several studies being conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes.
These studies are being carried out in AIIMS too and the results that have emerged so far are very encouraging.
Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of medical treatment only instead of this we should make them a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indians heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title.
I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India.
Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field.
I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and the spectators.
This world cup was a super event where the whole world was watching you.
Such a big spectacle, I was astounded to see the energy, enthusiasm, and zeal of all the young players.
The world cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Regardless of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The whole world including India enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both full of interest and entertainment for football lovers.
The signs that the future of football is very bright have started to appear.
I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again.
My dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about Swachch Bharat, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I will have to do the program Mann Ki Baat every day and every day Mann Ki Baat will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness.
Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts.
Sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an officials zeal.
A few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me photographs with a caption- Before and After
I was overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs, no matter how upset he is on witnessing the filth around him, and wondering how the mission of cleanliness will be fulfilled - then I have to tell such people that you can see for yourself the toil, resolve and determination of the members of the Ecological Protection Organization, in these living pictures.
Just on seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope.
This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum.
Forts are symbols of our heritage.
And it is the duty of all countrymen to keep our historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate Ecological Protection Organization, their entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, well celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs hes guru to the entire world.
He envisioned the welfare of all humanity and considered all castes to be equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true humanity.
He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice dedication.
He advocated the message of equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete endeavour.
He ran a LANGAR which sowed the seeds of the spirit of service amongst fellow beings.
Partaking of LANGAR together created a feeling of unity oneness in people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji voiced three messages for a meaningful, fulfilling life- Chant the name of the Almighty, work hard and help the needy.
In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani.
Come 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Come, let us try advance on the path of his ideals teachings.
My dear countrymen, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, two days from now, on the 31st of October.
All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation stone of modern, unified India.
We can learn a lot from the unparalleled saga of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation one constitution.
His decision making ability infused in him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit determination.
It was only he who could achieve this task of uniting India. He conceived a nation where everyone was equal.
One ideal of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will always be inspiring to all of us.
He had said No division of caste or creed should be able to stop us, all are the sons daughters of India, all of us should love our country and we should carve out our destiny on the foundation of mutual love harmony.
These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution in giving a unified texture to the nation is without parallel.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Sahab, Run for Unity will be organized throughout the country, which will see the participation of children, youth, women, in fact people of all age groups.
I urge you to participate in Run for Unity, the festival of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, you mustve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination.
May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
It is now a full three years since I started speaking to you over Mann Ki Baat.
This is the 36th episode today.
Most of these are inspiring to me.
I just take half an hour of your time in a month but people keep sending suggestions, ideas and other material over Mann Ki Baat during all 30 days of the month.
And, the result of this whole exercise is that the government has started realizing the sensitivities and powerful ideas of the people of far off places.
And, this is why the three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is in fact a journey of our countrymen, their emotions and their feelings.
I am thankful to our countrymen for having provided me an opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one sentence of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
He always used to say A- sarkari, Asarkari, meaning non government is effective.
I surely believe and feel that now after three years, social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect, positive as well as negative.
And I am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it.
And, in one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had said that while having our food, we must also be conscious of consuming only as much as we need and see to it that there is no wastage.
But, later, I received letters from all corners of the country. Many social organizations and many youth are already observing this in practice.
And then I saw that a lot many people came forward to donate for this cause.
Once, I saw a selfie of a sarpanch with a daughter and referred to the same in Mann Ki Baat.
In no time, Selfie with Daughter became a big campaign not only in India but across the whole world.
I was in a meeting with the Tourism Department recently.
I asked people who were planning to go travelling that where-ever they visit Incredible India, they must send photographs of those places.
Lakhs of photographs from every corner of India were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
Ive experienced through Mann Ki Baat that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign.
Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events incidents over those three years ran across my mind.
The nation is always ready to move in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the benefit of others, for social good, for the countrys progress.
This is what I gathered, learnt and understood from our countrymen during three years of the Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country.
I have noticed that these days interest in Khadi has increased very much and I had just said that I was not asking people to makeover into wearing Khadi permanently
rather, since there are a number of fabrics then why not Khadi also be one of the fabrics of your choice
May be a bed-sheet in the house, a handkerchief or a curtain, it has been felt that the younger generation has got interested in Khadi.
Sale of Khadi has increased and as a result of this, the poor mans household has directly got connected to employment.
Discount is offered on Khadi from 2nd October and people get quite a good rebate.
I once again urge that we should try and take forward the Khadi movement.
We should follow the spirit of helping the poor to be able to light a Diwali lamp.
The poor of our country will derive strength from this and we must do it.
The increasing interest in Khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the Khadi sector as well as those connected, in any way, with Khadi.
How do we bring in new technology, how do we increase productivity, how do we introduce looms driven by solar power
How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years
Sewapuri Khadi Ashram at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was lying closed for 26 years but has got a fresh lease of life now.
A number of thoughts were implemented.
New employment opportunities were created for a number of people.
Khadi Gramodyog revived its training centre at Pampore in Kashmir and in this sector Kashmir has so much to offer.
With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts.
Even people have started exchanging Khadi items as gifts.
We now experience how something grows naturally.
My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last months Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti.
We shall connect people through cleanliness.
Our Honourable President inaugurated this programme and the country got connected.
The old or the young, men or women, city or village everyone has become a part of this Cleanliness campaign now.
And when I say Sankalp Se Siddhi, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove.
I have seen that some people are continuously working and are determined to bring out results.
I noticed something else this time one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also.
This time a number of competitions were organized on the theme Cleanliness is Service.
More than two and a half crore children took part in an Essay Competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children made paintings.
They drew pictures based on their own imaginations.
Whenever there is a reference to cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons.
We can see in Swachhata Hi Sewa movement as to how the electronic media and the print media in our country can render a big service to the country.
Just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards Bilal Dar, a young man of 18 years from Srinagar.
Bilal Dar got connected to the Swachhata Abhiyan or Cleanliness Campaign since the age of 12-13 years and has been working for the last 5 to 6 years.
He clears plastic, polythene, used bottles, dry or wet waste every piece of dirt from Aisas biggest lake near Srinagar.
And I am glad that they have not only appointed Bilal as their ambassador but also given him a vehicle, and also a uniform and he goes to other areas and educates people about cleanliness and inspires them and keeps tracking them till results are achieved.
Bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history, it is but natural to recall our great men.
The month of October is a month to remember so many of our titans.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, there are many great leaders who gave us the direction towards the 20th and 21st century, led us, guided us and faced so many hardships for the country.
Indias former President Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to speak of Nanajis contribution in rural development while talking to the youth.
He used to mention Nanajis contribution with great respect and he even went to a village to see Nanajis work there.
We are not obliging these great men by remembering them but we remember them so that we may be able to foresee our forays into the future and the direction we choose.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will surely mention Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel but on 31st October, Run for Unity - Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat - will be organized throughout the country.
The element of Unity in diversity being Indias speciality comes naturally to us.
We feel proud of diversity but have you ever tried to feel this diversity
I would like to re-iterate to my countrymen, and specially to my young friends that we are alive aware beings.
We should feel Indias diversity, touch it, feel its fragrance.
You may see for yourself, that for your inner development also, these diversities of our country work as a big teaching tool.
You travel around the world, I have no issues but have a look at your own country too.
People of North India may not be knowing what all is there in the South
People of West India may not be knowing what all is there in the East
Our country is full of such myriad diversities.
If you refer to Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand, our former President Abdul Kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around India, they got to see and understand India and they got inspired to do and die for the country.
All these great men travelled widely in India.
At the beginning of their endeavour, they tried to know and understand India
tried to live India within themselves.
Can we make an effort as a student to learn, understand and try to live as per the traditions, culture, attire, eating habits and beliefs of different states, different societies, different groups of our country
There will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate, understand adapt.
This is my personal experience, I had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of India.
In more than four hundred fifty districts, I had a night stay too.
And now, when I am shouldering this responsibility in India, that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful.
That helps me a lot in understanding things.
I request you too, to feel the Unity in Diversity which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy.
If we eat a new dish every day, we wont have to repeat any variety throughout our life.
This is the power of our tourism.
I would request that during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know, understand gain something.
Your vision will expand.
And, who can be a better teacher than experience
Generally, October to March is the suitable time for tourism.
If you happen to meet people there, send their photos too.
Write not only about architecture or natural beauty but write something about their daily life too.
Send on Mygov. And on Narendra Modi App.
A thought comes to my mind, that in order to promote tourism in India what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state every Indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state.
If possible, one must visit these seven places.
Can you provide some information about that
You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state.
In other words, how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind
Similarly, whatever you have seen throughout India and whichever seven out of these you liked the best and you wish that someone should see these things, or should go there, should get information about them, then you must send photos and information of seven such tourist spots on Mygov.
The Government of India will work on that.
The government will accept suggestions about making films, videos or preparing publicity material and about promoting that destination.
Come, get connected with me.
You can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, being a human being, there are many things that touch me too. They agitate my heart.
They leave a deep impression on my heart.
After all I am also a human being just like you.
You might have noticed one recent incident, a unique example of grit, determination and patriotism that was witnessed by all countrymen.
The Indian Army has got two extraordinary brave women officers they are Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi.
Their husbands laid down their lives in the service of mother India.
One can imagine ones agonizing mental state if her world gets shattered at such a early age
But Swati Mahadik, the wife of martyr colonel Santosh Mahadik resolved to face the difficult situations and she joined the Indian Army.
She received training for 11 months putting in great efforts and she put her life at stake to fulfill her husbands dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubeys husband Mukesh Dubey was a Naik in the army and attained martyrdom while fighting for his country. His wife Nidhi also took a resolve and joined the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to have a deep sense of respect for these two bravehearts, our Matri Shakti.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to both of them.
They have evoked a new inspiration and a new awakening among millions of our countrymen.
Many congratulation to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali.
FIFA under- 17 world cup is being organized in our country.
I am sure reverberations of the spirit of football will be heard all around.
It will evince more interest in Football in every generation.
There should not be a single school-college ground in India where we will not see our youngsters at play.
Come on, the whole world is coming to play on Indian soil, let us make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on.
It is a time for praying to Ma Durga.
The whole environment is filled with sacred fragrance.
On this pious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to our countrymen and pray to Ma Shakti to let our country attain newer heights so that the desires and expectations of all our countrymen get fulfilled.
May our nation be blessed with the strength to face any challenge.
May the nation move forward and may the year two thousand twenty two- 75 years of Indias Independence be an attempt to realize the dreams of our freedom fighters, the resolve of 125 crore countrymen, with their tremendous hard work, courage and determination to fulfill our resolve and prepare a roadmap for five years. We have moved on
My good wishes to all of you.
Celebrate festivities, enjoy with enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar.
Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect these are inherent to us.
We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa ParmoDharmah from our childhood.
In my address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions.
No one has the right to take the law into ones own hands in the name of ones beliefs.
In the Constitution given to us by Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar there is every provision for ensuring justice for each and every person.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression whether it is a person or a group neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Each and every person will have to abide by the law the law will fix accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished.
Even our festivals are replete with diversity.
Many of our festivals are linked straightaway with farmers and fishermen.
Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam.
The Jain community celebrated the SamvatsariParva yesterday.
In the month of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community.
The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood.
It is also known as the KshamavaniParva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other with, michhamidukkadam.
We have been hearing in our shaastras, our holy texts, KshamaVeerasya Bhushanam, that is, forgiveness is the adornment of the brave.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country.
When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about SarvajanikGaneshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival.
This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty.
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
This festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism.
And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions.
Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors.
We should think about what more can be done in this direction.
In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-uha will be celebrated in a few days from now.
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-uha.
In individual households, festivals and cleanliness are linked together.
In fact, preparationsfor festivals always begin with cleaning.
This is nothing new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character.
Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.
My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing.
These days, a new measure to gauge a new dimension, a new parameter, has come in to being.
If you go on YouTube, you will see that children in every home are making earthen Ganesh idols and are colouring them.
The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October.
That is when, in Dhanera in the Banaskantha District of Gujarat, volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind cleaned twenty-two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner.
If this committed effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us, our country will certainly take our nation to greater heights.
My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal SevaYahiPrabhuSeva, Service to Water is Service to God.
Lets create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
Whenever and wherever possible, lets look for the opportunity.
Do Shramdan, Donate through labor.
Come together on Sundaysand Holidays.
Go to settlements in your neighborhood, go to nearby villages, but do this in the form of a movement.
I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural and political leaders, people in the government, collectors and sarpanches, to begin creating an environment of cleanliness at least fifteen days ahead of Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October so that it turns out to be the 2nd October of Gandhis dreams.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.
in where after constructing a toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary family, who you helped.
My friends from the social media can run a few creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the virtual world, to see results in the real world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition.
You can write essays in various languages and there is no age limit.
The best three participants three at the district level, three at the state level will be given prizes.
I invite one and all Come, join the Cleanliness Campaign in this manner as well.
Take one or another step towards cleanliness.
The number of listeners are in crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me, send messages, and get their messages recorded on phone, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all.
Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness.
I always look forward with anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share.
My endeavor always is to see for myself, hear, read and understand your thoughts.
Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a friend of mine.
She always tries to help others, but one habit of hers amazes me.
I went for shopping with her at a mall.
She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza.
Whereas, she haggled for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who took us to the mall.
On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees.
I feel very bad.
We spend extravagantly in high places, without a single thought, but when it comes to our hardworking brethren, we quarrel with them over small amounts.
Now after listening to this phone call, I am certain that you would have been shocked and awakened and would probably have resolved not to repeat such a mistake.
Dont you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers - in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work we start bargaining with him, haggling with him: No not so much, make it two rupees less, five rupees less
And it is us, the same people, who go to dine at a fine restaurant, we dont even bother to check the bill, we just go ahead and pay the money, without thinking twice.
Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we dont bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining.
Two or five rupees make no difference to your life, but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him.
Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.
My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey was unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well.
Sports means, physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement.
Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together.
The young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports and in todays computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station.
Play FIFA on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field.
You must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else.
Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games. And the mother has to shout, When will you go out
How times have changed There was a time when the mother would demand to know when her son would be back. And today, she demands to know when he will go out.
Young friends, the Sports Ministry is launching a Sports Talent Search Portal to search for sporting talent and to groom them. Any talented child who has an achievement in sports, can upload his biodata or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected emerging players. The Ministry is launching the portal tomorrow.
The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be making India their home.
Come, lets welcome the young visitors from all across the world with the festival of Sports, lets enjoy the sport, and create a conducive sporting atmosphere in the country.
I speak about sports today, and just last week, a heartwarming incident took place, which I would like to share with my countrymen.
I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters, some of who, were born in the Himalayas, who had absolutely no connection with the sea.
Six of these young daughters are in the Navy. Their grit and zeal, is inspiring for all of us.
These six young women will embark on a voyage across the seas, in a small boat, INS Tarini.
The expedition has been named, NavikaSagar Parikrama. They will circumnavigate the globe and return home, after many months.
Sometimes they will spend 40 days on the seas in one go
at times, thirty.
Our six daughters riding the waves of the high seas, with courage, is the first instance of its kind in the world.
Each and every Indian would be proud of these daughters.
I salute their valour and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I too am making a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp to ensure that you can read it.
For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of these daughters.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teachers Day.
It is the birthday of our former President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but all through his life, he saw himself as a teacher.
He preferred to live a teachers life.
He was committed to being a teacher.
The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning.
Can we run a campaign in mission mode
When we speak about transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers.
The teacher plays a vital role in transformation.
In the life of every teacher, there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebodys life.
We will play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a collective effort.
Come, lets move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform.
Ananya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts.
Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened.
This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world.
When there is cash in the hand, or in the pocket or at home, one is tempted to indulge in wasteful expenditure.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren.
And those who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, have received the benefit of insurance as well.
Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti BimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojna, with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor.
For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupeeinsurance,they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days.
Banks have conducted surveys about how the common man has benefitted from Jan DhanYojna, from Insurance Schemes, from RuPay Card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna.
My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you michchamidukkadm.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
We human beings have a natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season.
Animals, birds, flora nature in its entirety, is filled with the joys of the season.
But sometimes, when the rain unleashes full force of its fury, we come to realise the extent of the destructive might of water.
Mother Nature gives us life and nurtures us, but at times natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes wreak havoc on a massive scale.
Climate change, altered weather cycles, and transformations in the environment, are also having a big negative impact.
Recently, in certain parts of India, particularly, Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some areas of Bengal, have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters, caused by excessive rains.
Flood affected areas are being closely monitored.
Relief efforts have been undertaken on an extensive cale.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are also personally visiting affected areas.
The state governments too are making maximum possible efforts on their part to provide relief to the flood affected people.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and common citizens charged with the spirit of service are also making their utmost efforts to help the affected people in this situation.
Crops, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, communication links everything gets affected.
In particular, our Farmer brethren have to bear a lot of losses because of the damage to their crops and fields. Therefore, we have formulated a scheme for the insurance companies, especially crop insurance companies, to make them more proactive, to ensure quick settlements of claims for farmers.
People are also voicing their difficulties.
Before the monsoons, the entire government machinery was brought into a state of preparedness through mock drills undertaken at most of the places.
NDRF teams were deployed.
We should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions, which could safeguard us against losses.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
This time around, there have been innumerable letters and phone calls in regard to GST. People are still expressing their happiness about GST, and are also eager to know more about it.
I would like you to hear one such phone call: Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri ji, this is Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day and was deeply impressed.
In the same manner, Goods and Services Tax, GST, was launched on this very day last month.
I would like to hear your views on this.
Thank you.
It has been one month since GST was implemented and its benefits can be seen already.
I feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how because of GST prices of various items essential for him have come down, and commodities have become cheaper.
When a person from the North-East, someone living in the remote areas, in the hills or forests, writes a letter to communicate that in the beginning, he used to be apprehensive about GST wondering what it was all about, but now that he has begun to understand it, he feels that things have become much easier than before.
Doing business has become so much easier.
And most important of all, the trust of customers for the traders is increasing.
I have been observing how GST has impacted the transport and logistics sector
how the movement of trucks has increased.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.
And some day, the Pundits of Economics, Pundits of Management and Pundits of Technology, will certainly undertake researches and write about Indias GST experiment as a model for the world.
It will become a case study for universities across the world.
The implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale, with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country, is in itself a pinnacle of success.
The world will definitely make a study of it.
And this implementation has had all the states participating in it and sharing the responsibility.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the Centre together.
And as a result, one overriding priority for every government has been to ensure that there is no burden on the plate of the poor on account of GST.
I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process.
GST is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of India.
This is a historic achievement.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reformation.
I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution.
Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of India, with their ardent desire for freedom, came together, fought together, and suffered hardships
This was the time when the people of India, in every part of the country be it a village or city, the educated or illiterate, the rich or poor, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the uit India Movement. Peoples anger was at its peak.
Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhis clarion call and the mantra of Do or Die they flung themselves into the struggle.
Mahatma Gandhi gave a call for the uit India Movement on 9th August, but each and every prominent leader had been imprisoned by the British Government, and it was during this time that the second generation of leadership comprising great men like Dr.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narain played a leading and pivotal role.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942, two different personas of Mahatma Gandhi can be seen.
The whole scenario of the uit India Movement was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point, there was such a heightened sense of intensity, that a Mahapurush like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
The reason for this entire success was the peoples support, peoples resolve, and peoples struggle.
The entire country had come together as one to fight for the cause.
And I sometimes think that if we link the pages of history, it is seen that the First War of Independence took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle which began in 1857, continued to be manifested in one or the other corner of the country till 1942. This long time period ignited the intense longing for freedom in the hearts of the people.
Each one became committed to do something.
The determination did not diminish with each passing generation.
New people kept coming forward each time in place of those who departed and the country kept on every moment endeavouring tirelessly to uproot the British Rule.
This perseverance, this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942 the clarion call of uit India was such that within five years, in 1947 the British were compelled to leave India.
1857 to 1942 the yearning for freedom had reached the grassroots, had reached everybody. And 1942 to 1947 these decisive five years became integral for the masses to successfully attain through resolve, freedom for the country.
These five years were indeed decisive.
I would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation.
We became free in 1947. This is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
Governments have come and gone.
Systems have been made, changed, nurtured, and expanded.
Everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in ones own way.
There have been efforts towards increasing employment, poverty alleviation, and development.
Expectations have also risen.
We should celebrate 15th August 2017 as the Sankalp Parva or the Day of Resolve, and in 2022 marking 75 years of Freedom, we will certainly transform that resolve into Siddhi or attainment.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive for the countrys Independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022 can and must play a decisive role for the future of India.
Five years from now, we will celebrate 75 years of Indias Independence.
A resolve that we will positively fulfil in the next five years.
They can use technology videos, posts, blogs, scripts, novel ideas to put forward all these.
Transform this campaign into a peoples movement.
A uit India uiz is also being launched for my young friends on NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with Indias glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement.
I try to give words to their dreams, and I am glad that for the past 3 years, I get suggestions from every corner of the country for August 15, as to what I should speak on the 15th August and which issues should I include in my address on the occasion.
I read these myself and shall try to express them in whatever time I have with me on 15th August.
I have planned to keep my speech short this time not more than 40-45-50 minutes.
My countrymen, I would like to say one more thing to you.
Indias economy has in itself an element of social economics.
And we should never underestimate its value.
Our festivals, our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment.
Our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too. And each of our festivals are directly linked with the financial conditions of the poorest of the poor.
Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Pooja, Diwali these will be observed one after the other.
And this is also the time when the poor get an opportunity to earn an income and of course this adds a spontaneous joy to the festivities.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhis in small household units, many months before the festival of Rakhi.
A variety of Rakhis are made in a whole range of materials, from khadi to silken threads. People prefer homemade Rakhis these days.
Rakhi makers and their sellers, sweets shops vendors the professions of hundreds, thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival.
it is directly connected with those poor families who make small diyas or earthen lamps.
Today as I speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor, I want to touch upon the subject of environment as well.
I have observed and sometimes think that the citizens of our country are more aware and active than me.
For the last one month, environmentally conscious citizens have constantly written letters to me.
And they have requested that I talk about eco-friendly Ganesha idols, well in time for people to plan for clay Ganesha idols during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition, and this year marks the 125th anniversary of community Ganesh festival.
125 years and 1.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started the Sarvjanik Ganeshotsav with the basic aim to inculcate the spirit of unity, enhance awareness in society, and promote the culture of togetherness.
So this year we should again, during the Ganesh festival, organise essay competitions, have open discussions and remember the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak.
Come, let us link our festivities with the economic welfare of the poor, let the joys of our festivals connect with the households of the underprivileged, bringing monetary happiness to the have-nots. This should be the endeavor of all of us.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations.
My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports they are scaling new heights.
We as a nation take great pride in our daughters.
Recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet our daughters, the members of our Womens Cricket team.
This stress, this tension was evident on their faces also.
So while speaking to these daughters, I put forth a different viewpoint before them.
We have seen during many such events where if the Indian players fail, the anger of the country is vented towards the players.
Some people cross all limits of decency and say and write things that inflict pain and hurt.
Not only this, they lauded them and showered them with high praise for their brilliant performance.
I view this as a healthy and pleasant change and I told these daughters that only they were blessed with such good fortune, and hence they should banish any thought of not having been successful.
You may not have won the final match but you have won the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Truly our young generation, especially the daughters of our country are doing so much to bring glory to the nation.
My dear countrymen, I remind you once again of Agast Kranti, of 9th August, I remind you once again of 15th August.
Every countryman should make a resolve, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to realise that resolve.
Come, lets march together as we do our bit.
The destiny, the future of the country shall be brighter, let us move ahead with this belief.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
The weather is changing.
It has been extremely hot this year.
But it is good that the monsoon is moving ahead on schedule on its natural course.
The weather has become pleasant in several parts of the country with abundant showers.
As a result of the rains, the cool breeze has brought about some respite from the oppressive heat of past few days.
One has seen that no matter how hectic the life is, no matter how tense we are, whether its ones personal or public life, the arrival of the rains does lift ones spirits.
The Car festival of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra, is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour.
This festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world.
The underprivileged of the country are deeply connected to Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
But few would know that in English, there is a word, juggernaut which means, a magnificent chariot, that is unstoppable.
In the dictionary, the etymology of the word juggernaut traces its roots to the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
And therefore, we can observe that the world has in its own way accepted the significance of the Car Festival of Lord Jagannath, The Rath Yatra.
On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my heartiest greetings to one and all.
Let us come together and take inspiration from these holy festivals and share their joyous treasures, and take the nation forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came across a very inspiring incident at Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brethren reside in that little village and in a way, form a majority of its population.
During this Ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets.
Now, to construct these household toilets, the government gives financial assistance, under which, they were provided a sum of 17 lakh rupees.
You will be pleasantly surprised and happy to know that, during this holy month of Ramzan, these Muslim brothers and sisters, returned this money to the government, saying, they would construct these toilets with their own labour and their own money
and that this sum of 17 lakh rupees be used for providing other facilities in the village.
I felicitate the residents of Mubarakpur, for transforming the pious occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society on.
Each and everything about them is inspiring.
And the most important of it all is that they have freed Mubarakpur of the scourge of open defecation.
We know that in our country there are three states that have already been declared Open Defecation Free states, that is, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF, this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, government and especially the people of these five states, for achieving this objective.
We know very well, that tremendous hard work is required to achieve anything worthwhile, whether it is in ones own life or for the society.
If we have bad handwriting, and we want to improve it, we have to consciously practice for a long time.
Only then will the habit of the body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is also similar to this.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
Everyones attention will have to be drawn.
We will have to repeatedly remind ourselves of good inspirational incidents.
And Im happy to see that cleanliness is no longer confined to being a government programme.
It is getting transformed into a movement by the society and the people.
And when government functionaries take this initiative forward with the participation of the masses, it becomes even stronger.
Recently I came across a wonderful incident, which I would like to share with you.
This happened in the Vizianagaram District of Andhra Pradesh.
To construct 10,000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in those hundred hours.
And my Dear Countrymen, you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10,000 toilets in hundred hours successfully.
71 villages became ODF.
in, through letters and Akashvani.
One needs to be constantly alert about our Democracy, that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy
1975 25th June it was a dark night that no devotee of democracy can ever forget.
The country had virtually become a prison.
The voice of the opposition had been smothered.
Several prominent leaders including Jai Prakash Narayan had been jailed.
The judicial system too could not escape the sinister shadows of the Emergency.
The press was completely muffled.
The present-day students of journalism and the champions of democracy have been endeavouring towards raising awareness about that dark period, by constant reminders, and should continue to do so.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail at that time.
After one year of Emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, in which he describes the state of mind during those turbulent times.
We have to further fortify that legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today, is proud and holds his head high.
21st June 2017 Yoga has permeated the entire world.
From the seashores to the mountains, people welcomed the first rays of the sun, with Yoga.
Which Indian wouldnt be proud of this
It isnt as if Yoga didnt exist before, but now the threads of Yoga have bound everyone together, and have become the means to unite the world.
Almost all the countries in the world made Yoga Day their own.
In China, Yoga was practiced on the Great Wall of China, and on the World Heritage site of Machu Picchu in Peru, at 2400 metres above sea level.
In France, yoga was performed in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower.
In Abu Dhabi in UAE, more than 4000 persons participated in mass yoga.
In Herat, in Afghanistan, on the India Afghan Friendship Dam, Salma Dam, Yoga added a new aspect to Indias friendship.
In a small country like Singapore, programs were organised in 70 places, with a week long campaign.
On the occasion of International Day of Yoga, the UN released ten stamps.
A Yoga Session with Yoga Masters was organised at the UN headquarters.
The staff of the UN and diplomats from across the world participated.
Yoga has created a world record again this time also.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, around 55 thousand people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I too had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event held in Lucknow.
But I also had the good fortune to practice Yoga in the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers practiced yoga in Siachen where temperatures reach minus 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Whether it is our armed forces, or the BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF, each one of them, apart from their duties has made Yoga a part of their lives.
On this Yoga Day, since this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had asked you to share photos of three generations of the family doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also took this idea forward.
I received a lot of photographs out of which, selected photographs are compiled and uploaded on the NarendraModiApp.
Recently, I had the opportunity to go to one of my favorite events.
Panicker Foundation, which encourages people to cultivate the habit of reading books and to enhance their awareness towards this, by organising celebrations such as Reading Day, and Reading Month.
I had the opportunity to go for the inaugural function, where I was told that instead of bouquets, they gift books.
I liked it.
Thus I was also reminded of what had slipped my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had set this tradition of welcoming, by not giving bouquets, but books or handkerchiefs instead.
And that too, a Khadi handkerchief, so that it promotes Khadi.
Till the time I was in Gujarat, this habit had been ingrained in us, but after coming here, I had lost that habit.
When I went to Kerala, it was rekindled.
I have already begun to issue instructions in the government.
Here too we can gradually nurture this habit.
And the life span of a bouquet is very short.
You receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it.
But when you present a book, it becomes a part of the household, a part of the family.
During my past UK visit, in London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth had invited me to dine with her.
So many years have passed and yet, ueen Elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by Mahatma Gandhi.
And she was happy to show it to me, when I went there.
As I gazed at it, the ueen encouraged me to touch it.
A small gift by Mahatma Gandhi, has become a part of her life and a part of history.
I know that these habits do not change overnight, and when we talk about it, we invite criticism.
Despite that, one should keep talking about it, and keep making the effort.
Now, I cannot say that if I go somewhere and somebody brings a bouquet I will refuse it.
No, I wont do that, but we will talk about it even though there is criticism, and then gradually, the change will happen.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are numerous tasks to be handled.
I have to remain deeply absorbed in files, but for my own self, I have developed a habit of reading daily, at least a few of the letters I receive and because of that I get a chance to connect with the common man.
I get a variety of letters, written by all sorts of people.
Recently, I had the opportunity to read a letter, which I feel, I should share with you.
From the far south, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a housewife, sent me a letter.
She wrote, that she thought about engaging in some economic activity keeping in mind her responsibilities such as childrens education, to lend some financial assistance to her family.
She got some money from the bank, under the Mudra Scheme and commenced working towards procuring some items from the market for sale.
Then she came to know of the Government E-Marketplace system initiated by the government.
And then she registered herself for the scheme.
Whoever wants to supply any item to the government, small things such as electric bulbs, dustbins, brooms, chairs and tables, they can register themselves.
She has written that she got the money from the Mudra Scheme and started her business, then she registered the inventory of all her products on the E-GEM website, and then she got an order from the Prime Ministers Office.
It was news to me also, I wondered what the PMO would have ordered.
She wrote that the PMO had ordered two thermoses, and she was paid Rupees 1600-.
This is empowerment.
This has transparency, this has empowerment, this has entrepreneurship too.
Government E-Marketplace - GEM.
I would certainly like that whoever wishes to sell their products or business items to the government, should increasingly get connected with this website.
I believe that this is an excellent example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance, and its objective is Minimum Price and Maximum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we take pride in Yoga, on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the unique attribute of India, that whereas we have our feet firmly on the ground with Yoga, we have our dreams to soar beyond horizons to far away skies.
Recently, India has had many achievements in sports, as well as science.
Today, Indias flag is flying high not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites with the Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And besides India, these satellites are of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, nearly 14 such countries.
And with Indias Nano Satellite Mission, we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture, farming, and dealing with natural disasters.
We are all aware that a few days ago, ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
You can well imagine the magnitude of the achievement of our scientists in space.
On the 19th of June, our Mars Mission completed one thousand days.
You may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the Mars Mission in orbit, this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months.
It had a life expectancy of 6 months.
But Im happy that the strength of the endeavours of our scientists has been such that not only has this crossed six months
The completion of one thousand days, is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space odyssey.
And our sportspersons, through their prowess, skills and accomplishments win laurels for the country as well.
Recently Indias Badminton player, Kidambi Shrikant has brought glory to the nation by winning Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory.
T.
Sports play an important role in personality development also.
There is a great significance of sports in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in our country.
If the children in our family are interested in sports, they should be given opportunities.
My dear countrymen, let me mention once again, that this Season of Rains, with its abundance of festivals and festivities, brings with it a unique new feeling of the times.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced .
I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan.
Prayer, spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during Ramzan.
We, Indians, are very lucky that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India and its 1.
25 billion people can take pride in the fact that people from all communities and faith are available here.
idolaters and those loathing idol-worship co-exist. We have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies, different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co-existential living .
In the ultimate , any religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill.
I, once again convey my best wishes to all.
Last time around while sharing my thoughts in Mann ki Baat I had mentioned) a new word and had specially exhorted our youth to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone, experience new things
as this is the age when one can experiment and take risks and accept new challenges of life.
I am glad that many people have given me feedback.
All of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me.
I could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages.
But whatever I could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music, some tried hands on a new musical instrument, some of them are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn a new language. Some are learning cooking, some others are learning dance and drama
I had almost left the habit of reading.
Therefore I decided to pick up the habit during vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison.
I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age.
Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.
I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country.
Many years ago, I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.
I went to see the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarji.
Veer Savarkarji had written a book Majhi Jannmathep while in incarceration .
He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell.
He was confined to a very small cell.
These seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture.
I was inspired to visit the Cellular Jail only after reading Savarkarjis book Maazi Janmthep.
A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring.
There was hardly any state in India youths from which were not exiled to the dark waters of Andamans and were forced to spend their youth in this Cellular Jail during the freedom movement.
Once we go there We come to know as to why this was called Kaalaa Paani or the dark waters If you get a chance, please pay a visit to this place which is actually a pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
This year the United Nations have chosen the theme Connecting People to Nature.
In other words, we may say back to basics.
And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, One must care about a world one will not see. This means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that.
If you return after a tiring days work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air this will fill you with fresh energy.
Our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy.
All of us have experienced this but we do not register this, we do not connect this in a single thread of sequence.
Now on, kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition , a new spirit emerges from within you.
So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well.
And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment.
And if we shall protect the environment, our future generations will reap the benefits.
Vedas, describe the Earth and the Environment as the basic sources of energy.
In India, it has been said Earth is the mother and I am her son.
According to Vedas, the purity within us is because of the Earth.
The Earth is our mother and we all are her children.
If we recall Lord Buddha, a fact comes to light that his birth, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all three happened under a tree.
But we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments.
These days , I keep receiving news from our states.
Almost in every state, a big plantation campaign gets underway with the onset of monsoon.
Millions of trees are planted.
The whole world observes this as World Yoga Day.
In a very short time, 21st June has got worldwide recognition as World Yoga day and is connecting people.
At a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been Indias great contribution to the world.
We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga.
Like Yoga connects body, mind, heart and soul: similarly it is connecting the world now.
At a time when People are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days, Yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress-free life.
How to mount on the journey of life with the inter-play of body, mind, thoughts and behavior can be better realized and understood through Yoga.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day.
Last year, I made announcements of some Yoga competitions and some awards as well.
It is a very interesting suggestion.
He has said since this is the Third International Yoga Day I should make an appeal that on this third international Yoga Day, three generations of the family should do yoga together.
Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos.
It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga.
I express my gratitude for this suggestion and I feel that as our Selfie with Daughter campaign had proved to be a very inspiring experience. So will this campaign of posting pictures of three generations together performing yoga will evoke curiosity across the nation as well as across the world.
You should certainly send the pictures of three generations doing yoga together to me on Narendra ModiApp or on Mygov.
This will be the picture of yesterday, today and tomorrow and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow.
I invite all of you.
We are still left with about three weeks for the International Yoga Day.
Start practicing from today itself.
You too kindly spread the message of Yoga and connect people with it.
This, in a way, is a movement on preventive health care.
I invite you all to get connected to it.
Ever since you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the people and when for the first time when I got a chance to address from the ramparts of Red Fort on 15th August, I had talked of cleanliness.
From then onwards, I get a chance to stay in different parts of the country.
Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness.
Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness.
Many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads.
The cleanliness drive that you had begun from the Ghats or Banks of the Ganges in Kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you.
You are right, that wherever I go, the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event.
But, after receiving this phone call, I also started thinking that the point made there was pertinent.
Besides usual arrangements to welcome the Prime Minister, cleanliness will also be high on the agenda.
This is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person.
I congratulate everyone connected with this Cleanliness programme providing strength to it.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
This is in a way a humorous suggestion.
I do not know whether I would be able to do it or not.
Modi ji, when someone asks for your visit , your stay, you should ask as to what would be the standard of cleanliness, if they wish to invite you. How many tonnes of waste would you present to me so that I may accordingly decide the duration of stay.
The idea is very good but I will have to think.
But, one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts.
How many people shall we be able to save from ill health.
This will be a big service to humanity.
Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management.
Young persons connected with Start-ups will also come forward with newer schemes and also come forward with new equipments.
If we follow discipline, then the waste bins that are going to be placed in these 4 thousand towns will collect dry garbage in blue waste bins and liquid garbage in green waste bins.
The waste from our kitchens, be it vegetable peels, leftover food, egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins.
This waste can be utilized in fields, and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins.
The second type of waste is like old newspapers, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, leather, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin.
Ive a firm belief that we will develop a culture and the new steps that we take towards achieving cleanliness will continue, only then will we achieve the dream of Gandhiji, achieve the kind of cleanliness that he dreamt of, today.
I must admit with pride that if a single individual decides it in his heart then a huge Public campaign can be launched .
Cleanliness is also one such drive.
A few days ago, you must have heard that the Versova beach in Mumbai, which was infamous for its filth has now transformed into a a clean and beautiful beach.
People toiled for about 80-90 weeks, unceasingly and turned Versova beach around by extracting thousand of tonnes of waste materials and today Versova beach is clean and beautiful.
This campaign was owned by Versova Residence volunteer or VRV.
A gentleman called Afroz Shah started this mission from October, 2015 whole heartedly with all his might, slowly people started joining his bandwagon and turned into a peoples movement.
For this outstanding work, United Nations Environment Programme or UNEP awarded Champion of the Earth Award to Sh.
Afroz Shah, and thus he has become the first Indian to achieve this distinction.
I have been told that this movement found maximum leadership amidst women.
The women of that area took out torch rallies to spread awareness, went from house to house, street to street and inspired the people towards this goal.
I felicitate the mothers and sisters of Riyasi from the bottom of my heart.
I also congratulate the administrators there for making an excellent beginning by turning one block in the state of Jammu and Kashmir open defecation free.
My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.
Three years ago you vested the responsibility of Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the People upon me.
It was analyzed by every segment of society.
And this is a great process in democracy.
I thank those people, who provided critical and important feedback. The mistakes and the shortcomings once highlighted can be rectified.
for an aware nation, an awakened nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things.
And there are many families who have written to me these very feelings.
And as I said, as an ordinary citizen, I too get affected emotionally.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
Come let us move ahead while loving nature in such a pleasant atmosphere.
My many felicitations and best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dearest countrymen namaskar.
I have come across the inquisitiveness of children, the ambitions of the youth, and the gist of the experience of elders
Every time the inputs that come in response to every episode of Mann Ki Baat, are analyzed in detail by the government.
What are the kinds of suggestions, what are the kinds of complaints and what are the experiences of the people
It is an inherent human nature to advise others.
While travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs, the next person immediately advises a cure.
But when we analyzed the suggestions minutely, I really became quite emotional.
Most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives.
They are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect, capacity, ability and circumstances so that something good must happen.
And when these things came to my notice I felt that these suggestions are extraordinary.
These are suggestions that have emerged out of a certain squeeze of lifes experiences.
Some people also give suggestions thinking that if an idea has the potential to work then more people would listen to it if it is heard on a wider platform and hence many people can benefit.
And not only this, when I mention something positive, such memories come to recall, it is very much a pleasant experience.
I had never even imagined that in our country especially the young generation has been doing this kind of work from a long time.
Some social institutions have been involved in this activity for many years was common knowledge, but the youth of my country are engaged in this task, I only came to know later.
Many have sent me the videos of their work in this field.
There are many places where Roti Banks are operating.
In the Roti Banks, the leftover rotis are deposited by people, they also deposit the leftover vegetables and the needy can obtain food from these banks.
The person who donates rotis feels a sense of satisfaction also, the recipient also does not feel humiliated.
These are examples of how work can be achieved with the help of society.
Today is the last day of month of April.
1st May is the foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf.
Both states have made constant strides to scale newer heights of development and have contributed toward the advancement of the country.
And both the states had a steady stream of great men whose lives and sterling contributions in every sphere of society is a source of inspiration for us.
In remembrance of these great men, on the foundation day of these two states, we should take the pledge of taking our state, our country, our society, our city, and our family to glorious heights in 2022, when we celebrate 75 years of independence.
Plans should be drawn to achieve that pledge and taken forward with the cooperation of all citizens.
The heat that we used to experience in months of May-June in our country is being felt in March-April this year.
So, when I was taking suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time.
Most of the suggestions or practices to beat summer are not new but are prevalent for a long time, however it is very useful to remember them from time to time.
I have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically.
Once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray.
And also watch if the birds came or not.
We think as if it is a game going on , but in actuality, this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child's mind.
In our country, we are traditionally imbued with a sense of symbiotic co-existence with animals, birds and nature yet it is necessary that collective efforts in this regard should be emphasized.
When I was Chief Minister of Gujarat, Syedna Sahib the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Community had completed his hundred years.
He lived till 103 years.
As part of the celebration of his 100th year the Bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
Nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world.
This effort also found a mention in the Guinness book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days.
Young friends, I want to have a chat with you too.
I am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones.
Parents also raise their children in a very protective manner.
True there are other extremes also but most are brought up in this comfort zone syndrome .
Now the examinations have ended and you must be done with your plans to enjoy the vacation.
Summer vacations feel good inspite of scorching heat.
But as a friend, I want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation.
I believe some people will put them to use and they will tell me about that too.
There is huge difference between to sometime to see something on television or reading about it in the book or listening about it from acquaintances and to experiencing the same thing yourself.
The experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone.
We all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families.
Friends have you ever thought of travelling in a Second Class railway Compartment without a reservation, and going for atleast a 24 hours ride
Try it, just experience it once, I am not asking you to try it again and again, do it once.
In the evening, take your football or your volleyball or any other sports item and go to a colony of poor and lesser privileged people.
Play with those poor kids, you will experience a new kind of joy, the kind you would have never experienced in your life before-thats the kind of joy youll experience
Have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteer organizations are engaged in this kind of work.
Sometimes there are summer camps, for development of different facets of your personality. You can participate in these camps.
But at the same time, dont you feel that after youve attended such summer camps, you have participated in the courses for development of personality and you reach out to those people who have no such opportunity and teach them what you have learned without taking any money.
It is possible that you can teach them.
I am also worried that technology evolved to reduce the distance, technology came in to being to end the boundaries. But the end result of this is that six people in the same house are sitting in the same room but they are separated by unimaginable distances
Everyone has become so busy with technology in his or her own way.
Collectivity is also a way of life, collectivity is power in itself.
Secondly I had mentioned about skill acquisition, dont you feel that you should learn something new
You get so submerged in the preparation for the examinations, get so consumed to obtain the best grades, there are coaching classes going on even in vacations and youre worrying about the next exam
Sometimes you feel scared that our youth have become robot like, living life like a machine.
Cant a little emphasis be given on this aspect in Skill development
Get away from technology, and try to spend some time with yourself. Learn a musical instrument or learn a few sentences of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
If you dont know how to swim, then learn swimming, try doing some drawing, even if you do not end up making the best drawing, try to practice putting hand to the paper
You want to learn to drive a car but then do you ever want to learn how to drive an auto-rickshaw
You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which youre tied down
Do something out of the box, my Friends.
This is the only time to make something of your life.
And if you think that after appearing in all exams, at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill, then you wont get a chance.
At that time you will be tangled into other things and therefore I tell you if you have a passion to learn magic then learn the card tricks
Keep showing the tricks to your friends.
Try to know about things about which you have no prior knowledge, it will definitely benefit you.
Your inner human potential will awaken and this will provide a great opportunity for development.
I can tell you from my experience of going around the world, that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas.
But before leaving for a particular place, preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge, understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people, if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else
Go to a destination and spend three to four days there.
Then go to the next and spend a like duration there.
You will get to learn a lot that way.
Where did you travel to
Make good use of the hash tag Incredible India and share your experiences.
Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity.
The new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash.
It does not need cash.
It has begun adopting digital currency.
make others join you in that. If the new member does three transactions, performs financial business thrice, you stand to earn ten rupees for that.
Ten rupees will be credited to your account from the government.
If you involve twenty persons in a day, by evening, you wouldve earned two hundred rupees.
The traders can earn, so can students.
And this scheme is valid till the 14th of October. It will be your contribution towards making of a digital India.
The red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared.
I have received a very interesting phone call.
One can discern from this phone call that common men detest these tendencies. They feel distanced.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivaa Choubey calling from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I wish to say something on the governments ban on red beacons.
I dont have to be caught in a traffic jam and I dont have to stop for anyone as well.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision.
Many thanks for that.
The exit of the red beacon through a government decision is part of a system.
But we have to make efforts to cleanse it out of our minds.
We have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I maintain time again that we should keep re - visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture.
That lends us energy and inspiration.
This year, we the hundred twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya.
But India is such an ancient Nation that we are the proud inheritors of thousands and thousands of years of heritage, knowledge and civilized existence and have an opportunity to observe and celebrate a memorial heritage of over thousand years.
A thousand years ago, he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same.
We are indeed fortunate that in every era, for eradicating social evils, noble souls, great men were born in this society itself.
Now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we should gain inspiration from him in our endeavour to foster social unity, to bolster the adage unity is strength.
In memory of Saint Ramanujacharya, the government of India is releasing a stamp tomorrow, the 1st of May.
I respectfully salute Saint Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance.
In many parts of the world, it is observed as Labour Day.
And when Labour Day is referred to, labour is discussed, labourers are discussed, it is but natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
You would be aware that for the facilities and respect that workers have earned, we are grateful to Babasaheb.
One can never forget the contribution of Babasaheb towards the welfare of the working class.
Today when I refer to Babasaheb, when I talk about Ramanujacharya, Im also reminded of the great 12th century saint social reformer from Karnataka Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
In the 12th century, he had laid down his profound thoughts on labour workers.
He had mentioned in Kannada Kaay Kave Kailas...
it means, it is just through your perseverance that you can obtain Kailash, the abode of Shiva.
Today when I refer to workers, it is but natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi.
My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima.
Followers of Lord Budha across the world celebrate the festival.
And in India, Ashoks life perfectly epitomizes the transformation from war to enlightenment.
And very specially to our neighbouring countries.
May our neighbouring countries be with us in our journey, may they develop equally.
There are many projects under way.
On the 5th of May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
The capacities of this satellite and the facilities it provides will go a long way in addressing South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
Natural resources mapping, tele medicine, the field of education, deeper IT connectivity or fostering people to people contact - this satellite will prove to be a boon in the progress of the entire region.
It is an important step by India to enhance co-operation with the entire South Asia... it is an invaluable gift.
I welcome all the South Asian countries who have joined us on the South Asia Satellite in this momentous endeavour...
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their childrens examinations.
There would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over, but where the examinations are still on, there certainly would still be some amount of pressure.
However, at a time like this I would only say that students may listen again to what I had said in my Mann Ki Baat last time.
I am sure that my suggestions there will be of substantial help while they sit for their examinations.
Today is the 26th of March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
It was a historic war against injustice, which was fought under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh, on this significant day.
And I hope that Bangladesh marches ahead on the path of progress. I also assure the citizens of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, and a good friend, and we will continue to work together shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards the peace, security and development of this entire region.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too, has been composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
There is a very interesting fact about Gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but Knighthood was also conferred upon him by the British.
After the Jallianwallah Massacre by the British in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the legendary figures, who raised their voices in protest. And it was at the same time, that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
The inhuman massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager, who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
On the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh Ji and his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were hanged to death by the British, and we are all aware of that. There was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for having served Mother India - - there was no fear of death.
They had sublimated all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes inspire us to this day.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
And the entire British Empire feared these three young men.
They were in jail, certain to be hanged, but still the British remained anxious about how to deal with them.
That is why, though the scheduled date was the 24th, they were hanged on the 23rd of March.
This was done clandestinely, which is not the usual practice.
And later, their remains were brought to present day Punjab, and were secretly cremated.
Many years ago, when I first got the chance to go there, I could feel a certain vibration in that place.
And I would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to Punjab, whenever they get the chance, and visit the samadhi of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
On the one hand, brave hearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution.
And on the other hand, exactly one hundred years ago on the 10th of April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had launched the Champaran Satyagraha.
This year marks the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In Indias struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire journey of Indias freedom struggle, especially in the context of the methodology of the struggle.
This was the period when, in the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and the mill-workers strike in Ahmedabad, the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible.
Gandhi returned to India in 1915, and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave the country a new inspiration.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today.
Just imagine that one man, who came to India in 1915, and had been in the country for barely two years.
And it was the Champaran Satyagraha that brought to the fore, Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, and his strong ability to gauge the pulse of Indian society. Mahatma Gandhi, through his demeanour and deeds, could inspire the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate, to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the British Rule
this was a manifestation of an incredible inner strength, through which we can experience the vastness of Mahatma Gandhis great persona.
But if we reflect upon the Gandhi of a hundred years ago, the Gandhi of the Champaran Satyagraha, that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life.
We can all learn from Gandhi Ji what it means to begin a life of public service, how hard one has to work, as Gandhi did.
And that was the period when all the stalwarts, that we hear about today: Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji, and others were all sent to the villages by Gandhi Ji.
To get themselves arrested voluntarily to fill jails, on the one hand, and on the other to immerse themselves in creative work.
Gandhis style of working had an incredible balance.
What the word, Satyagraha means, what disagreement can mean, what Non-Cooperation in the face of such a vast Empire could be Gandhi Ji established a completely new vision of resistance, not through mere words, but through a successful experiment.
for the benefit of all, for the happiness of all, and the ceaseless enterprise to achieve something for the country, the society, would bring about the realisation of the dreams of the great souls who laid down their lives for the sake of Freedom.
Today, as we live in the 21st century, which Indian wouldnt want to see India change, which Indian wouldnt want to be a partner in the transformation of the country
This desire of 125 crore countrymen for change, the effort to change, is what will lay a strong foundation of a New India.
There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients.
Our country is a many splendoured land. The belief that Service to humanity is service to God, is innate to us.
If we look at it in its collectiveness, in an organised manner, it comes across as a major force.
When there is a talk of New India, its criticism, its analysis, it counter views, are but natural, and that is a fundamental of democracy.
But it is true that if 125 crore countrymen resolve, and decide to walk step by step on a path to realise that resolve, the dream of New India can be fulfilled in our lifetime.
And all these things are not necessarily achieved through the Budget, government projects, or government money.
If every citizen resolves to obey traffic rules, if every citizen resolves that he will discharge his duties honestly, if every citizen resolves that he will not use petrol or diesel one day in a week - - these are not very big things.
But these will contribute to the realisation of the dream of this country, this New India, that is being nurtured by 125 crore countrymen, and this realisation will be achieved before their eyes.
In essence, every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities.
This in itself would be a good beginning to the New India.
Why dont we too, be a part of this journey from Swaraj to Suraaj by making our lives disciplined, and filled with resolve. Come, I invite you.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to all of you.
The BHIM-App was launched just about two to two and a half months ago, but approximately one and half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level.
You cant imagine how you can serve the country in this way and become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Recently, several Digidhan-mela programmes were organised to educate the people and to increase public awareness.
Close to 12 and half lakh people have won prizes. Seventy thousand traders also won the prizes instituted for them.
We should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash, of currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in.
But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on the topic of cleanliness.
I want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness.
Every day I pass by a river, in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
The river flows under the Rispana Bridge before passing by my home.
For the sake of this river we went to settlements on its banks, spoke to people and took out rallies too, but to no avail.
I want to request you to kindly highlight this issue by sending a team there, or through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the agony of this young daughter, the 11th class student.
How enraged she is by seeing the river strewn with trash.
I consider this to be a good omen.
This is exactly what I want - - that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, rage, we will be compelled to act against this scourge.
The good thing is that Gayatri is expressing her own anger, and giving suggestions to me, but she also goes on to say, that she has made several efforts but could not succeed.
There has been an awareness ever since the launch of the Cleanliness Movement.
Each person has become associated with it in a positive manner.
This has now truly taken the form of a movement.
There has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor.
When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance.
This movement can be accomplished collectively.
It is a difficult task, but we have to do it.
I am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation, in children, in students, in the youth, augurs well for achieving good results.
I would urge my fellow countrymen, who have heard Gayatris message in my Mann Ki Baat today, that it should be a message to all of us.
We cant even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten.
Have you ever thought about how much food we waste
Have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we dont thus waste our food
This is not something that needs to be taught.
As it is, in our families, mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat.
There is always some effort made in this direction, but still the apathy on this issue is a crime against society.
It is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if we are able to avoid wastage, the family too benefits economically.
So while it is good to care about society, this is beneficial to the family as well.
I am not urging too much on this issue, but I would like this awareness to spread.
I do know some young persons, who are active in such campaigns.
They work hard, and these are our own young people.
You will find such people somewhere in each and every state of India.
The lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food.
We should take only as much as we can eat.
See, these are the pathways leading towards change.
And those who are health conscious always say that, there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate.
Now that we are talking about health, 7th April is World Health Day.
United Nations has resolved to provide universal health coverage for all by 2030.
This year on the occasion of World Health Day on the 7th of April, United Nations has focused on Depression, which is the theme this year.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world suffer from depression.
The problem is that we are unable to fully comprehend it even amongst those around us, and perhaps we also hesitate to talk about it openly, with our family and friends.
I want to tell my countrymen, that depression is not incurable.
There is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with.
The first mantra is the expression of depression instead of its suppression.
Share openly what you are going through, with your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, and teachers.
Have you ever wondered why he does so
You can be sure that this the first step towards depression.
If he prefers to stay away from a group, and tends to be all by himself, do make an effort to ensure that this does not happen.
He should be given an opportunity to be amongst people with whom he speaks openly.
Try to encourage him to express himself, to reveal and bring out his insecurities and complexes while engaging him in light-hearted happy conversation.
Just as diabetes can be the root cause of all sorts of diseases, depression too, destroys all our abilities to sustain, to fight, to display courage and to take a decision.
If you try to sympathise with the sufferings of others with a sense of service, a new self-confidence will be born within you.
By connecting with others, serving them and serving them selflessly, you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind.
Yoga too is a good means for mental wellbeing.
Yoga helps in relieving tension and stress, and leads one towards a happy state of mind.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
If you have any ideas for the Third International Yoga Day, please do send me your suggestions and guidance through my mobile Application.
You could compose as many songs and poems on Yoga, as possible, as these can be easily understood by the masses.
Today I would like to say something especially to mothers and sisters also, since health and wellbeing have been a major part of our conversation today.
Recently, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
These working women will now be given maternity leave of 26 weeks, instead of the earlier 12 weeks, for their pregnancy and delivery.
There are now only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this matter.
That is how these children will become true assets of the country when they grow up.
The new year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New year is Gudi Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, for the Sindhi it is Cheti Chand, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsar Pooja in the Awadh Region, Jud-Sheetal in the Mithila region of Bihar and the festival of Satuvani in the Magadh region.
India is a country blessed with rich diversity.
My heartiest greetings and best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Many thanks.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The melodious chirping of birds warms the cockles of our hearts.
Not just flowers, fruits too appear to be shining bathed in the sun rays on tree branches.
The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself.
At the same time bright yellow flowers of mustard swaying in their fields kindle hope in the hearts of the farmers.
Blossoming of bright red Jungle Flame flowers, better known as Tesu or Palash heralds the advent of Holi.
Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner.
Amir Khusro has written:Phool rahi sarson sakal banAmbwa phoote, Tesu phooleKoyal bole, daar daar,that is,Behold the mustard blooming everywhere, all aroundHere the inflorescence on the mango tree, there the Jungle Flame blossomsThe nightingale cant help but sing merrily on the branches.
When nature is at her joyous best, when the season is enchanting, we human beings too enjoy this to the fullest.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a persons life.
And therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile.
Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of Indias pride.
Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves.
15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India.
Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world.
And we know that over the last few years, ISRO has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours.
After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to planet Mars, recently ISRO scripted a world record in the arena of space.
India has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go.
And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLVs 38th successive successful launch.
This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India.
This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly.
Particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources, how this should be best put to use, what things to keep in mind in this regard.
Almost immediately after its launch, our satellite has sent back some pictures.
It has commenced functioning.
It is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISROs success.
On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO.
Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another.
One runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists, their entire team.
Shobha Ji has asked one more question and that pertains to the security of India.
In the field of defence also, India has successfully test fired the Ballistic Interceptor Missile.
During its trial, this missile, based on interceptor technology, destroyed an enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km above the surface of the earth and thus marked its success.
This is a significant, cutting edge competency in the arena of security.
When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy.
Inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development.
they begin further questioning it, look around for newer queries, and try to create new realms in the spirit of enquiry.
This incessant spirit of enquiry leads to new inventions.
They do not rest till they obtain an answer.
If we try to take a birds eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
A full-stop is impossible.
Attempting to know the universe, the laws of Nature, the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process.
This is what begets new Science, new technology.
And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in Mann Ki Baat, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase.
The country needs more and more scientists.
Todays scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations.
When Science is harnessed keeping in minds the needs of common folk, when ways and means to naturally use those principles for peoples requirements are devised, when appropriate mediums and technologies are deliberated upon, it paves the way for it to be considered the most valuable contribution for general humanity.
To give you an example, I came across an innovation for our poor fishermen brethren.
There were a large number of such innovations.
Systems are getting technology driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
Digital transactions in India are witnessing a very rapid surge.
The young generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets.
I believe this to be a good portent.
In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support.
For about two months now, everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each.
There are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each.
Shriman Santosh Ji from Mysore, expressing joy, has written on the NarendraModiApp that under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, he received a reward of a thousand rupees.
But I feel I must share with you what he has written most prominently.
Santosh Ji, your name and your deed both are sources of SANTOSH, satisfaction for all of us.
Though he continues to be a driver, in a way, he has now become an ambassador for this scheme.
He keeps imparting knowledge about digital usage to his passengers all the time. He is extremely enthusiastic and motivates others also to go digital.
One young post-graduate student Pooja Nemade from Maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using RuPay Card and e-wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her.
She has taken up this in a mission mode and is bringing others into its fold.
Take it further as it has a very major and prominent role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Babasaheb Ambedkar, a truly memorable day.
We have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Remembering him, you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the BHIM App.
Also teach them about the procedure of making transactions through this App
For this, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands.
Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our countrys economy.
Economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nations economic progress.
I wish to share a very happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries.
The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains.
All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records.
There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi.
More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
This is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers.
Thus, it is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I want to specially thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land.
This is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole-heartedly accepted my request, my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner.
And, this was not confined to having just a closed door seminar, but the importance of cleanliness was practically demonstrated at Warangal in Telangana.
Toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re-used.
They also displayed as to how convenient these new technique toilets are and there is absolutely no inconvenience or hesitation in emptying or cleaning these toilets and even the psychological barrier does not come in the way at all.
And, we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning.
For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years.
Our farmers know NPK very well.
Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight.
During the first fortnight of March, Women and Child Development Ministry along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be laying stress on the Cleanliness Campaign.
And two other ministries, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take the Cleanliness Campaign forward during the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever an Indian achieves something notable, the whole country feels a new energy and the self-confidence gets a boost.
We all hailed the commendable performance by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics.
India defeated Pakistan in the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held earlier this month to become World Champions for the second consecutive time and thus raised our national prestige to a new height.
I once again congratulate all players of our team.
The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strongly determined, courageous and possess tremendous resolve.
We get to learn something each moment from them.
Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none.
They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements.
Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently.
My heartiest congratulations to all these players.
Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement is moving forward with rapid strides.
This is no longer just a government programme. It has now become a campaign of societal empathy and public education.
During the last two years this programme involved the common man
it has forced people from all corners of the country to think and ponder over this burning issue and brought about a change in peoples thinking about our traditional beliefs and customs which have been prevalent for many years.
It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter.
In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance.
I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign.
About 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the Har Ghar Dastak programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters.
In Rajasthan Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools, who had dropped out, in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again.
New imagination and new concepts have been linked and connected with it.
This movement has been moulded as per local requirements.
You also connect actively with this programme.
I get to know so many things from you.
I get to know as to what all is happening on the ground, in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors intricately wove the annual seasonal cycle, the economy cycle and social life systems in a way that ensured, that under no circumstances, dullness crept into society.
We celebrated quite a few festivals in the days gone by.
Yesterday, Krishna- Janma Mahotsav, the festival of the birth of Lord Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Can anyone even imagine the greatness of his personality, that, even after thousands of years, the festival comes along with renewed novelty, a new inspiration with fresh energy.
although millennia ago, yet it is relevant in providing solutions to problems as well as inspiration even today.
Everyone can find solutions to present day problems from Shri Krishnas life.
Despite his myriad facets of greatness, assuming the role of a charioteer
Or running errands such as lifting a hillock, or at other times picking up leftover leaf plates One feels a sense of newness in whatever he does.
And thats why today, as I converse with you, my attention is drawn towards two Mohans.
One is the Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan and the other is the Charkha bearing Mohan.
The Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna for the sea beach of Gujarat, establishing himself in the city of Dwarika, while the Mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the Yamuna, breathing his last in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan, thousands of years ago, had amply used his wisdom, his sense of duty, his might, his worldview to avert war, to prevent conflict, a sign of the times then.
My dear countrymen, Im referring to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the 2nd of October, 1869, at the beach of Porbandar, in Kirti Mandir as it is known today,... in that tiny abode, not just a person
He served millworkers who were being underpaid.
He served the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry... he took it as lifes prime duty.
There were many myths associated with leprosy then. In order to dispel them, he closely served people suffering from leprosy.
Whoever, needed him, and wherever, Gandhiji was present to serve.
He emphasized not only on the spirit of service, but also on the inner happiness it led to.
Service as a virtue is meaningful when it is performed with a sense of joy-Seva Parmo Dharmah.
But simultaneously, deep inner joy, the essence of Swantah Sukhaayah is inbuilt in the spirit of service.
We can understand this from Bapus life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and society, human beings humanity was everything.
Whether it was the Phoenix Farm or the Tolstoy Farm in Africa, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he laid special emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way.
I have been extremely fortunate to have been blessed with the opportunity to visit a number of significant places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi and pay my homage.
I can say that Gandhi emphasized on the spirit of collectiveness through a sense of service.
Community service and community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real lives.
But should Gandhi 150 just come go
that too for the sake of enjoying that rare inner bliss, the core of Swaantah Sukhaayah.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I was in Dandi.
In the times to come, many programmes, competitions exhibitions have been planned.
In this context I feel like sharing with you something very interesting.
Of special interest were the Haripura Panels.
You may remember that in the Haripura Congress Session in Gujarat, Subhash Chandra Bose being elected as President is recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Session, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal of Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan, Nandlal Bose.
It was Gandhijis wish that the lifestyle of the people of India be depicted through the medium of art and this artwork may be exhibited during the session.
This is the same Nandlal Bose whose artwork adorns our Constitution
lends to the Constitution a new, unique identity.
The very commitment reverence of Nandlal Bose have made him, along with the Constitution, immortal.
Nandlal Bose toured villages around Haripura, concluding with a few works of art canvas, depicting glimpses of life in rural India.
This invaluable artwork was a high point of discourse at Venice.
Once again, along with greetings on Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, I express my expectations from every Indian, of one resolve or the other.
One should do something for the sake of the country, society or just for someone else.
This will be a good, true genuine Karyanjali to Bapu, a tribute through a good deed.
O glorious children of Mother India, you may remember that for the last few years, we have been running a countrywide campaign Swachchata Hi Sewa, the quest for cleanliness is service, around a couple of weeks before the 2nd of October.
This time around it will commence on the 11th of September.
This time our emphasis must be on plastic.
This campaign has enthused people from all strata of society.
Many of my merchant brothers sisters have put up a placard at their establishments, boldly mentioning that customers ought to carry shopping bags with them.
This will result in monetary savings, as well as one would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment.
This year, on the 2nd of October, when we celebrate Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we shall not only dedicate to him an India that is Open Defecation Free, but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution against plastic, by people themselves, throughout the country.
I appeal to all strata of society, residents of every village, town city, take it as a prayer with folded hands let us celebrate Gandhi Jayanti this year as a mark of our plastic free Mother India.
Let us celebrate 2nd October as a special day.
It can be recycled
it can be transformed into fuel.
And for inspiration, theres no need to look hither- tither what can be a greater inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit, epigrammatic verses are, in a way, gems of wisdom.
earlier it was frequent. Today I want to touch upon a very important point from a Sanskrit Subhashit. These lines were written centuries ago, but even today, carry great relevance.
Imprudent people call stones as gems.
In our culture much glory has been ascribed to food.
We have even converted the knowledge about food into a science.
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, more so for women and the new-born, since these two categories are the foundation of the future of our society.
People are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and interesting ways.
In this novel scheme, during the harvest period, Anganwadi workers collect a handful of rice grain from the people.
This grain is used to make piping hot food for children and women.
In this way, the person contributing the handful of grain transmutes into a conscientious civil social worker.
In the process, he gets himself dedicated to this cause and becomes a soldier of that movement.
solid and not liquid food
In 2010, Gujarat embarked upon planning to provide kids complimentary food on the occasion of 'Ann Praashan Sanskar' so that this initiative spreads awareness among the masses.
This is a great initiative that can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run meal campaigns on certain dates.
If the family celebrates a birthday, certain auspicious day or observe an in- memoriam day, then the family members with self-prepared nutritious and delicious food, go to the Anganwadis and also to the schools and these family members themselves serve the children and feed them.
There is a wonderful confluence of a sense of service and satisfaction.
My Friends, there are many little things that can be employed in our countrys effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyaan across the country.
You must get connected with it, get information about this initiative, add some new facet to Poshan Abhiyaan by contributing to it.
If you manage to save a few people from malnutrition, it would mean that we can bring the country out of the circle of malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about 'Mann ki Baat', I was sure that a lot of questions would crop up about this subject and thats what exactly happened.
In the last few weeks wherever I went and met people, 'Man vs. Wild' gets a mention
With this one episode, I have not only formed a connect with the youth around the world but I had never thought that I would find a certain place in young hearts in this way.
I had never thought that the youth of our country and the world pay attention to diverse things.
Just last week I went to Bhutan.
But these days Im experiencing something new.
and I am amazed how interested people are in nature.
It is my firm belief that people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
Was this episode edited later
Now, there is no secret in this.
Many people have this question in their minds, so I will unravel this secret.
Well, in a way it is no secret at all
So I used to speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology.
After the broadcast of this show, a large number of people have been discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit sites associated with nature and wild life and animals.
As I have said before, and I emphasize, that you must visit the north-east in your lifetime.
Your horizon will expand.
On 15th August, I urged all of you from the ramparts of the Red Fort to visit at least 15 places within a span of the next 3 years, 15 places within India and for 100 tourism, visit these 15 sites
Your life will be enriched.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing the tiger census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers there are in India
The tiger population in India is 2967, two thousand nine hundred sixty seven.
A few years ago, we were with great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present.
The Tiger summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia.
At this summit, a resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger population in the world.
It was resolved to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, where we accomplish goals in the quickest time possible.
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself.
Not only the tiger population in India was doubled, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
At the time I was releasing the data on tigers, I also remembered the Asiatic lion of the Gir in Gujarat.
I had the charge of the Chief Minister of Gujrat at a period of time when the habitat of lions in the forests of Gir was shrinking.
Their number was decreasing.
We took several innovative steps, one after the other in the Gir.
In 2007, it was decided to deploy female guards.
There were improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
But, we now have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda delivered on September 11, 1893.
This young monk of India, who shook the conscience of the human race of the entire world, imparted onto this world a glorious identity of India.
The enslaved India which was gazed at by the world in a much distorted manner was forced to change its way of looking at India due to the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let us look anew at India which Swami Vivekananda had seen and let us put in practice the inherent strength of India realized by Swami Vivekananda.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the 'Fit India Movement' across the country.
We have to keep ourselves fit and the nation has to be made fit.
It will be a very interesting campaign for everyone - children, the elderly, the young and women and it will be your own movement.
But today I am not going to reveal its specifics
you must wait for 29thAugust
And 2nd October as a day has been totally dedicated to riddance from plastic.
All of us with all our might must try to get rid of plastics from our home and everywhere outside our houses.
And I know that all these campaigns will make a big splash on social media.
Come, let us proceed with a new zeal, new resolve and renewed strength.
I will wait for your say and your suggestions.
Let us proceed, enjoying our inner bliss, expressing our spirit of service.
Many many Thanks. Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy - these in a way make Republic Day also a festival of sanskaars, which makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic responsibilities, and also imparts to them the culture, moral values and norms inherent in our democracy.
But still in our country, the duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as intensively and extensively as it should be done.
I hope that the amount of emphasis that is given to the rights at every level during most of the time, is also given to discussing duties of citizens in an emphatic manner.
The rights and duties of the citizens constitute the railway track, on which the train of democracy in India can move ahead at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
All of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland, by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th January.
As a society, as a nation, the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th January at 11 am, should become our instinctive nature.
I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
There are various categories of these gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal and Param Vishisht Seva Medal.
I want to urge the youth especially that since you are very active on social media, you can do one thing.
Surf the Net to do some research on the valiant bravehearts, who have been bestowed with these honours, compose a few good lines about them and share these with your friends and companions.
When we get to know the in depth details of their courage, bravery, valour in detail, we are filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired
While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers, I bow to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April all these are for every family, months of most severe test
Normally it is one or two children in a home due to appear at their exams, but the entire family feels the burden of it.
Troubled families, harassed students, tense teachers one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home
And I have always felt that we should come out of this situation and, therefore, today I want to talk in some detail with my young friends.
When Id declared that I would talk on this topic, many teachers, guardians and students sent me their messages, questions, suggestions and also expressed their anguish and narrated their problems. And after going through all these outpourings, some ideas came to my mind, which I want to share with you today.
I received a telephonic message from Srishti.
Well, the question has been posed by Srishti, but it is a question that must be there in the minds of all of you.
Exams in themselves, should be a joyous occasion.
After a year of hard work, one has the opportunity to display ones capabilities, so this should be a festival of joy and enthusiasm.
Now, it is up to you to decide whether you consider the exams pleasure or pressure.
And when there is a festive mood of celebration, the best within us comes out.
The true realisation of the strength of a society also takes place during festivals.
Hence, during examinations too, an atmosphere of festivity should be created in the whole family, amongst friends and around the neighbourhood.
All the family members have to work as a team and play with zeal their respective roles to make this festival of examination a success.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
It is the responsibility of each one of us that in our own ways, observing our respective traditions and in tune with our respective family surroundings, we should strive to transform every year these 3-4 months into a festival.
And therefore I shall say to you 'Smile More Score More'
And you must have noticed that when you are happy, you are smiling, you become relaxed automatically, and when you relax instinctively, youre able to recollect very old things also quite effortlessly
A year ago, what the teacher had taught in the classroom, the whole scenario reappears in front of you.
Sometimes it also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper perspective.
It seems to become a question of life and death.
See, the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year.
J.
Abdul Kalam.
He appeared at the test for recruitment into the Air Force, and failed in that.
Now suppose that this failure had caused him to become dejected, to concede defeat in his life, then would India have found such a great scientist and such a glorious President
As a result, the competition has multiplied leading to a very high increase of stress in the students also.
So I would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course.
It is the knowledge that is going to be of use to you in life, so are skill, self-confidence and determination.
All of you would have thought that as a doctor he was good, you were finding relief in his treatment and thus you started taking his services regularly.
When you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look at the mark-sheet of that lawyer
You only look at his experience, his knowledge, and the graph of his success.
And therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction.
But this also happens sometimes and if you analyse minutely the journey of your own life, you will realise that if you start running after marks, you will look for the shortest ways, and will identify a few selected things and focus on those only.
Thus, you may find that despite becoming brilliant in passing the exams, you have sometimes failed in life.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about PRATISPARDHA, meaning 'competition with others'.
It is a huge psychological battle.
Let us take the example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar.
Friends, in every field of life and when taking exams, if you were able to study peacefully for two hours earlier, then are you now able to do so for three hours
If you couldnt wake up at the decided time in the morning and were thus delayed, now can you get up early on time
Shriman S.
She would help me rectify errors.
My mother did not clear the Class 10 exam, yet without her aid, it would have been impossible for me to pass the CBSE exam.
Sunder Ji, what you say is absolutely correct.
And you must have observed today also that women are a majority amongst those who ask me questions or send in suggestions.
Once you learn to accept, maximum number of problems will be solved there and then.
Acceptance brings about new avenues in finding solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting a certain state provides us with the opportunity of opening up newer vistas.
Just accept things as they are.
You will feel much lighter.
We keep deliberating on the heavy weight of our tiny tots school bags, but there are times when I feel that expectations and aspirations on the part of parents are far too heavier compared to those school bags.
Once, many years ago, one of our acquaintances was admitted to a hospital, following a heart attack.
In a way, we terrify a patient with constant references to his ailment.
I would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same with our children.
Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams
See it for yourself, the whole ambience will be transformed.
I have received an incredible phone call.
The gentleman does not wish to reveal his name.
When you listen to the call, you will come to know why he does not want to identify himself
Namaskar, Pradhan Mantriji, I cannot divulge my name because of something that I did in my childhood.
Once, when I was young, I had made an attempt to cheat in my exams.
I tried to explore and find out various methods of copying and wasted a lot of time because of that.
I could have very well secured the same marks by devoting that time to studying, which I wasted while pondering how to copy.
Moreover, when I tried to use unfair means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me.
I am reiterating the same, once again.
Where will you reach then
It is as if you are yourself digging holes in your pathways.
And, I have seen that there are people who squander so much of their talent, invest their entire creativity in finding ingenious ways and means in designing unfair methods.
What kind of a Prime Minister is this, who is asking children to come out and play during exams, they might say
People generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in sporting activities, they become careless about their studies.
Other parts of the body too require physical activity.
If only for five minutes, give yourself a break. You will feel the onset of a certain ease in your work.
I do not know if everyone likes this or not, but I am saying it out of personal experience.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me, How many hours do you sleep
I asked him if he was a doctor.
He said, No, but it is linked with your voice problem brought on by delivering so many election speeches.
Only when you get adequate sleep, your vocal chords will be able to rest fully.
Well, I had never given a thought to a possible connection between my sleep, my speeches and my voice.
It was as if he had given me a herbal panacea.
Please, do not do that, else your family members will be displeased with me.
And when your mark sheet arrives, if they are not happy with that, they will not see you but only me.
So, avoid doing that.
This is a wonderful remedy for maintaining the vigour of the mind, brain and body.
Make headway with this Mantra.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years.
On this occasion I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the Nation.
It is a matter of pride and honour that with its indigenously built 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, it has carved a coveted place for itself amongst the 4 biggest Coast Guards of the world.
True in letter and spirit to the motto, securing the countrys maritime borders and maritime environment, the jawans of Coast Guard are relentlessly at work night and day, braving the most adverse conditions.
Last year, personnel of Coast Guard undertook a campaign of cleaning up of our coastal areas also, over and above their routine duties. Thousands participated in this campaign.
Our Coast Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that, they command Hovercrafts as well.
Vasant is RITURAJ, the king of seasons.
In our country, Saraswati Pooja is done on Vasant Panchami
It is considered an occasion to worship Vidya, knowledge.
And not just that, it is a celebration of inspiration for brave hearts.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola is a perfect example of that.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio too infuses myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination.
Last month onwards, they have started broadcasting versions in regional languages, immediately after the broadcast of my Mann Ki Baat.
This has gained wide acceptance.
People are writing in from far and wide.
I felicitate All India Radio for this self-inspired initiative from the core of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My fellow countrymen, Namaskar, many felicitations and seasons greetings to you on the occasion of Christmas.
Today is the day to give importance in our lives to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus had said - The poor do not need our favours but our acceptance with affection.
A tale associated with this incident is also very popular.
It has been mentioned in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple
many rich people came and donated bountifully
then a poor widow came and parted with only two copper coins.
Now just two copper coins really do not amount to much.
Today, 25th December, is also the birth anniversary of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviyaji, who kindled resolve and self confidence in the psyche of the Indian people and gave a new direction to modern education.
My most sincere and heartfelt tributes to Malviyaji on his birth anniversary.
About two days ago, I had the opportunity to launch many a developmental work in Banaras, the sacred workplace of Malviyaji.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in BHU at Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is going to be a boon for the people of not only eastern Uttar Pradesh but for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar also.
Today is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Venerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
This country can never forget Ataljis contributions.
Under his leadership, the country proudly grew in stature in the field of nuclear power also.
Whether in the role of a party leader, Member of Parliament, a minister or the Prime Minister, Atalji always established an ideal.
I salute Atalji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
As a party worker I had the privilege of working with Atalji.
Many memories emerge before my eyes.
This morning when I tweeted, I shared a video, in which you can see for yourself how as a small party worker one had the fortune of having affection showered upon him by Atalji.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
Everybody wants to understand and learn from each other.
To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders.
To encourage customers, the scheme is Lucky Grahak Yojana and to encourage traders the scheme is Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana.
Today, on 25th December, as a Christmas gift, fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system, whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only
starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
Everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each.
In the next 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees as gift, but you will be entitled to this gift only if you make use of mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay Card, UPI, USSD - such means and methods of digital payment.
The draw for rewards will be done based on your use of such digital payment methods.
Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is mainly for traders and businessmen.
Traders should adopt this scheme themselves and should encourage their customers too in order to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and there would be thousands of these rewards.
Those who make purchases of more than three thousand rupees will not be entitled to rewards under this scheme.
Even the poor people can use USSD on simple feature or ordinary mobile phones to buy and sell goods as well as make payments and thus all of them can also become prospective beneficiaries of this reward scheme.
In rural areas too, people can buy or sell through AEPS and they can also win rewards.
Come on, if there is a child studying in 10th or 12th standard in your family, he or she will also be able to teach you well about this.
It is as simple as sending WhatsApp messages on the mobile.
My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast.
During the past few days, the cashless transactions, or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300.
To give cashless trading a big impetus, Government of India has taken a very major decision.
The business community, our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is.
Those businessmen who adopt digital transactions, who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get Income Tax rebate.
Ive been told that Assam Government has decided to grant a 10 discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction.
The branches of Grameen, that is, Rural Banks there getting 75 of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between January and March will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government.
They have announced that under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transaction, rewards of 5 lakh rupees will be given to villages doing 100 digital transaction till 31st March, 2017.
Assam Government has decided to reward 5 thousand rupees to the first 10 farmers as Digital Krishak Shiromani, who will buy seeds and fertilizers entirely through digital payments.
I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives.
And the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of GNFC have gone up by 27 percent.
Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash.
They are paid their salaries in cash and we know that due to this, they are exploited also.
If they are to receive 100 rupees, they get only 80 rupees, if they are to be paid 80 rupees, they are given only 50 rupees. They are deprived of facilities like insurance and those associated with health sector.
But now the practice of cashless payment is being adopted the money is being directly deposited into banks.
Our country is blessed with the maximum number of young people.
Thus, we are favourably placed for using technology.
A country like India should be ahead of everybody else in this field.
Our youth have benefitted quite a lot from Start-Ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity for our youth. They should impart to this as much strength as they can with their new ideas, technology and processes.
But we must also connect with the drive to rid the country of black money and corruption with all our might.
My dear countrymen, I request every month before Mann Ki Baat that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts
The other group of correspondents have stressed that this is such a good work being carried out for the welfare of the country, such a sacred task but they have also noted that in spite of this there are many scams being committed and new avenues of dishonesty are being explored.
Shriman Gurumani Kewal has written on MyGov - This step of reigning in black money is praiseworthy.
We citizens are facing some difficulties, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are making a contribution in this fight.
We are battling corruption, black money etc on the lines of Military Forces.
The sentiment behind Gurumani Kewaljis text is being echoed in every nook and corner of the country.
All of us are experiencing it.
These people are the real Agents of Change, pioneers of transformation.
I thank people for one more reason. They have not only braved hardships, but have also powerfully given a retort to those limited few who have been trying to mislead them.
And not just that, many people came to the fore and through their creativity and intelligence, exposed the rumour mongers, brought out the falsity of the rumours and established the truth.
I salute this great ability of the people also from the core of my heart.
The people represent the will of the Almighty and their blessings become His blessings.
I thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this Mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal.
It was my earnest wish that the ongoing campaign against corruption and black money, including the realm of political parties and political funding, be discussed extensively in the Parliament.
Some people are spreading rumours that political parties enjoy all kinds of concessions.
This government is for the sake of the people.
On the other hand, as Id said earlier, on the 8th to be precise, this drive, this war is an extraordinary one.
Information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery.
And we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed.
Can anyone imagine the level of risk, which the aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements
And when we have your active support, this fight becomes much easier.
Thirdly, there is another group of letter writers, also existing in large numbers.
They say - Modiji, do not feel exhausted, do not stop and take the most stringent measures that you can.
We have to win this battle and the question of feeling exhausted or stopping simply does not arise.
We have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against Benami Property.
In the coming days, this law will also become operational.
For the benefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the people, whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority.
Recently India proudly inscribed her name in various sectors of the global economic scenario.
In the World Investment Report released by UNCTAD, Indias position has risen to third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks.
In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved up 16 rungs and in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank, we have risen by 19 ranks.
There are many reports whose evaluation indicate that India is taking rapid strides ahead.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen.
Indignation was expressed everywhere about the activities in the Parliament.
The President and Vice President also explicitly expressed their displeasure.
But even in such a situation, sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind.
Amid the din in Parliament, an excellent task was accomplished, which has not attracted due attention of the country.
Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my governments mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament.
Our government is committed to the welfare of Divyaangs.
Our efforts and our trust were fortified by our Divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the Paralympics.
With their triumph, not only did they do the Nation proud, they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess.
Our Divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage, a precious endowment, just as every citizen of the country is.
Today I am immensely delighted that the passing of this Law for the welfare of the Divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them.
In government jobs, the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4.
Special provisions have been provided for in this Law for their education, facilities and also for grievances.
The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations.
Many such new categories of Divyaangs have been included thereby providing them for the first time justice and opportunities.
For example, categories like Thalassemia, Parkinsons, or for that matter Dwarfism have been included.
My young friends, during the last few weeks, news items coming in from the world of sports have made all of us proud.
Being Indians, it is but natural for us to feel elated.
In the cricket series against England, India has triumphed 4-0.
In this, the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise.
Test captain Virat Kohli batted extremely well and also provided inspiring leadership.
My heartiest congratulations and many good wishes go to all of them.
After a gap of 15 years, there was good news, in fact grand news from the hockey arena too.
Heartiest congratulations to these young players for this grand feat.
This achievement is a very good omen for the future of our Hockey team.
Last month our Women players too won laurels.
Indian Womens Hockey Team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago in the under-18 Asia Cup, Indian Womens Hockey Team secured the Bronze Medal.
I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen, may 2017 be a year full of joy and enthusiasm
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, all of us were celebrating Diwali.
Like every year, this Diwali too, I had gone to the border, to the China border, to celebrate the occasion with our soldiers, our jawans.
I celebrated Diwali with ITBP men and army jawans on the lofty heights of the Himalayas.
I do it every time, but this Diwali was an entirely different experience.
They appeared charged with emotions, and not just that, the act of our countrymen of sending greeting messages, including the defence forces of the nation in their rejoicing had elicited a wonderful response.
And when I saw those letters, I used to be amazed at the magnitude of creativity and emotions behind this endeavour.
But, to tell you the truth, this time we did not feel so.
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions
I appeal to you that we should make it our nature, our characteristic as a society, as a Nation that whether it be a celebration of a festival or any joyous occasion, we should keep the soldiers, the jawans of the military of our nation in our hearts and minds.
When the entire nation stands by the armed forces, their might mutiplies a hundred and twenty five crore times.
A few days ago, all Pradhans from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to see me.
They were from the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They had come from different villages of the Kashmir valley, there were around 40-50 Pradhans.
They had come to discuss a few points on the development of their villages
they had some demands. But when the deliberations began, issues such as conditions in the valley, the law and order situation, the future of children came up in a natural manner.
Recently, just a few days ago, when the Board examinations were held, 95 of the sons and daughters of Kashmir, the young students appeared in the examinations.
The sheer volume of students, who appeared in the Board Examinations, is a clear indication that our children from Jammu Kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress, to build a bright future through the medium of education.
For their resolute zeal I congratulate these students and I also felicitate their parents, their kith and kin, their teachers and all the Gram Pradhans as well from the depths of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann ki Baat, I can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme.
Everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 1000 rupee notes.
On the 8th of November at 8 in the evening, in my Address to the Nation, I had talked about launching a mega campaign to bring about reforms in the country.
When I had taken this decision and presented it before you, then also I had said openly that it was not an ordinary decision, it was one fraught with difficulties.
And I had stated then also that this decision was so enormous that it would take us at least 50 days to come out of its after effects and only then would we be able to move towards normalcy.
These maladies have been afflicting us for the past 70 years and the campaign for getting rid of these can never be an easy task.
However, India has nothing but faith and faith only and supreme confidence in her hundred and twenty five crore countrymen that they will certainly fulfill their resolve.
And I have seen that in the midst of such difficulties, all personnel of banks and post offices are working very hard.
And when it comes to the practice of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that in Khandwa, an old gentleman met with an accident.
This came to the knowledge of local bank personnel, and I was happy to learn that they personally carried and handed over cash at his home, for help in treatment.
Innumerable such incidents come to light everyday through television, media, newspapers and mutual conversations.
They seek illegal means to save their ill-gotten wealth.
but, for Gods sake, please do not play with the lives of poor people.
Do not do anything that may bring the names of the poor on record for wrong reasons and land my dear poor people into trouble during the investigation later on account of your foul deeds.
And the law regarding Benami property that has been enacted and is being implemented is very stringent and it is going to be extremely tough on wrong doers.
I am an ordinary citizen of Village Tiraali of Tehsil Tiraali in District Harda of Madhya Pradesh.
Your move to demonetize 1000 and 500 rupee notes is a commendable step.
I wish that in Mann Ki Baat, you quote instances of people, who, despite facing hardships, have welcomed this step for the nations progress.
I want to thank you wholeheartedly because you had said that good days will come, but nobody had ever thought that you would take such a big step.
You have taught a lesson to black money mongers and the corrupt through the demonetization of 1000 and 500 rupee notes.
For each and every citizen of India there could be no better days than these.
For this I thank you from the core of my heart.
We get to know certain things through media, through the people and through government sources which add to our enthusiasm for work.
So people go and eat there and make payments on their next visit after 2, 4 or 6 days.
This is the strength of my country which encompasses the spirit of service, of sacrifice and also of genuineness and honesty.
During elections, I used to have , that is discussions over tea and this got publicised around the whole world.
People in many countries of the world even learnt to utter the phrase Chai Par Charcha.
But, I did not know Chai Par Charcha could be linked to a marriage also.
I learnt that on 17th November, a marriage was solemnised with Chai Par Charcha in Surat.
One daughter at Surat in Gujarat served only tea to all the guests who had come to her wedding. There was no big function, no feast or banquet because there was a shortage of cash due to demonetisation.
Bharat Maaroo and Dakshaa Parmar from Surat, through their marriage, have made a valuable contribution in the ongoing fight against corruption and black money and set up a very inspiring example.
I once saw in the news on TV, when I had returned late in the night, a report about a small village called Dhekiajulli () in Assam, where tea workers reside.
These tea workers get their wages on weekly basis.
Four women from the neighborhood got together and jointly made purchases and made the payment with the 2000 Rupee note
Now all of us know very well that the poor people always like to clear their dues 2-3 days in advance.
All municipalities receive hardly 50 of their tax revenues.
But, this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant, people rushed to deposit their old currency notes.
5 thousand crore rupees in taxes last year. You will be surprised and also happy to know that during this one week, these institutions received 13 thousand crore rupees. Imagine the difference - from 3 to 3.
Many such examples are coming to light where direct benefits of this demonetisation can clearly be seen.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are strong pillars of our economy.
Every citizen is making requisite adjustments amidst the difficulties as a result of the new changes. But, I especially wish to compliment the farmers of our country.
I was just gathering data of the sowing of this crop season.
I am glad that be it wheat, be it pulses, be it oilseeds, the data received till 20th November indicates that sowing has increased substantially as compared to sowing during the last year.
Our farmers have discovered new avenues amidst the present difficulties.
The government has also taken many important decisions, wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages.
Small traders and businessmen of our country provide employment opportunities besides adding to the economic activities.
In the last budget we had taken an important decision that just like the big malls, small shopkeepers in the villages will also be allowed to operate round the clock and no rule will stop them from doing so because I felt that when the big malls can function 24 hours, why the poor village-shopkeepers should not get the same facility
A number of initiatives were taken to grant them loans under Mudra Yojana.
These small traders were provided loans worth lakhs and crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana because there are crores of such small traders and they impart momentum to the business activities worth billions of rupees.
But naturally they too had to face difficulties due to this decision.
You too download Apps of Banks on your mobile phones.
You too keep a POS machine for transactions in Credit Cards. You too learn to do cashless business.
You can see how the big malls are expanding their business with the help of latest technology.
A small trader can also expand the business with the help of this user friendly technology.
There is no possibility of things going wrong, but there certainly is an opportunity to grow.
I invite you all. You can make a very big contribution in creating a cashless society.
You can create a full-fledged banking facility on your mobile phone and there are many ways now to run our business without using paper currency.
There are technological methods which are safe, secure and instantaneous.
I want that you not only extend your cooperation in making this campaign successful but also lead the process of transformation and I have full confidence that you can be the leader for this change.
I am sure you can handle the entire business in your village using this technology.
I want to tell my worker brothers and sisters too that you have faced heavy exploitation.
Wages shown on paper are much higher than the wages actually paid to you.
If sometimes full wages are paid, someone stands outside to forcibly take his cut and the worker is compelled to accept this as his fate.
We want that under this new system you should have a bank account your wages should be deposited directly into your bank so that payment of minimum wages is ensured.
You get your due wages in full, without anybody extracting a cut.
I specially want to talk to our young friends today.
We keep telling with great fanfare the whole world that India is a country where 65 of the population is below the age of 35 years.
I know, dear young men and women of my country, that you have liked my decision.
I also know that you support my decision.
I even know that you are making a big contribution in positively taking this mission forward.
But dear friends, you are my true soldiers, my true partners.
Dear youngsters, can you please help me
You will be with me but that alone is not enough.
The older generation does not have the exposure and experience of the new world which you possess.
Possibly your elder brother and even your parents and uncles and aunts also may not know.
You know what an App is, what online banking is and how online ticket booking is done.
For you these are routine things and you also make use of them.
But, the great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a Cashless Society.
It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
Once we embark on our journey to create a less-cash society, the goal of cashless society will not remain very far.
And I require your physical help, your own time, your own resolve and I am sure that you will not disappoint me because we are the ones nurturing the desire to change for better the life of the poor people of India.
You know how many opportunities there are today for a cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online banking facility.
Every bank in India has its own mobile App.
Every bank has its wallet.
Wallet simply means an e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have Rupay Cards.
Used scarcely earlier, after 8th November the poor people have started using Rupay Cards and this usage has seen almost 300 surge.
Just as there is a prepaid card for mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available in banks to facilitate expenditure.
And, this procedure is as simple as sending messages through WhatsApp.
Cash can be transferred even with a phone with ordinary features.
A washerman, vegetable vendor, milk supplier, newspaper vendor, tea stall owner or a chanaa vendor, everyone can easily use this facility.
I have provided further impetus to simplifying this system even more.
All banks are engaged in this and are doing their best.
My dear young friends, despite all these things, there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters.
And I know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task.
The kind of creative messages that you send on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, anecdotes, cartoons, new imagination, jokes I am seeing all these signifying the creative power of our young generation amidst the present challenges. This is the speciality of our Bharat Bhoomi, our motherland where GITA was created on a battlefield.
Today when we are passing through the times of such gigantic changes, your original creativity is manifesting itself within you.
But, my dear young friends, I once again tell you that I need your help in this task.
You just do one thing, take a resolve today itself that you will yourself become a part of the cashless society.
Every technology needed for online spending will definitely be available on your mobile phone.
But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from ones account, how to make payment to shopkeepers.
Also teach the shopkeepers to conduct their business with this technology.
You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a cashless society, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems.
I invite you come, do not just support this transformation but become one of its leading soldiers and ensure that we achieve the desired transformation.
We shall carry forward this struggle to free our country from the evils of corruption and black money. There are many countries in the world where the youth have changed the nations life and it has to be accepted that it is the youth which brings about the great changes, which creates revolutions.
Kenya made a resolve and set up a mobile based system M-PESA, adopted appropriate technology which was named M-PESA and today in Kenya, in this region of Africa, total business is ready to shift to this system.
That country has brought about a big revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again earnestly appeal to you to take forward this campaign.
I invite you to work for this mission individually and collectively in every school, in every college, in every university, in NCC and in NSS.
You must have noticed, that Amitabh Ji, the most popular actor of this century, has been whole-heartedly promoting the campaign for cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now your views and your sentiments on Mann Ki Baat though your letters, on MyGov, on NaarendraModiApp keep me constantly connected with you.
Presently Mann Ki Baat is broadcast at 11 AM but we are going to start its broadcast in regional languages immediately after my Hindi broadcast.
I am grateful to Akashvani for taking up this initiative which will definitely provide an opportunity to connect our countrymen even in those areas, where Hindi language is not prevalent.
Many thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, my heartiest and best Deepawali wishes to all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout our country.
In India almost on all 365 days of the year, one festival or the other is celebrated in some part of the country.
And, the transformations in the manner of celebrating these festivals according to changing times and changing social mores have been accepted and adopted very naturally.
However, we can very well discern one characteristic that this entire journey of Indian festivals, its widespread effect, its depth, its reach to each individual are all interlinked with one spirit which exhorts evolution from the self to the whole, the collective existence.
The idea is that there should be a development of individuals and their personalities, the limited scope of thinking must expand and cover not only the whole society but, in fact, the whole universe.
And this is achieved through these festivals.
Indian festivals at times appear like community feasts but in that also the consciousness has been to there as to what should be or should not be eaten during that particular season.
What crop has been harvested by the farmers and how that yield is to be made a part of the festivities, what food habits will be appropriate in a particular season from the health point of view. Our ancestors had very scientifically encompassed all these aspects in our festivals.
Today, the whole world is talking about the environment.
Destruction of nature is a matter of great concern.
Indias tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual, right from childhood, as a cultured person.
And science has proved that on these days changes take place impacting the sea-water other factors affect nature and these also influence the human mind.
Thus we had developed the tradition to observe our holidays also intertwined with the phenomena of the Universe keeping the scientific aspects in focus.
Now when we celebrate Diwali, as I said, each of our festivals carries a message and teaches us something.
The festival of lights Deepawali conveys the message of TAMSO MA JYOTIRGAMAYA, to move from darkness to light.
By lighting lamps on Diwali, we try to overcome the darkness of these social shortcomings and individual blemishes attaining freedom from this darkness is the real essence of the festival of lights Deepawali, which we celebrate by lighting an earthen lamp, a diya.
One thing that all of us know very well is that wherever in India we go, whether to the home of the richest of the rich or to the humble dwelling of the poorest of the poor, during the Diwali festival we can see a cleanliness campaign going on in every household.
Every nook and corner of the house is cleaned.
Many Governments in the world, their Parliaments and also their ruling classes are joining Deepawali festivities.
The Prime Minister of Singapore has posted a picture on Instagram and has shared it proudly with the whole world.
It shows 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament standing outside the Parliament all clad in Indian Sarees and this photo has gone viral.
All this has been done on the occasion of Deepawali.
In Singapore, Diwali celebrations are in full swing in almost all neighbourhoods.
What I mean to say is that the festival of lights, Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration for the world community also to move from darkness to light.
News of such mishaps, fire breakouts and even tragic casualties become a cause of big concern on Deepawali.
To add to these woes, there is a situation of even the doctors in big numbers being unavailable as they too are away celebrating Deepawali with their families.
With a string of festive events such as Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj, Laabh Panchmi till Kartik Purnima this festival of lights goes on for quite a long period of time.
It is a big occasion there which lasts for four days.
But this also has a unique significance in that it gives a very special message to society.
But the adage is that people only pray to the rising sun.
However, during the Chhathh Pooja, people worship the setting Sun as well.
There is a very profound social message behind this tradition.
When I speak of the Deepawali festival or about the Chhathh Pooja this is actually an occasion to convey my best wishes to you. But, there is one more thing I have to do.
In the backdrop of the disturbing incidents taking place during the past few months, the soldiers of our defence forces have been sacrificing their all for our peace and happiness.
The sacrifice, devotion and zeal of the Jawans of our security forces occupies my mind and heart, my emotional universe all the time.
And from that emanated my feeling and resolve that this Diwali must be dedicated to our security forces.
I invited my countrymen to join the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign.
And today, in all humility, I wish to proclaim that there would not be a single soul in India who would not have unbounded love for our Jawans, a sense of deep pride in the members of our security forces.
The way these sentiments have been expressed is surely giving strength to each of our countrymen.
Your messages to the Jawans of our security forces have proved to be a great morale booster which cannot be easily imagined.
Our Jawans from BSF, CRPF, Indo Tibetan Border Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard and many more as I am not able to include all by names are valiantly facing great hardships in the line of duty.
While we are celebrating Diwali in the comforts of our homes, some of these Jawans are deployed in the desert areas, others are guarding the towering Himalayan peaks, some are guarding our industrial establishments and some are maintaining security vigil at the airports.
I earnestly express my gratitude to all our countrymen and women for this gesture.
Those who are artistically talented, have expressed themselves through their art. Some persons prepared drawings, made Rangolis, drew cartoons.
I can imagine how proud our soldiers feel at this moment.
Many messages and other expression forms have been received on Sandesh to Soldiers hashtag.
As a symbol of these, I would like to read a poem which has been sent by Shriman Ashwani Kumar.
Ashwani ji has written: I celebrate the festival, feel happy and smileI celebrate the festival, fee happy and smileAll this is because you are there,I want to tell you today that you are the guardian of my freedom,My gift of joy is there just because you are thereI sleep peacefully
My dear countrymen, sister Shivani, whose parental side of the family as well as her family on the side of her in- laws is full of army soldiers, has sent me a telephone message.
Lets hear what this representative of a military family says:Hello Mr. Prime Minister, I am Shivani Mohan calling.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
Im from an Army family.
My husband is an Army officer.
My Father and Father-in-law both served as Army Officers also.
Our Soldiers and Officers who are guarding our border have been receiving these affectionate messages and all in the Army circle are getting tremendous inspiration and encouragement.
I would also like to say that along with Army Officers and soldiers their families and their wives also make sacrifices.
My fellow citizens, it is true that military personnel guard not only our borders, but they stand as sentinels and fighters on every front of life.
Be it a calamitous natural disaster or a law and order crisis or having to deal with enemies or to display courage in motivating misguided youth to return to the mainstream of life, Our Jawans are motivated by a sense of patriotism while rendering service to the nation.
And he found that some of the families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of funds.
Vikas Thakur demonstrated his heroics by contributing one thousand rupees each from his pocket to the 57 families and thus strengthening the Cleanliness Campaign.
And that is how Himachal Pradesh has been empowered to become an Open Defecation Free state.
It is rarely visited by people.
The building material needed to construct the toilets whether it was bricks or cement, the entire construction material was carried by the young men on their shoulders, spending an entire day walking in those forests.
The Municipal Councils and Corporations in Gujarat, numbering over 150 have been declared free from open defecation.
10 districts have also been declared free of open defecation.
My fellow citizens, the government plans for the welfare of the people through many of its schemes, and usually when the second scheme follows the first one then the previous scheme is supposed to be discontinued.
But generally due attention is not paid to this.
Now in our country houses having a gas stove, or those having electricity in the houses do not have a requirement for Kerosene.
But who bothers about such things in the government
And so far Ive heard that Haryana has managed to make seven or eight districts absolutely Kerosene free.
And with the pace at which this job has been undertaken, I believe that the entire state will soon be completely Kerosene free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is our guide forever.
Even today, his words guide us in setting up the standards and determining the direction that our nation must follow.
Gandhiji used to say that when you chalk out a plan, you must first recall the face of the poor and weak and then decide whether the scheme you are going to be implementing will be of any benefit to the poor or not, it should not bring any loss to him
We have to help them in getting freed from their troubles in a stepwise manner.
Whatever the old dogmatic thinking might have been, but the society now must be freed from discrimination between our sons and daughters.
For our daughters this is the opportunity to experience an India free from discrimination.
The government undertakes massive immunization programs for our children and yet millions of children are still left out from being immunized and fall prey to diseases.
Mission Indradhanush is one such operation that involves a vaccination program covering those kids who got left out during previous immunization campaigns and empowers them with immunity against serious diseases.
In the twenty-first century, having darkness still prevailing in our villages is something that is not acceptable now.
And the rural electrification drive to free the villages of darkness, this major campaign of electrification is proceeding successfully
in fact it is proceeding as per the time-schedule
We are trying to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore such families and we are successfully advancing in that direction.
The small trader, the small businessman, the vegetable vendor, the milk vendor, the one running a hair cutting salon has always been entrapped in the grip of the money lender, repaying interest all his life.
The stand up scheme and Jan Dhan account scheme are aimed at freeing these people from the clutches of notorious moneylenders.
Crediting money directly into bank accounts via Aadhar aims at directly sending money to the beneficiaries.
For the common man this is an opportunity to come out of the grip of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great son of India who vowed to unite India and made this the sole object of his life.
On the one hand, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the living legend of national unity and on the other this is also the death anniversary of Smt.
Sir, as you know, 31st October is Sardar Patel jis birthday.
Sardar Patel is the great personality who devoted his whole life to unite the country and, I think, he succeeded fully in this mission of his, he brought everybody together.
But we may call it the countrys misfortune that on this day itself Indira Gandhi ji was assassinated.
And, as we all know, what terrible events took place after her assassination.
Sir, I want to know how we can check such unfortunate events and incidents from taking place.
My dear countrymen, this is not the pain of an individual person.
One Sardar, as history goes, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the second great man after Chanakya who carried on the stupendous job of uniting our country.
But the pain remains that Sardar Patel, who lived for Indias unity, strove tirelessly for it, had to even endure some unpleasantness on account of it, but never ever abandoned the path of unity
but on the birth anniversary of this great SARDAR, thousands of Sardars, the family members of thousands of Sardars were killed in the aftermath of the assassination of Smt. Gandhi.
These atrocities against Sardars on the birth anniversary of that great personality who lived for unity, that SARDAR, is a page of history, which causes pain to all of us.
But amidst all these turmoils, we have to march forward chanting the Mantra of Unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of our country.
Different languages, different castes, different attires, different food habits and despite all these, unity in diversity remains our binding strength. That is Indias great characteristic quality.
Each generation has this responsibility, the governments have this responsibility to explore possibilities of integration in each corner of the country and highlight the elements of our integration.
We should keep away from the idea of separatism or the attitude of separatism and also guard the country from any such ideology.
Sardar Saheb gave us one India, now this is our collective responsibility to develop a Great India, a Shreshtha Bharat.
The Mantra of national unity is the very foundation of a strong and great India.
Today, we often hear the name AMUL.
People of India and even those in other countries are familiar with every product of AMUL.
But, only a few people would know that it was only through his farsightedness that Sardar Saheb envisioned the creation of a Cooperative Milk Producers Union in Khera district, which was at that time called Kaira district.
He had given this idea in 1942 which now is before us in the shape of AMUL. It is a living example as to how Sardar Saheb had foreseen the way to prosperity of the farmers.
I pay my respectful homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on 31st October, on National Unity Day, we must remember Sardar Saheb wherever we may be and take a resolve to preserve national unity.
My dear countrymen, during Diwali festivities, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of lights called PRAKASH UTSAV.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and blessings are very relevant even now and are a source of inspiration for humanity as a whole.
Service, truth and everybodys well-being was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony were his principal teachings.
Every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev preached that a campaign should be carried on to abolish superstitions, social disparities and social evils from the society.
I pay my deeply felt respectful homage to Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of the forthcoming Prakashotsav.
My dear countrymen, once again let us dedicate this Diwali to our Jawans. My best wishes and greetings on Diwali to all of you.
I wish that all your dreams and resolves get fulfilled in every possible way
May your lives be blessed with success and happiness.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
And, therefore, I will just reiterate to you, my countrymen, what I had said that very day, that the guilty will certainly be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
We are proud of our army.
I also wish today to specially talk to those living in Kashmir.
Kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti-national forces.
And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace.
Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest.
Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country.
And during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development.
We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations.
I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities, power, laws, rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of Kashmir.
At times, people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas.
These days I get to learn quite a lot through social media.
I get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy.
Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought.
He has written I was very much distressed after the Uri attack and strongly felt like doing something.
So, I was trying to find some way to be of some service to the nation.
And I have resolved that I would devote three more hours daily towards my studies.
I shall become a capable citizen so that I can serve the country well.
Brother Harshvardhan, I am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger, you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age.
Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism.
During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work, whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement.
Now, if all of us, that is, our armed forces, people in the government, fulfill our respective responsibilities sincerely, and all of us countrymen, each citizen make some constructive contribution imbued with the feeling of patriotism, our country will most definitely scale greater heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
S.
Kartik has written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes who participated in the Paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit.
Not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the Paralympics.
Perhaps going beyond sporting achievements, these Paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity, towards specially-abled, DIVYANG people.
And, I shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had to say.
When the medal was awarded to her, she said Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.
There is great strength in this remark.
This time 19 athletes, including three women, took part in Paralympics from our country.
Compared to normal sporting activities, when the DIVYANG play, in addition to physical ability and sporting skills, what are needed even more are will power and resolve.
You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that our sportspersons put up their best ever performance this time and won 4 medals including two gold, one silver and one bronze.
Brother Devendra Jhajharia won the gold medal in Javelin throw and repeated his gold winning performance after 12 years.
One gets older over a period of 12 years and after having won the gold medal once, the passion for the same is also somewhat reduced.
Yet, Devendra displayed that physical condition and increasing age could not dent his strong determination and he successfully claimed his second gold medal after a gap of 12 years.
And, he was not born a DIVYANG.
He lost one of his hands due to suffering electric current shock.
Just think about the perseverance and the huge effort put in by him in repeating the feat of winning a second gold medal at 35 years of age 12 years after winning the first one at 23.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in High Jump.
Thangavelu had lost his right leg when he was just 5.
Even poverty could not come in the way of his resolve.
He is not from a big city, he does not come from a middle class or rich family.
Yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges, at the age of 21, through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country.
As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump.
Medals in Paralympics have a significance of their own, but going beyond that these medals have made a very big contribution in transforming the attitude towards our DIVYANG brothers and sisters in our country, our society and our neighborhoods.
Only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these DIVYANG people in the Paralympics this time.
Olympic Games were held at the same venue only a few days ago.
Not only this, what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete, who finished fourth in this event amongst DIVYANG persons and thus missed winning any medal, actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race.
I once again congratulate all our Paralympic athletes and India is progressing in the direction of preparing an effective plan for developing our athletes and also the facilities for the Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
Government of India had organized a Mega Camp for DIVYANG persons and a number of world records were established that day.
A visually challenged little girl child Gauri Shardul, hailing from far flung forest area in the Dang District, can recite the complete Ramayana epic as she has learnt it by heart.
Government of India created a world record in Navsari which I believe to be very important.
The task of fitting hearing aids to 600 hearing impaired DIVYANG people in just eight hours was completed successfully.
This deed found a mention in Guinness Book of World Records.
Three world records in a single day by DIVYANG people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we had launched Swachha Bharat Mission two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu.
That day too I had said that cleanliness should become our nature, a duty for every citizen and there should be an atmosphere harbouring a sense of revulsion against filth.
Now it is going to be nearly two years on 2nd October and I can confidently say that one hundred and twenty five crore people of the country have now become more aware about cleanliness.
I had said one step towards cleanliness and today we can say that each one of us has definitely tried to take one step further.
This means that the country has taken 125 crore steps in the direction of achieving cleanliness.
Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role.
I also know that we still have to go much farther.
From the point of view of sanitation and keeping in mind the dignity of our citizens, especially the dignity of our mothers and sisters, it is necessary to put an end to the habit of defecating in the open.
And, with this in view Open Defecation Free or ODF Campaign has been launched.
I visited Gujarat recently and the officers there informed me that Porbandar, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the target of total ODF on 2nd October, 2016.
My congratulations to those who have made it possible, and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target.
I appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children, our country needs to get rid of this scourge.
Let us forge ahead with a strong resolution.
I specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy.
Every citizen has a right to know about the status of the cleanliness mission in his city and the Government of India has provided a dedicated telephone number 1969 for this purpose.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated his birth centenary and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet.
especially the younger generation must utilize it optimally.
Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour. They can sponsor young professionals willing to work for Swachchhata Mission.
They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
It is, therefore, imperative that we need to move towards Waste to Compost along with the Cleanliness Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost made out of waste.
They should supply this to the farmers who are willing to adopt organic farming.
This should also be supplied to those farmers who care about the health of their soil and are willing to improve its quality and also to those farmers whose soil quality has deteriorated because of over use of chemical fertilizers.
And for this, Shrimaan Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a significant contribution as a brand ambassador.
And I see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in.
I recently read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University launched a Jagran Abhiyan (Awereness Campaign) to build toilets in 107 villages.
Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments.
Each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days.
I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes.
Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh.
Each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that, well, we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time.
In this manner an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created.
I expect that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in the cleanliness mission.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Swachchh Bharat Mission is completing two years on this day.
I keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This year also I request that each family should buy one or the other khadi item so that the poor may also be able to light an earthen lamp and celebrate Diwali.
This year 2nd October is a Sunday so can we involve ourselves in the cleanliness mission in some way
You involve yourself physically for 2 hours, 4 hours with cleaning work and I request you to share your cleanliness drive photo on NarendraModiApp.
If it is a video, then share the video.
You will see that with our joint efforts, this movement will get a fresh boost, a new dynamism.
Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, one gets a special pleasure in giving, one may not realize it, but the pleasure of giving is divine.
I witnessed it some time back when I asked the countrymen to give up their cooking gas subsidy and they responded whole-heartedly. This in itself was a very inspirational event in Indias national life.
Now, many youngsters, small groups, people from the corporate world, schools and some NGOs are jointly going to organize Joy of Giving Week from 2nd October to 8th October.
Under this campaign, food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to walk the streets seeking donations of old toys from families and then presented these toys to Anganwadis in poor neighbourhoods.
These toys provided great pleasure to the poor children, which was a great sight to behold.
I feel that we should encourage and help these young people who are organising Joy of Giving Week in many cities.
This is a kind of a Donation Festival, a Daan Utsav.
I convey my best wishes to all those young persons who are undertaking this mission.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji and his birth centenary year commences from today.
How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development
Work for every hand, water to every field through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda.
The country should celebrate his centenary year as GARIB KALYAN VARSH, Year for Welfare of the Poor.
We can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
And this common man, who occupies my mind all the time, always gets projected in Mann Ki Baat.
On completion of two years of Mann Ki Baat this week, I wish to express my sincere gratitude from the core of my heart to all you listeners who appreciated it, who contributed to improving it and thus blessed me.
I am grateful to All India Radio also which not only broadcast my views but also put in their best efforts to transmit it in all languages.
I am also thankful to those countrymen who knocked on the doors of the government by writing letters and by sending in suggestions and highlighting shortcomings of the government and All India Radio mounted special programmes on these letters by inviting concerned government functionaries and thus provided a platform to address the problems.
Thus, Mann Ki Baat became a new opportunity of social transformation rather than just remaining a mere talk show of 15-20 minutes.
What can be more satisfying than this for any one
And therefore, I thank everyone and express my gratitude to all who contributed in making it a successful programme.
My dear countrymen, from next week festive season will be ushered in with Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, preparations for Deepavali and all such activities.
Be it Navratri or Durga Puja how can this SHAKTI-UPASANA become the festival of celebrating social unity
How to make it a festival of social bonding
And that would be the true prayer to Shakti, only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory.
Let us bow before Shakti, nurture it, march forward with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar,Tomorrow, 29th August is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand.
This occasion is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I offer my tributes to Dhyan Chand ji and wish to remind you all about his invaluable contribution.
He played a pivotal role in helping India win Hockey Gold Medals in Olympic Games of 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us cricket lovers know Bradmans name very well.
He had complimented Dhyan Chand ji by saying that he scores goals like runs.
Dhyan Chand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and nationalism.
During a match in Kolkata one player from the opposite team hit him on the head with the hockey stick.
At that point, only 10 minutes were left in the game.
And, Dhyan Chand ji scored three goals in just those ten minutes and said I avenged the hit by scoring goals.
Dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat draws near, a very large number of suggestions are received on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
One Shri Ajit Singh ji has written on NarendraModiApp Please, this time in Mann Ki Baat do talk about the education of our daughters, our Betis and their participation in sports because they have brought laurels for the country by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.
One Shri Sachin has written to urge that in Mann Ki Baat this time a mention may please be made about Sindhu, Saakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
One of these daughters is from North India while there is one who belongs to South India and then there is one from the Eastern part.
It seems that our daughters in the whole of India have decided to take up the responsibility of bringing glory to the nation.
Shikhar Thakur has written on MyGov that we could have performed better at the Olympics.
He has written Respected Modi Sir, first of all, congratulations on our winning two medals at Rio.
However, I want to draw your attention to the question was our performance really good
And, the answer is No.
And, no one can do this better than you.
Similarly, one Shri Satya Prakash Mehra ji has written on NarednraModiApp In Mann Ki Baat, there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities, especially on encouraging children and youth to play.
Thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments.
There is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations.
Some of our players could not even touch during these Games their own performance level which they had achieved during the domestic events in India.
In the medals chart, our tally was only two medals.
However, it is also a fact that if we look closely, we shall find that despite missing medals, Indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events.
See, our Abhinav Bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in Shooting.
Dipa Karmakar produced a superb performance in Gymnastics, although she remained at the fourth place and missed a Bronze by a very narrow margin.
But, how can we forget that she is Indias first daughter to qualify in Gymnastics for the Olympics and also to reach the final round.
The pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna met almost a similar fate in Tennis.
Our athletes this time gave a creditable performance.
Ushas feat, Lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the quarter finals in Boxing but could not win Bronze.
Many players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das gave a very good performance.
But my dear countrymen, we do have to go a long way.
And if we stick to the same routine, we may perhaps keep facing the same disappointment.
I have announced setting up of a committee.
The Government of India will make an in depth in-house analysis and will study the practices being followed around the world.
We shall prepare a roadmap on how we can do better.
We have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the Olympics in 2020, 2024, 2028.
I urge the State Governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports.
I urge our sports associations also to do objective and impartial brainstorming on this.
State governments too should deliberate on this matter and provide their suggestions.
But, we must prepare ourselves fully and thoroughly. And, I am confident that we, the nation of 125 crore people comprising 65 percent youth population can reach an exalted status in the world of sports too. We have to move ahead with this resolve.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
For many years, I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers Day and that too as a student myself.
I used to learn quite a lot from those young children.
For me, 5th September was Teachers Day as well as an Education Day.
But, this time I have to leave for G-20 Summit and so felt in my heart that I should express my feelings in this regard in Mann Ki Baat today.
In our life, a teacher holds the same place which a mother does.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopi Chand ji is being talked about everywhere.
He is a player first but he has set up a glorious example of what a good coach, that is, a teacher should be.
I see Gopi Chand ji today as an excellent teacher besides being a very accomplished player.
And, on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopi Chand ji for his hard work, his dedication towards sports and his manner of finding happiness in the success of his disciples.
We always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives.
5th September happens to be the birthday of Indias former President Dr.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this as Teachers Day.
Whatever post he held in his life, he always tried to live like a teacher, an educator.
Not only this, he always said that a good teacher can only be one who keeps the student within always alive.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji showed this by living as a teacher and by keeping alive the student within him despite holding the highest office of the President.
Some times when I think of it, I remember so many incidents related with my teachers because they were our heroes in our small village.
However, I can happily say that even now I receive a hand written letter every month from one of my teachers, who has turned 90 now.
If you have a photograph with your teacher or an incident connected with your teacher or an inspirational thing associated with your teacher, please do share the same on NarendraModiApp.
Looking at the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of students is also immensely valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is drawing near.
Ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country, our society, our families, and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles.
But, when we mention Ganesh Utsav, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public celebration of Ganesh Utsav is Lokmanya Tilaks gift to us.
By publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav, he turned this religious occasion into a festival of national awakening and social refinement.
These Ganesh festivities included holding wide-ranging discussions on the issues that touched our lives and society, and comprised such programmes which provided a new vigour and vitality to our social fabric.
Also, his mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is my birthright should have the main focus thereby strengthening the freedom movement.
Now, not in Maharashtra alone but in each corner of India, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated publicly.
Young people make elaborate preparations, they are full of vigour.
Some people even now try to follow the path shown by Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They organise debates on topics of public interest, and hold essay competitions and rangoli competitions.
Tableus depict the issues of social concern in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a mass campaign of public education gets underway through these Ganesh festivities.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is our birthright.
But now we live in independent India.
So do we through these public Ganesh festivals move now to SURAAJ, that is, good governance by proclaiming SURAAJ is my birthright.
Good governance, SURAAJ, should be our priority
can we not recite this mantra and give a message for it in the public Ganesh festival celebrations
Come on, I invite you all.
Life seems to be impossible without festivals but these have to be moulded according to the needs of the changing times.
I have seen that this time, many people have written to me mentioning Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
They are worried about environment.
One Shri Shankar Narayan Prashant has strongly urged Modi ji, kindly tell the people through your Mann Ki Baat that they should not use Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris. Why should we not use Ganeshji idols made of the clay from the village pond.
This will help in environment preservation, prevent pollution of our rivers and ponds and also provide protection to small creatures living in water. This is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji removes obstacles.
So, we should not make such Ganeshji idols, which create problems.
I do not know how you will take my suggestions but it is not just me but many other people saying the same thing.
Eco-friendly Ganeshotsav is also social service.
There is still time left before the start of Durga Pooja festivities.
If we resolve now, our efforts will lead to employment generation for those families which traditionally used to make clay idols in the past.
Also the clay will go back and get dissolved in the pond or the river and will thus help in protecting the environment.
I offer my best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be canonized, that is, accorded sainthood on 4th September.
Mother Teresa devoted her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
When Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India all through her life, is accorded Sainthood, it is quite natural for we Indians to feel proud.
Indian government will send an official delegation under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to represent 125 crore Indians at the canonization ceremony to be held on 4th September.
We keep learning something or the other from great men and women, saints, sages, holy people.
We shall continue to receive something, learn something from them and keep on doing some good things.
Peoples power is, in a way, considered to be a divine incarnation.
Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and involve the people for this project with the cooperation of five State governments.
They came to Allahabad and took an oath before Mother Ganga that they will make all out efforts to immediately stop the practice of open defecation in their villages situated on the banks of Ganga, start a campaign of building toilets and also that these villages will make their full contribution in cleaning up Ganga and will ensure that Ganga is not polluted now.
I also congratulate all those Ministries of the Government of India and also those ministers who turned this vision into reality.
I also want to thank the Chief Ministers of these five States for taking the vital step in the direction of making Ganga clean by involving peoples power.
Students of age between seven to seventeen took up this task.
And this had such an impact, such an emotional impact that while the students were going to school the next day, their parents handed over reply letters to them addressed to the teacher in which they promised to build toilets by a certain date positively.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a sixteen year old girl Mallamma started a Satyagrah against her own family.
Now, look at the gesture of village Pradhan Mohammad Shafi, he arranged eighteen thousand rupees and got a toilet built within a week.
Just see the power and strength in Mallammas protest, and also consider the grand gesture of a village Pradhan like Mohammad Shafi.
Look how the solutions to problems are found, this is the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, Swachha Bharat has become the dream of each Indian.
Some Indians have made it their resolve.
Some Indians have made it their aim and purpose.
Acting on one such idea, the Government of India has called upon the people to make short films of 2 to 3 minutes duration on Swachhta, that is, cleanliness and send these to the Government.
You can find details of this plan on website.
A competition will be held and the winners will be awarded prizes on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I request TV channels also to invite such films and hold a competition.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried its best to have close, cordial and vibrant relations with its neighbours.
A very important event took place recently. The Honourable President of India Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new radio channel named Akashvani Maitree Channel at Kolkata.
Now, some people may wonder whether Honourable President should inaugurate a Radio Channel
But this is no ordinary Radio Channel, it is a very big and very important step.
We have Bangladesh as our neighbour.
We know that both Bangladesh and West Bengal continue to have a common cultural heritage.
So, Akashvani Maitree on this side and Bangladesh Betaar on that side will mutually share the content and Bengali speaking people on both sides will enjoy the programmes of Akashvani, that is, All India Radio.
This people to people contact is a big contribution of Akashvani.
The President launched this radio channel.
I extend my thanks to Bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative.
I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also.
Such sentimental incidents generate new energy, give new inspiration and this is what motivates us Indians to do some remarkable things.
I received a letter recently which touched my heart.
A motherly lady of about 84 years of age who is a retired teacher wrote that letter to me.
If she had not forbidden me from revealing her name, I from the core of my heart wanted to announce her name while talking to you.
She wrote in her letter that after my appeal to the people to forego their cooking gas subsidy, she had given up her subsidy and then she even forgot about it.
Dear countrymen, you may be knowing that I have tried to send a letter, to be delivered personally through my representatives, to all those who surrendered their cooking gas subsidy on my appeal.
My effort is to send letters to more than one crore people.
It is not a question of 50 thousand rupees but the basic question is of the empathy in this old lady and it is because of the blessings of this lady and of crores of our other mothers and sisters which strengthens my confidence in the future of the country.
My dear countrymen, we were struggling with drought-like conditions last year but this August we have been facing the fury of floods all through.
In some parts of the country, there have been repetitive floods.
State governments, Union government, local self-government bodies, social organisations and the citizens did whatever best could be done.
Yet, even amidst the reports of these floods, some such events happened which should be remembered.
Those trying to disturb peace in Kashmir by putting small children in the front and hiding behind them will have to be answerable to these very innocent children some day.
My dear countrymen, ours is a vast nation, full of diversities.
That is all for today, many many thanks.
Early this morning, I had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi.
And I believe, in the days to come, the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country.
All of us know that in a few days time, the worlds largest sports event, the biggest sports carnival will take place.
RIO is going to resound in our ears time and again.
In Delhi this morning, the Government of India had organised a very good event, Run for RIO, Play and Live, Play and Blossom.
In the days to come, wherever we are, let us do our bit to encourage our sportspersons.
Just like 1. 25 billion Indians I too as a citizen would like to join you in encouraging them, cheering them up.
Come, over the next few days, let us try to the fullest extent possible to make each one of our sportspersons feel proud, to reward them for their endeavours and exertions
and today, as I speak on the Rio Olympics, I would like to mention the name of a poetry lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay a student of the Punjab Central University, who has sent me a poem.
Its possible that many poets would have written poems, some may be planning to write, some may even compose their verses into songs, in all languages. But here I would like to share with you the poem sent by Suraj Ji.
Ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalamji, which was observed last week.
The country, in fact the world paid glowing tributes to him.
The mere mention of Abdul Kalamjis name brings to mind vivid images of science, technology, missiles in fact the entire spectrum of strengths and capabilities of India in the days to come.
And thats why Ankit asks me... What is your government doing to ensure that Abdul Kalamjis dreams come true
And if we go on just using old technology without recourse to research and innovation, we will become outdated in this rapidly changing world and age.
And that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research innovation in the field of technology.
And that is why I say let us aim to innovate.
And when I say let us aim to innovate my AIM stands for Atal Innovation Mission.
If we have to develop the next generation innovators, we shall have to link our children with it.
And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have strong and well-equipped Incubation Centres, a system comes into place for innovations, for start-ups, for experimentation and to bring these efforts to a certain level.
Creation of new Incubation Centres is essential just as it is necessary to strengthen the older Incubation Centres.
We shall now have to look for technological solutions for these.
Through the Atal Grand Challenges we have exhorted the young generation of the country that if they see problems, they should search for solutions taking the path of technology, doing research, applying innovations and bring those on board.
The Government of India wants to specially reward technology developed to find solutions to our problems.
And I am happy that people have evinced interest in these things.
When we spoke of Tinkering Labs, about 13 thousand schools applied and when we talked of Incubation Centres, over four thousand academic and non-academic institutions came forward.
Central government and State Governments are working hand in hand with their utmost efforts to provide relief and assistance to the flood-affected.
Despite causing some hardships, rains make every human heart rejoice since rains, and agriculture, are the focal point of our entire sphere of economic activities.
There are times when one has to face an illness that leaves a scar for a lifetime.
But if we are aware, alert and active, the prevention is also very easy.
Pay attention to cleanliness, be alert, try and be safe and take special care of children.
And the mindset that such diseases strike poor neighborhoods only, is not valid in the case of Dengue.
Dengue first enters affluent localities and we should try and understand it.
You must be watching advertisements on TV but there are times when we neglect taking proactive and informed action on it.
I would like to draw the attention of my dear countrymen to another menace.
In todays fast paced, rat race of life, at times we dont have time to think about ourselves.
When we fall sick, we want to get well as soon as possible and as a result pop in just any antibiotic that we can lay our hands on.
It may give you instant relief, but my dear countrymen, this random pill popping habit can land you in deep trouble.
It may give you temporary succor, but we should completely stop taking antibiotics without the advice of a doctor.
Microbes spreading TB and malaria are bringing about rapid mutations in themselves, rendering medicines ineffective.
In medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance.
Hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics.
You must pay attention to that.
While we are on the subject of health, I would like to talk about one more issue.
I feel very concerned about the lives of pregnant women of our country.
In our country, close to 3 crore women become pregnant every year but some of these mothers die during childbirth. Sometimes the mother loses her life, at times the infant does.
It is true that in the last decade there has been a decline in maternal mortality rates but even now, we are not able to save the lives of a large number of pregnant women.
Anemia during or after pregnancy, pregnancy related infections, high BP, any such complication can have devastating effect.
Keeping in view these issues, in the last few months, the Government of India has launched a new campaign Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign.
Under this, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will get a check-up at government health centers free of cost.
I have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month, for the sake of under privileged mothers
Cant my doctor brothers and sisters spare just 12 days in a year for this service to the under privileged
My dear countrymen, today, the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change, global warming and the environment.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra too, Bhagwan Shri Krishna talks of trees. Showing concern towards trees even in the midst of a battle, underlines how much importance was attached to trees.
In the Gita, Bhagwan Shri Krishna says, ashwatth sarvvrikshanam which means amongst all trees, I am the Peepal Tree.
It is proclaimed in Shukracharya Neeti that naastimulam anaushadham meaning that there is no plant that does not have medicinal values
He who donates a tree, that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children.
Therefore it is appropriate that parents desiring their well-being should plant tree and rear them like their own children.
Our scriptures like Gita, Shukracharya Niti and Anushasan Parv of the Mahabharta contain such lofty ideals. However, there are certain individuals in the present generation also, who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, I came across a mention of Sonal, a young daughter from Pune. It touched my heart.
It is mentioned in Anushasan Parv in Mahabharata that a tree is like an offspring and becomes means of salvation in after life, Sonal has not only taken it upon herself to fulfill her parents wishes but societys expectations also.
Shri Khandu Maruti Mhatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village of of Junner Taluka of Pune got his granddaughter Sonal married in a very inspiring manner.
Other temples too can start the practice of distributing saplings instead of prasad during this rainy season.
Today India has to spend billions and trillions of rupees to import timber wood from abroad for construction of houses and furniture.
If we plant on the boundaries of our fields timber trees that can be utilised for construction of homes and furniture and which can also be cut and sold after 15 to 20 years with the permission of the government.
This way, not only can these become a new source of your income, but can also save India from importing timber.
Some days ago, a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the Government of India has also passed CAMPA law, under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees.
Rajasthan, desert area, has celebrated Van Mahotsav in a very big way and pledged to plant 25 lakhs trees.
To plant 25 lakhs of sapling in Rajasthan is not a small matter
Those who know the soil conditions of Rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be.
Andhra Pradesh, too has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by the year 2029.
Under the central governments ongoing Green India Mission, Railways too have joined in this endeavour.
Gujarat too has an illustrious tradition of observing Van Mahotsav.
This year Gujarat has undertaken many projects like Aamra Van, Ekata Van and Shaheed Van as a part of Van Mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am not able to mention every state but all deserve to be appreciated.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa for the first time some time back.
During a foreign visit, diplomacy is practiced, there are trade deliberations, discussions about security and as is customary, many MoUs are concluded.
But for me the visit to South Africa was more like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words non-violence, love and forgiveness, the inspiring faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoenix settlement where Mahatma Gandhis home is known as Sarvodaya.
I also had the good fortune of traveling from Pietermaritzburg station in the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled, and which was the site of the incidence that sowed the seed of the transformation of a Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi. But what I want to tell you is the fact that this time I had an opportunity to meet those great men who had devoted their young lives for society fighting shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela for the ideals of equality and equal opportunity
There was not a single trace of desire, to get something, to become somebody even after living such a great life of Tapasaya.
The essence of performing ones duty as explained in Gita was embodied in their persona.
I will remember that meeting forever.
Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest mantras for any society and government.
Equality and equal opportunity, compassion and fraternity, these are the paths leading us to a bright future.
We all want a good future for our children.
Everybody has different needs and different priorities but there is one common path of development, equality, compassion and fraternity.
Come, let us be proud about these Indians who have lived their lives in South Africa embodying our highest and fundamental ideals.
My dear countrymen, I have received a message from Shilpi Varma, to whom I am grateful.
She has made me aware of an incident: Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shilpi Varma speaking from Bengaluru.
Some days ago, I read in a news article that a lady became a victim of fraud and cheat email, lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
Being a woman, I feel an empathy with her family.
What is your opinion about such cheat and fraud emails.
People get duped by this money trap.
These are new methods of technology that are spreading in the entire world for cheating people.
And just as technology plays an increasingly bigger role in our economic system, it also invites those who misuse it.
These people write a letter in such style that it seems perfect.
They use fake letter pads while sending these letters. They obtain your credit card number and debit card number and empty your bank account through technology.
And this new means of fraud is digital fraud.
I believe that we must be aware against such lure, must remain cautious and if such false communications come to our notice, then we must share them with our friends and make them aware also.
Our MPs also bring people from their constituencies and introduce them to me they tell me many things, their difficulties also.
But recently I had a pleasant experience, real pleasant experience
Student from Aligarh had come to meet me.
These were artistic painting done on the station.
What is more, they had searched for and collected the plastic bottles and oil cans lying in the garbage in the villages and by filling those with soil and planting saplings, they have transformed those pots into a vertical garden.
And by creating this vertical garden on the site of railway station, they have given it a new look.
If you go to Aligarh, do visit the railway station.
They have brought about a refreshing feeling.
This is a prime example of the great transformation, which can be brought about through peoples participation.
I felicitate all such citizens involved in these kinds of activities and especially congratulate friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country.
There would be fairs everywhere, festivities would be observed in temples and places of worship.
You too will become a participant at home and outside during the festive celebrations.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a festival of special significance.
Just like last year, cant you gift on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna to mothers and sisters of our country.
My dear countrymen there are many among us who were born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of this nation who was born in free India.
uit India movement started on 8th august, and this year would be the 75th year of uit Hind -uit Bharat and on 15th august, it would be 70th year of our independence.
We are enjoying our independence and are proud to be free citizens, but this is an occasion to remember those who sacrificed their all for winning our independence.
The 75th year of uit India and 70th year of Independence can be source of new inspiration, source of new enthusiasm and an occasion to take a pledge to do something for our nation.
I hope that you too become inspired with the spirit of patriotism and do something good in that vein.
IN. Today the platforms of technology are such that your message can reach me very easily.
Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays.
Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit.
Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice.
But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.
It is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat.
On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected.
Hence, in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water.
I was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue.
They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana.
It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so.
What a big collective decision this must have been
If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be.
I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages.
I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.
I was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds.
They have already created 27 farm ponds.
Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level.
Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise.
It is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over.
Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106 and 110 it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come.
There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy.
Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops.
This time why cant we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields
If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase.
Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches
There would be sufficient water in our water-wells.
Thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible.
The water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively.
Therefore, notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation, we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater.
Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive.
Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results.
For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts.
We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives.
The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country.
Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths.
The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people.
So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness.
There are many efforts being made by the government.
We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows.
We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort.
We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution.
Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains.
At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it.
All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river.
I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day.
So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river.
In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.
To monitor and control industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industries, and it has also been implemented to some extent.
The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end.
All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga. People are even giving donations for this.
My dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April.
This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country.
Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.
We celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day.
From the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, to 24th April, the day Panchayati Raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages, which are the strongest link of our Constitution.
It inspired linking these two dates.
For this reason, the Government of India, along with the cooperation of the State Governments, has launched a campaign From Gram Uday to Bharat Uday From the Rise of Villages to the Ascent of India, over the 10-day period between 14th April and 24th April.
It was my good fortune that on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, I got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place.
And today, on 24th April, I am going to Jharkhand, where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay. In Jharkhand I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Divas.
At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country.
This campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness.
It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads.
They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy.
so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.
Sharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call.
Prime Minister Namaskar.
I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai.
I have a question for you about the school and college education.
For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector.
Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education.
A house, a car all that comes later.
And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force.
To educate their children and educate them well, this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about.
So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything thats happenings in their school.
And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself.
Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system.
Peoples participation will go a long way in achieving this.
Every Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way.
It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children.
We have already done a lot towards expanding education.
Now we will have to focus on quality education.
We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education.
Till now we concentrated on the outlay for education.
The time has come to focus on the outcome of it.
Till now the stress has been on how many are attending school.
Enrolment Enrolment
But now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education, worthy education to children who have made it to schools.
You must have seen the Budget of the present government.
An effort is being made to provide quality education.
But it is true we still have a long way to go.
If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance.
Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.
You must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional.
In the Budget, we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own.
Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should.
Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill.
Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education.
Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler.
I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.
Its mostly the youth who write to me.
Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore.
For the youth in todays age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance.
They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development.
I want you to motivate the youth as much as you can, and I want the government to also promote NCC, NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides as much as possible.
You people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people.
It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra.
I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this.
This time I put some issues before them.
I told them that for this season why dont all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation.
We spoke on many issues.
I view it also as something that is going to shake us all.
You must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders.
On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders.
For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy.
This has been everybodys experience.
I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all.
One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders.
These one crore are not wealthy families.
Among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers. These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy.
But it has been estimated that more than 80 of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.
My dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter.
If the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax, then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on TV channels and in newspapers.
And in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect.
I would like to salute those one crore families.
I humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new. This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently.
Even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom.
Sometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker.
We can undertake several such experiments.
Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results.
Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts.
We cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere.
This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.
Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every breaking news.
Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
He used to continuously repeat that.
Some days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news.
And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news.
It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that.
Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.
It is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things.
If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled.
You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india.
This is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing thats happened to you.
You can contribute to the site.
Raviji you have given a good suggestion, but please dont get angry with me.
We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.
There is one great speciality of our country the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well.
Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival.
The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul.
These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and peoples participation, set new and high standards.
I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion.
People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them.
It is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place. People should carry back the message of cleanliness with them.
I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion.
We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values.
It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages.
My dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
As usual, you and I eagerly keep waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
This time too, numerous letters, comments phone calls have poured in full of stories, suggestions inspiration everybody wants to do something or the other
It seems I am being put to test.
Yet, once again I want to offer you your own precious thoughts, woven together on the singular thread of Mann Ki Baat.
It must be part of your recent memory that in the earlier episode, I had referred to a collection of short stories by Premchand ji, We had decided that on reading any book, some of its facets should be shared with all through the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen that people in large numbers have shared a lot of information on a variety of books.
It is heartwarming to see them discuss books published on subjects such as Science, Technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life-sketches and so on.
Some have advised me to dwell upon many other books.
But I must candidly admit here that I am not able to devote much time to reading books these days.
But the experience over the last one month makes me feel that we need to take it forward.
I want this book corner to be an active forum for readers writers alike.
Friends, I touched upon the subject of water conservation in Mann Ki Baat and today I feel that it was an issue close to your heart even before I referred to it, a matter of universal human interest.
I have experienced the fact that this topic has stirred the nations heart strings collectively.
Many an informed, effective endeavour is afoot across the country.
People have shared information on traditional methods.
The media has embarked upon quite a few innovative campaigns.
This has led to not only stopping soil erosion prevention of crop damage, but also facilitated effective irrigation of fields.
And you will be happy to know that the beautiful North Eastern State of Meghalaya has become the first state to have formulated its own water-policy.
I congratulate the Government of Meghalaya.
Many fairs are held on these occasions.
Why dont we use these fairs to spread the message of water conservation
All sections of society turn up in fairs in large numbers.
Here, we can effectively spread awareness on the need to save water through forums such as exhibitions and street plays, thus using the festive fervour to convey the message of water conservation with ease.
And that is why today, I feel like mentioning about a few children.
They are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguli Hrithik Alaamandaa.
What I tell you about them will fill your hearts with pride verve as well.
All of us know that just the word CANCER is more than enough to scare the world.
It conjures images of Death waiting at the doorstep.
But each of these Ten children, not only fought against the dreaded disease cancer in their battle of life, but also brought glory laurels to the country.
In sports and games, we often get to see a player becoming a champion after winning a tournament or bagging a medal this was a rare occasion when the participants were champions BEFORE they entered the contest...
Actually, this month, the World Childrens Winners Games were held in Moscow.
In this tournament, sports games such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football table-tennis are organized.
All Ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Out of these, some players even won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I firmly believe that you must have felt immensely proud on Indias achievement beyond the skies...
People from across the country, such as Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Arvind Rao from Telangana, and many others have written to me on Narendra Modi App and mygov, urging me to speak on Chandrayaan II in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, in the realms of Space, 2019 has been a very fruitful year for India.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March.
After that, amidst the hectic engagements during Elections, an important development such as the A-Sat could not be a prominent part of the discourse.
Whereas the fact is, through the A-Sat, we have acquired the capability of destroying a satellite three hundred Kilometres away in a mere three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world, possessing this capacity.
And now, on the 22nd of July, the nation watched with pride Chandrayaan II taking strides into space from Sriharikota.
Visuals of Chandrayaan II lifting off filled our countrymens hearts with glory, zest and joy.
Chandrayaan II is a mission that is special on many counts.
We should trust our talents capacities
You will be glad to know that Chandrayaan II is INDIAN to the core.
It is thoroughly Indian in heart spirit.
It is completely a swadeshi, home grown mission.
The way our scientists rectified Technical issues in record time, burning the midnight oil, is in itself an exemplary, unparalleled task.
many are amazed at that. We have to face temporary setbacks in life...
but always remember- the capacity to overcome them resides within us.
I fervently hope that the Chandrayaan II mission will inspire our youth towards Science Innovation.
After all, Science is the path to progress.
We are now expectantly waiting for the month of September, when Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan will land on Lunar surface.
Through Mann Ki Baat today, I wish to share with students, my young friends, information on a very interesting competition ... I invite young boys girls to a uiz Competition.
Your inquisitiveness regarding Space, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the salient features of this uiz Competition. For example, How is a rocket launched, how is a satellite placed in orbit, what information do we gather from a satellite, what is A-Sat...
I urge my young friends, students to participate in this competition and make it interesting and memorable through their participation.
For these winners, it will be a historic event of their life. But for that, you will have to participate in the uiz competition, score the highest be a winner.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing. Our chain of Mann Ki Baat has lent pace to the cleanliness campaign from time to time.
Similarly, efforts towards ensuring cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
A journey that began five years ago gathered momentum with mass participation is now setting up newer benchmarks in cleanliness sanitation.
It is not that we have reached the ideal yet, but the way we have achieved success in ODF clean public spaces, it displays the collective will strength of the resolve of a hundred thirty crore countrymen.
But we are not stopping at that.
This movement has now advanced from cleanliness towards beautification.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
Recently, he has picked up the gauntlet to not just clean up Delhi, but to beautify it.
With his team, he began with the garbage bins of Lodi Garden.
Through the medium of street art, he has decorated many localities of Delhi with aesthetically appealing paintings.
From over bridges to school walls to hutments he gave a free hand to his talent, garnering huge public support on the way, on the lines of an effective campaign.
Remember how, during the Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings
I came to know that Yogesh Saini his team played a stellar role in it.
Colours lines may be mute, but when they merge to form a picture, the rainbow that emanates speaks louder than a thousand words.
We experience this in the beauty, the aesthetics of the Swachchata Abhiyan.
It is imperative that the culture of transforming waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move ahead on the path of converting garbage to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting comment on My gov.
This comment came from Brother Muhammad Aslam who stays in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to the programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to let you know that I played a positive active role in organizing the community mobilisation programme- Back to Village in my state Jammu Kashmir.
This programme was organized in the month of June.
I feel such programmes should be organized every quarter.
Simultaneously, there should be a provision for online monitoring too.
According to me, this was a one of a kind programme where the public directly entered into a dialogue with the Government.
Brother Mohd Aslam ji had sent me a message upon reading which I felt curious to know more about the Back to village programme and when I got to knew it at length, I felt that the entire nation should get to know about this programme.
The people of Kashmir are eager to join the national main stream, their enthusiasm is reflected in the mechanism of this programme.
officials briefing the villagers about the schemes and programmes implemented by the Government and also inquired whether these facilities were available to them or not.
How to increase their income
To make this programme even more interesting many other means were employed.
Many sports competitions for kids were organized under the aegis of Khelo India.
Sports Kits, MNREGA job cards and SCST certificates were distributed.
There were Financial Literacy camps and Agriculture and Horticulture Department set up stalls where knowledge about govt.
schemes was disseminated.
In this manner, this programme became a festival celebrating development, a festival of peoples participation and a festival of peoples awakening .
The people of Kashmir open heartedly became equal stakeholders in this festival.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by the reception they received, that they decided to extend their stay upto two days in these villages.
The organizing of Gram Sabhas in these villages, wherein the people participated in large numbers and chalked out schemes for themselves is something that is an extremely pleasant experience.
A new resolve, a new fervor and grand results.
Programmes like these and peoples participation or stake holding indicates that our brothers and sisters in Kashmir want good Governance and proves the dictum that the power of development is stronger than the might of bullets and bombs.
It is clear that those who wish to spread hatred en route to development, pose hurdles will never succeed in their sinister plans.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatraya Ramchandra Bendre, gyanpith laureate and poet has described the significance of the month of Sawan in this manner- in his poem. Meaning that the relationship between drizzling rain and stream of water is wondrous and earth gets bedazzled by such spectacle
Whenever we look around us in this season it appears as if earth has draped itself in a sheet of greenery
It is during this season that the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizing the bond between a brother and sister also falls.
While we are talking of the month of sawan, you will be glad to learn that the number of pilgrims in the Amarnath Yatra this year has been the greatest in the past 4 years.
A total of 3 lakh pilgrims have had the darshan of the holy Amarnath shrine from 1st July till now.
In 2015, the number of devotees who performed this pilgrimage over 60 days has been crossed over by the number of pilgrims in mere 28 days this year
I would especially like to thank the hospitality of the people of Jammu- Kashmir while referring to successful organization of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return after performing this pilgrimage become imbued with the feelings of warmth and kinship displayed by the people of the state.
These are portents of booming tourism in the future.
I have been told that within a span of a month- and- a half of the commencement of Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have had the darshan of Kedarnath Shrine.
This is a record number of pilgrims post the apocalyptic events of 2013.
I appeal to all of you to visit those tourist spots within our country whose scenic beauty is to behold during the monsoon.
There are no better ways to witness this nations beauty and peoples sentiments and no better teachers than tourism and pilgrimage.
I extend my felicitation to you all, that may this beauteous and lively month of Sawan fill all of us with new energy, new hopes and new expectations.
On the other hand, heavy rainfall in many parts of the country has resulted in countrymen suffering due to floods.
On television, we witness just one aspect of monsoon- floods everywhere, water logging and traffic jam
The other picture of monsoon- the overjoyed farmer, chirping birds, gurgling waterfalls and earth wrapped under a green cover, to witness this you will have to step out along with your family.
Rains bring freshness and happiness with them, my heartiest wish is that the monsoon keep on bringing happiness to you and you all enjoy best of health.
My dear countrymen, where to begin Mann Ki Baat and where to end it, is a difficult task But there is a time limit
Ill be back after a months wait and meet you again.
I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.
Some of my young friends must be busy with their examinations.
Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now.
For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other.
I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.
Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.
Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs.
Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.
We should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India.
Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football.
There are very few people who go abroad most people visit places within their own states for a week or so.
Some people also go outside their states.
Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit.
We have to take this task forward.
But this time, along with a photo, please write and send a small piece about the place, thus displaying your creative prowess.
Someone has rightly said that A traveller without observation is a bird without wings.
If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.
I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel.
When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot.
Perhaps there isnt a district in India which I have not visited.
Travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives.
These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity.
Our youth should be bold.
They should be brave. They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.
In this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India.
Generally we dont think of coal mines as places to be visited.
When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there.
We even have a saying, Coal blackens your hands, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines.
But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism.
This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur.
This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.
I hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too.
Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done.
Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations
I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.
There are many employment opportunities created by tourism.
India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world.
But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world.
We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side.
Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens we all have to come together to make this happen.
Come, lets make an endeavour in this direction.
My dear young friends, I dont like it when holidays are just frittered away.
You too should think along these lines.
Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that
I will give you something to ponder upon.
Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays
If you dont know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays
If you dont know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays
You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill.
it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you.
This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously.
This will perhaps become a big thing among friends.
This time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.
in: Sound Byte- My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds.
I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear fellow citizens, I would like to express my gratitude to this little boy Abhi.
He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me.
Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends.
The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds.
She wrote this in one of her poems, We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water...
Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do.
I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.
Shilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue.
She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes.
Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes.
Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days Have we ever given them water to drink
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term Digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips.
There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides.
If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it they will explain things to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance.
Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected
You must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs.
Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation.
How can we save every drop of water during the coming rains How do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village
You should devise a plan and get connected with Government schemes so that we can start a peoples movement which will help us understand the importance of water. Then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation.
There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work.
But we still need to do much more in this direction.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, Farmers Fair.
There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture.
But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields.
Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed.
I welcome this.
Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell.
But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food
No matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination.
There should be a balance in everything.
This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money.
I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation.
Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.
My dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April.
This year the theme of the World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases.
Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it.
It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics.
Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths.
Diabetes is of two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary if the parents have it, so shall their child.
Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity.
The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes.
Physical labour is getting reduced.
There is not a trace of sweat
there is just no walking around.
Even if we play games, we play them online
very little happens offline.
If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga.
Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run.
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy.
Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily.
Please do be concerned about this.
On March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day.
When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB.
Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it
but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it.
Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients.
If we want to free ourselves and our country from TB, then we need correct treatment, we need complete treatment.
If we leave the treatment mid-way, it can create new complications for us.
Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot.
This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.
My dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction.
There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories.
All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely.
I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these.
We have to eradicate these diseases from India.
But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you dont do something about it.
So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.
My dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
The five pilgrimage spots associated with him Mhow, his birthplace
London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his Deeksha
I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens.
We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.
It is celebrated in different states in different forms.
Some call it Nav Samvatsar, some call it Gudi Padva, some Varsh Pratipada, some Ugadi, but it holds importance in nearly all the states of India.
As you know and I had said it last time also, you can now listen to my Mann Ki Baat in about 20 languages whenever you wish to.
All you have to do is to give a missed call.
I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it.
You too can note down the number. 81908-81908.
I repeat 81908-81908.
I will be happy to remain connected with you.
I wish to be a part of this journey along with you.
I am concerned about your childrens exams as much as you are, but I am not worried.
If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.
When I shared my inner thoughts with you during last months Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App.
Today, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers.
I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told.
I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now.
How many marks are you likely to score
I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself.
Dont come under the pressure of someone elses expectations.
You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target.
When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well.
As time passed, their expectations kept growing.
So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this.
Thats when I decided that I would set expectations for myself and set my own targets.
If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country.
And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself.
My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own.
So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results.
Good luck
Dont buckle under the pressure of expectations.
It is you who have to shape your own future.
So set your own targets for yourselves.
Why do we waste our time competing with others
Why dont we decide to break our own previous record
Friends, dont look at exams as a game of numbers.
You should think of a greater purpose in life. You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to.
Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not.
Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed.
Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.
Thousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app.
Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only.
Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit.
In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.
I agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise ones preparation.
One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time.
This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping.
When I talk of sleep, please dont think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams.
At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension.
I hope you will not do that.
I am sure you wont do anything like that.
Discipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives.
A strong foundation comes from discipline.
Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night.
So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant.
Do things the way you have planned them.
Friends, I have seen that there are two types of students.
There are students who focus their attention on what they have studied, what they have learnt, and what are their strong points.
The other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams, whether they will be able to attempt answering them, will the question paper be easy or difficult.
You must have noticed this too.
It is very, very similar to a game of Chess.
When you play, you dont know, which pawn will appear, just like in a class you dont know, which question will appear in an exam.
So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment.
Just see it as a challenge do I remember what I was taught during the year, can I solve these problems.
So stay calm, get a good nights sleep, dont be over-confident but dont be pessimistic either.
I have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before.
So stay confident and all the very best to you.
Vishwanathan Anand has really said something very important.
You must have seen his eyes dont wander off the chess board.
We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird.
In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity.
If you dont speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind.
Laugh a lot along with your friends, share jokes with them, and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own.
But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.
Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better. So here is a technique I have developed for myself.
I do deep-breathing.
I breathe deeply three to five times.
Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand.
This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.
This is something very important Rajat-ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam, we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong.
And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper.
We just get caught in all that.
Friends, please dont do this.
What happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself.
Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter.
If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw.
Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents.
From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world.
Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students.
And whatever situation appears, accept it.
My experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances.
If you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily, you are sure to gain success.
And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse.
I am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.
Friends I want to tell you about another thing today.
Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, ShriSushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair.
But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time.
If you do Yoga, keep doing it.
Yes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes.
But why should you do these things in a hurry.
Why cant you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam.
Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress.
One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time.
I have seen that when we get the question paper, sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern. But if we have read the instructions with due attention, we can cope well with it.
It is very important to understand the questions.
He has emphasized the virtue of patience. He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students.
Thats what I tell all my young friends.
At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country.
All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity.
With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses.
I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country. The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence...
just keep at it my friends.
If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid.
And a golden future awaits you for doing well.
Ruchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience.
We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison.
But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives. This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.
Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics
The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide.
But it was not like that from the start.
She had to face many difficulties, many problems.
Exams are not just for the students, they also put the students families, schools and teachers to test.
Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance.
If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.
Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks.
They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams.
They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.
Vijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations.
They should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible.
Please dont create any pressure for your children.
If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please dont stop them.
Friends, one thing is for sure, and I want to say this especially to my young friends, that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations.
We also want to move ahead with the speed of science.
I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country.
Every year this day is observed on 28th February.
On 28th February 1928, Sir C.
Raman had declared his discovery of the Raman Effect.
This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize.
And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Each person should have a scientific thinking, should be attracted to science. Each generation should lay stress on innovation.
I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.
Raman and I appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science.
Friends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely.
As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds. But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well.
Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists.
I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward
India will be a part of future international efforts.
My dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision.
This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world.
India is going to be the third.
I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.
My dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat.
You can even listen to it in your mother tongue.
The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908. I repeat 81908-81908.
Friends, your exams begin from day after tomorrow.
I have to take an exam tomorrow.
125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam.
29th February. It is a leap year.
But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am.
My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter.
Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.
Thank You.
This will be the last edition of Mann ki Baat in 2015.
The next edition of Mann ki Baat will be in 2016.
We celebrated Christmas and preparations are now on to ring in the New Year.
India is land of diversities.
We celebrate a whole lot of festivals.
At times it feels India is one such country which has a festival driven economy.
It becomes a source of the economic activities for even the poor sections of the society.
Greetings from my end for a Merry Christmas to all Indians and I also wish you all a Happy New Year.
May 2016 usher in lots of joys in your lives.
I hope that new zeal, new excitement and new pledges may take you to new heights.
May the world be free of crises, be it from terrorism, from global warming or from natural calamities or manmade tragedies.
You are aware that I use a lot of technology which provides me lots of information.
People also travel to celebrate Christmas vacations.
He says most of the facilities related to tourism are catered to but special emphasis should be laid on cleanliness at all places which are tourist destinations or famed tourist places, religious destinations or stay overs.
Indias image will be enhanced if the tourist destinations are clean.
I appreciate the views of Ganesh jee and convey this message to the people of our country.
He did something so different that the newspapers printed his story.
And when it came to my notice, I wanted to share this story with you.
Hailing from a small village, Dileep Singh Malviya decided that if anyone provides materials for toilet in the village, he will render his labour services free of cost.
And hats off to him, he has constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far taking it as a divine cause and providing his labour services without charging a penny.
My heartfelt congratulations to Dileep Singh Malviya for his earnest efforts.
Sometimes we hear disappointing news about our nation.
Due to tireless efforts of many people the nation is making rapid progress.
125 crores Indians are not only marching together but they are taking the country forward too.
Better education, best talent and new opportunities of employment are being created. Be it providing insurance cover to citizens or providing them banking facilities, be it the Ease of Doing Business in the world horizon or making facilities available for new businesses, we have done it all.
People from normal backgrounds who could not step inside banks can now avail loan facilities from the Mudra Yojana.
Every Indian is proud to know how the world is accepting and getting attracted towards Yoga. When the world celebrated International Yoga Diwas and the entire world got associated with it, we became proud of our country.
Such emotions arise when we see the enormity of our nation.
The concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
But I am sure that media will definitely reach such villages and will inform the nation about the happiness and excitement of the people there.
The biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself.
Be it the farmers, poor, young or women, should such things reach them or not
Such news should reach them not to highlight any governments achievement, but to make them aware of their rights. They should not let go if it is their right.
People should get information in order to avail their rights.
We should all make efforts that right information, good information and information useful to the common man should reach as many people as possible.
This is also a kind of service.
I too have tried to do this work from my end.
I cannot do everything alone by myself. But if I am saying then I should at least do something.
Even a common man can download the Narendra Modi App and get connected to me.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people share all the things with me.
You too get connected with this initiative, we have to reach 125 crore Indians. How will I reach without your help
Come, let us collectively do such things of interest for the common man in their language and inspire them to avail things which are their rights.
My dear young friends, I had some preliminary discussions about Start-up India, Stand-up India in my speech on 15th August from the Red Fort.
After that all government departments started discussing it. Can India become a Start-up Capital
Everything should be new, new ways and new thinking - after all the world does not move ahead without innovation.
The Indian youth all over the country has talent, all they need is opportunities.
And I will request the state governments to take this forward.
I will definitely interact with you on 16th January and will discuss this in detail.
There are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him.
Since 1995, 12th January, the birth Anniversary of Vivekananda is celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year it will be organized from 12-16th January in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival
I would request the youth to send me their suggestions directly on the Narendra Modi App.
I want to gain an insight into your understanding.
And that it gets reflected in the Youth Festival, for that I will give the government reasonable suggestions and information.
So I will wait dear friends for your suggestions on the youth festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, who is a visually challenged teacher celebrated Accessible India Day in his school.
And the students response was fantastic, we enjoyed in the school and the students were inspired and motivated to help the disabled people in the society.
I think it was a great initiative by you.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You are yourself working in this field.
You understand everything and you must have faced a lot of difficulties too.
Sometimes when we meet someone with different ability in the society then a lot of things come to our mind.
We express our perception of him based on our thinking.
There are some people who lose a limb or body part in an accident.
Some people are born with some defects.
And for these people different terms are used and a lot of thought goes on behind the usage of these terms.
All the time people feel that this kind of identification does not sound nice and respectable.
It is true that words have their own significance.
This year when the government of India started the Sugamya India programme.
However, since I had to attend that program some thoughts kept coming iin my mind.
That time, I thought that we call or know those people as handicapped since they are lacking in some ways in terms of their body structure or whose organs do not function properly.
However, at times when we interact with them, we realize that we see only the deficits with our eyes but God has certainly bestowed them with some extra powers.
They are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity, where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have.
I like this term.
My dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word Divyang and make it popular.
That day we started the Sugamya Bharat campaign.
Under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the Divyang people.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, everywhere ramps, accessible parking, accessible lifts, Braille, many amenities will be made available.
In our country, we give subsidy for the gas cylinders.
The Government has made some changes in the scheme.
The government undertook the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of Jan Dhan Account or Aadhar Card etc.
I am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme which has been implemented successfully.
This scheme is known as Pehel and this experiment has been very successful.
Till November end, around 15 crore LPG customers have become its beneficiaries.
Nowadays, even the MNREGA scheme, which provides employment opportunities in villages, is being connected to it.
There were lots of complaints about this scheme.
In many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts.
There were complaints about student scholarships too, they too are being transferred into their accounts.
This has been started and will be gradually taken forward.
Till now around 40,000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes.
According to my rough estimate, around 35-40 schemes are now under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is the golden moment in the life of Indian democracy.
This is a beautiful co-incidence that Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the maker of the Indian Constitution, his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year.
We organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience.
But constitution equally emphasizes on duty also.
There is a lot of talk about duties during elections, but why not discuss our duties in general life too.
This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then can we make 26th January a medium to organize debates, poetry, slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools, colleges, villages, cities and various organizations and societies.
I have An iidea Send me an essay or poem before 26th January about duty in Hindi or English or your native language.
I want to know your views.
Send them on my portal My Gov.
I would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties.
I want to give a small suggestion.
On 26th January we celebrate Republic Day. Can we citizens and school and college students take up the initiative of cleaning the statue of any great men installed in our city, of cleaning the premises, we can do best of cleanliness and best of decoration on the occasion of 26th January.
And I am not saying this on government lines.
We become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them.
As a society, as a nation can we make it a natural tendency to respect the statues of our great men
On this 26th January let us make an effort that we will respect such great men and keep the premises clean.
But this should be done by the citizens willfully.
Dear Countrymen, greetings to you for a Happy New Year 2016.
Thank You Very Much
My dear countrymen, Namaste
The new trades and jobs would have commenced with renewed vigour.
On the other hand Christmas preparations must have started too.
Festivals have their own significance in social life.
Sometimes festivities help to heal wounds and sometimes they are source of renewed energy.
But sometimes when a calamity strikes during festivities then it is very painful and it feels even more.
There is continuous news of natural calamities from various parts of the world.
And sometimes the news is very bizarre, never seen or never heard of.
My heart goes out to all those people in this hour of crisis.
The state governments have braced themselves up for rescue and relief work.
The Central government too has joined them in their efforts.
Right now, a team of the Central government officials are in Tamil Nadu.
But I have full faith in Tamil Nadus potential and know that post this crisis it will rise again and speedily move forward and will continue to deliver in its role of taking the country forward.
Now when there are talks of such crisis all around, we feel the need to bring in a lot of change.
But today, its form and format has changed.
It has become important to work on our capacity building at every level.
The government, civil society, the citizens, and the small organizations will all have to work for capacity building through scientific temperament.
I am happy that a seminar workshop on table talk exercises and best practices was organized in Delhi. This is a good beginning.
And not just that, you also understand the problems of the farmers really well.
It is a practice in the entire country and traditionally we follow this method of burning off the remains of the crops or the straw.
Initially we were not aware of the damage. We did it because the others did it.
Secondly, people are not aware of the available solutions.
And now we are hearing more about it because it is affecting the city life too.
But the concern you have expressed is genuine.
So the first solution is that the brothers and sisters engaged in agriculture need to be trained.
They will need to face the truth on their thinking that burning the remains of crops helps save time and effort and prepares the field for the next crop.
The remains of the crop are themselves very valuable.
They are organic fertilizer themselves.
We are wasting them.
Not only this, if they are chopped into small bits, they can act as a dry fruit for cattle.
Secondly because of burning this the top soil gets burnt.
The top soil of our land is burnt which pushes our fertile soil to death.
Hence, some positive efforts need to be made.
If these remains are once again buried inside the soil, then it will turn into fertilizers.
If this is added to the soil, it will be doubly beneficial.
Once I had the opportunity of talking to farmers involved in Banana cultivation.
And they shared a very good experience.
To clear the stumps from the fields they had to spend 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 rupees per hectare.
And till the time the people who would clear these stumps would not come with tractors, the stumps would remain standing for long.
But some farmers chopped those stumps into 6-6, 8-8 inch pieces and buried them inside the soil.
They experienced that the banana stumps held so much water in them that no external water supply was needed for three months. Any plant or any crop sown over those stumps could flourish without water.
The water in the stumps kept the crops alive.
Earlier they had to spend money on clearing those stumps, now those very stumps are a source of revenue.
A small experiment can turn lucrative, our farmers are no less than scientists.
Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember 3rd December as International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Last time in Mann ki Baat I talked about organ donation.
I talked about the NOTO helpline for Organ donation.
27th November was celebrated as Indian Organ Donation Day.
Many famous personalities including actress Raveena Tandon became a part of it.
Organ Donation can save many valuable lives.
Organ donation can bring about immortality.
When an organ moves from one body to another it gets a new life but the person receiving it gets a new lease of life.
There can be no greater donation than this.
in organized a logo, donor card and slogan design competition for NOTO and it was surprising to me that so many people participated and presented their ideas in such innovative ways with such compassion.
People with physical and mental disabilities are capable of unparalleled courage and capability.
But if we change our outlook and our perspective towards them, then these people can inspire us to live.
We start crying even when small misfortune befalls us.
And hence all of them are a source of inspiration to us.
Their will power, their struggle with life and their zeal to transform crisis into opportunity is worth lot of praise.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
But the bullet damaged his kidney and a part of the intestine was lost.
He suffered serious spinal injury.
He lost the ability to stand on his own feet, but Jawed Ahmed did not concede defeat.
The grave injury caused by terrorism could not deter him.
His zeal is commendable, but above all is the fact that an innocent man had to face such a predicament, his youth is in danger yet he harbors no grudge and no anger.
He turned this crisis into compassion and dedicated his life to social work.
The body does not support him but for the past 20 years he has devoted himself to child education.
He took a masters degree in social work and is now leading a silent revolution as a messiah of the disabled, working as an informed citizen.
Is his life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Jawed Ahmed, his dedication and devotion especially on every 3rd December.
I am mentioning just the case of Jawed because of lack of time but such lights of inspiration are prevalent in every corner of the country. They are giving a new lease of life and illuminating the path for others.
3rd December is a day to remember all such people and get inspired by them.
Our country is very large.
There are many things for which we are dependent on the government.
Be it someone from middle class, lower middle class, dalit, exploited, victim or deprived, they have to continuously be in touch with the government or its various organizations.
In our country there is a network of ASHA workers.
They do a lot of social work in India.
There the people are poor and the area is malaria infested.
The ASHA worker Jamuna Manisingh decided that she will not let anyone die of malaria.
She would go to each household and would be the first one to reach if there was news of fever in any household.
She would put to use the primary training she received and give treatment accordingly.
She would reach out to every household to use mosquito repellent and mosquito nets.
The way we care for our kids and their sound sleep, Jamuna Manisingh would work with the same dedication for the entire village. She fought with Malaria and prepared the entire village to fight against it.
There might be so many Jamuna Mani.
There might be lakhs and lakhs of people around us.
Let us show respect to such individuals.
Such individuals lend power to our nation.
They are partners to the joys and sorrows of others.
I applaud all such ASHA workers through the story of Jamuna Mani.
These e-books are about inspiring stories of Swatch Bharat, health sector and the Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana.
I request you to see it.
Just dont see it, show it to others too.
Read it and may be you may find something to connect with it.
Please do send it to Mygov. in.
Such things do happen though we may miss them, but they are the actual strength of our nation.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to come and become a part of nation building.
My dear countryman, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Climate change, global warming is being discussed at every nook and corner and now it has become an accepted standard for embarking on any new task.
The earths temperature should not rise anymore. This is everyones concern and responsibility too.
And to save us from rising temperatures, the first step is energy conservation.
I had once mentioned to switch off the street lights on a full moon night and enjoy the moonlight for an hour.
One should enjoy the moonlight.
Some friend of mine had sent me a link and I had the opportunity to see it.
Watching her on television it seemed that she did not have much of a chance to get education. But she is doing something which no one would have thought of.
She is utilizing the Solar Energy of the Sun to illuminate the houses of the poor.
She is fighting darkness and bringing light to her own name.
People take the lanterns in the evening and return them in the mornings for recharging.
3-4 per day the entire house is illuminated.
Noor Jehan works the entire day to recharge the lanterns in the solar energy plant.
See what the big people of the world do for climate change. Maybe Noor Jehan can act as an inspiration to many for the kind of work she is doing.
And actually, Noor Jehan means the light of the world.
She is spreading light through her work.
I want to congratulate the Prime Minister for starting a programme MUDRA bank.
The Prime Minister MUDRA fund is about funding the unfunded.
This initiative is yet to achieve the speed that I have aimed for.
And most of the beneficiaries are from the SC, ST, OBC category who want to work hard and run their families independently.
Abhishek has himself narrated his excitement.
I too keep receiving various news.
Someone just told me that there is one Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He received a loan of 8. 5 lakhs from MUDRA scheme.
He started the sewage dress and cleanliness business.
I had told about my cleanliness campaign that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhonsle proved it.
The familys new enterprise started developing.
But I want that this scheme is promoted more.
Our banks should become more sensitized and should help more and more people.
Actually, it is this people who run the economy.
The people engaged in small enterprises give strength to the nations economy.
We want to strengthen these people.
Whatever has happened is good, but more good needs to be done.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October on the Anniversary of Sardar Patel I had discussed about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India).
Conducting such events creates continuous awareness in social life.
Rashtram Jagryam Vyayam: means internal vigilance is the prize of liberty.
This tradition should be followed for national unity.
I want to give Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India) the form of a specific scheme.
I have been told that many suggestions have been received.
I have been told that the participants will all receive a certificate.
Many big prizes have been announced.
I have complete faith that your ideas will be really useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winters are about to start.
But it is also the season to enjoy eating and enjoy dressing.
But I would request you to do exercises.
See how there will be an awakening. And see how your body helps you throughout the day.
So make a good habit in this good season.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
This is the twelfth episode of Mann Ki Baat and in a way it means that we have completed one year.
Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever Mann Ki Baat.
In a democracy the power of the people is of great significance.
This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people.
But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking.
Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual.
My experience of Mann Ki Baat made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them.
I asked for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them.
But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs.
This in itself is a great power.
In the same way Mann Ki Baat became a platform to express the power of society.
I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became.
The whole world was amazed.
Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters. What dignity did it lend to our daughters
Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughters confidence but also made a commitment to themselves.
Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters.
People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India.
Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage.
I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled.
Now see, there was no government advertisement.
Nor were lakhs and crores spent.
A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.
And I had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy.
I saw on T. V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy.
The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy. But then they did give up their subsidy.
Isnt it a silent revolution
There is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society.
They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country.
This time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country - be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
This is a pleasant experience in itself.
People of all age groups have sent messages.
I listened to some message personally and I liked them.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive.
Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude, this is the nations greatest wealth.
There were serious complaints in about 1-2 phone calls.
And among them especially from the kin of visually impaired, they made quite a number of phone calls.
The reason may be that they are not able to watch T. V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio.
This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people.
I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message.
I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it.
Please hear what he wants to say-My name is Pawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar, Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces.
The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies. We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965.
What was it that was not there The entire history has been brought to life.
At that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war, those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers, which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition.
Whether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers.
This exhibition will last a few days.
I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it.
Look at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry.
We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness.
I even have to listen to a lot of things people say things like Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened
Look at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this.
This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment thats building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness. This will also compel the governments to work.
The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government - everybody will have to work on this.
We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
He once said, if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later.
Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom.
Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.
My dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us.
You pick any date, you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history.
We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.
Its the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi. I had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing, all kinds of fabric, a lot of things, but you must also own Khadi.
It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali.
Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale.
A lot of the poor have been benefitted.
Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help.
This is the power of the masses and this is why I request you to come forward and help once again.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing.
I wish to share this joy with you as well.
I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything.
I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash babus family members.
You can imagine how happy I must have been on hearing this news.
Netajis family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Ministers residence for the first time.
More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Ministers residence to offer its hospitality.
More than 50 family members of Subhash babus family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting.
I received a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to the way she speaks, her voice, I felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voters registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government.
Thank you Bhargavi talked about registering the names in the voters list and the voting process.
In a democracy, every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually.
Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years.
Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies.
It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do.
I hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voters list yet, get themselves registered and must vote too.
I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food.
This is a holy act, everyone must do it.
I have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday.
I met many people there but these two kids I met have told me something that I want to share with you today.
At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics.
I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments.
He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not.
Similarly, I met a small girl named, Sonam Patel.
She is 9 years old.
I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi.
When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old.
Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well
Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening. If she picks history, she knows everything by the evening.
He told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has.
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes, kids become obsessed with celebrities, Sonam did not have any such obsessions.
I felt this girl is God-gifted.
Sandeep ji, what all will you make me do
I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly program, have to make adjustments to my time-table.
Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so.
Mann Ki Baat in a way has completed a year.
Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio
He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio.
He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin.
English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.
I listen to you, I think for you, I look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through Akashvani.
I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction.
I have the opportunity to be amongst you to share my Mann Ki Baat once again.
Far south, the people are engrossed in Onam festivities and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The government of India has launched various schemes of social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers.
I had made a humble request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift.
The preliminary information that I have, notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme.
And I have been told that almost half the beneficiaries are women, the mothers and the daughters.
Today when I talk to you, I want to mention that around a year back the Jan Dhan Yojana was started at a large scale.
A task which could not be achieved in the past 60 years, would it be possible to achieve it in such a small span of time
The youth have got employment this way.
You will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect the Banking sector, Economy and the Poor People, over 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy camps have been organized.
Now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank.
I would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and I would like to request the poor brethren who have opened an account to never severe this relationship.
These are your banks and now you should never leave them.
I have brought them to you, now it is your job to keep them going.
All of our accounts should be kept active.
I have the faith that you will definitely continue operating the bank accounts.
In the past few days the events in Gujarat, the violence unsettled the entire country.
It is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of Mahatma and Sardar Patel, then the nation is definitely shocked and hurt.
But in a very short span of time, the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in Gujarat brought the entire situation under control.
They played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again Gujarat started its peaceful march.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the right way forward. We have to walk together towards the path of development.
Development is the key to our problems.
Sometime back, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
And truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played.
Their choice of words, their way of talking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, its sublimity, its lyricism, I could experience it all.
I felt very nice.
I think it has become imperative to present Islam in its true form to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit Islam.
And I would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows, we should definitely experience Sufism once.
I am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Various Buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at Bodh Gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level.
I have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and I am glad to be invited at Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India visited Bodh Gaya.
And now, I will be going there with these scholars, this gives me immense happiness.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I would again like to especially share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me speak in the parliament, in public forums or Mann Ki Baat about it.
I have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of Land Acquisition Act, on which a debate is going on.
I have reiterated again and again that I am open to any suggestion in the interest of the farmers.
But today, I want to tell all my farmer brothers and sisters that the request to reform the Land Acquisition Act was raised by the states very emphatically.
But I saw how the framers were being misled and a fear psychosis created.
My dear farmers, you should not be misled and definitely never be scared.
And I do not wish to give anyone the opportunity to mislead you and scare you.
For me, every single voice in the nation is important but most important to me is the voice of the farmer.
I have decided that let this ordinance be lapsed.
This means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government.
But in the same act, there was a job which was incomplete.
This job was related to 13 points which were to be completed within a year and so we brought the ordinance, but due to these disputes the issue got stuck.
The guiding mantra is the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers.
That is why I declared on 15th August that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created.
We are steadily working on it.
So my dear farmers there is no need to be misled now and especially there is no need for you to fear anything.
Do not be scared even if someone tries to scare you.
I have to say something more.
Two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war.
And whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also but natural that we remember his slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is also natural that we remember our Jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our Tricolor Flag.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war. I pay my tribute to the brave soldiers.
May we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history.
I had the opportunity to hear them and I was very happy to know that India is doing commendable research in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing some excellent work.
And I saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat I had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science.
After this meeting I felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace.
Information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews.
These days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in India.
24 countries from across the globe discussed on the Indian soil a Call to Action to reduce Maternal Mortality and Infant Mortality rates.
It was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside America.
And it is true that in our country about 50,000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year.
This is a cause of worry and these figures are scary.
Although a lot of improvement has taken place. India is being appreciated at the International level for its efforts but this statistics is not low.
Like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality.
The world has accepted this.
But we still have to work to save our mothers and our children.
Dear countrymen, there is news of dengue everywhere.
It is true that dengue is dangerous but prevention of dengue is easier.
It is directly related to the Swatch Bharat Campaign that I talk about.
We watch the advertisement on TV but do not pay attention. There are advertisements in the newspapers but it escapes our attention.
There are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water.
A lot of Public Education Programmes are being conducted but we do not pay attention.
We feel that we live in very good houses with proper arrangements being totally unaware that water is collecting at some location in the house and that we are inviting dengue.
I would request you all that do not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
A little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death, which I believe is not right.
In the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue cases absolutely free of cost.
It is necessary to get ourselves tested on time to save precious lives.
Cooperation from all of you is very important for this menace.
And cleanliness should be given great importance.
From Raksha Bandhan to Diwali there will be many festivals.
You will see how a tradition becomes your habit.
My dear countrymen I want to share good news with you.
Like I said we may not get a chance to die for our nation, but we can be fortunate to live for the country.
There are two young brothers and that too from Nashik in our own state of Maharashtra. Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, both with a keen desire to help our tribal population.
These two brothers have brought pride to the nation.
In America a difficult cycle race of about 4800 kms known as Race Across America is organized.
I would like to congratulate both these brothers and send my best wishes.
But I was happier to know that they do all this for their campaign Team India Vision for Tribals.
See everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward.
And this it, when you hear such things the heart swells with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception.
The old generation feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this has been going on for ages.
I have met so many youth who have taken the pledge Sunday on Cycle.
Some say that I keep one day a week as Cycle-Day as it is good for my health.
It is good for the environment.
And I enjoy my youth too.
Nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use.
But this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment.
And today when two youths of my country made India proud in the US, I thought of it worth mentioning.
Today I especially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The task for erecting a memorial for Baba Sahib Ambedkar in the Indu Mill compounds had been stuck for long.
But along with this, the house in UK where Baba Saheb lived 10 King Henry Road has been purchased too.
The globetrotting Indians on their trip to UK can visit the memorial being erected by the Maharashtra government.
It will be inspirational to many.
I congratulate the Maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks.
This year the rains have started on a good note.
This will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops.
I am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all.
We have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
Poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food.
The good news for me is that there has been an increase of approximately 50 in the production of pulses and an increase of around 33 in the production of oilseeds.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land, our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree.
Kargil war was not limited to just our borders, but each of our cities, villages contributed in this war.
This war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border.
It is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world.
Our pledge was to promote citizen participation in democracy and connect every citizen in the development work. And today I am pleased to share this after one year that nearly two crore people have visited MyGov website.
Akhilesh Vajpayee from Kanpur is to provide separate quota to the disabled for booking tickets on IRCTC website.
Though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously.
But on the suggestion of our brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters.
We are receiving quite positive suggestions on MyGov, it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos, tag-lines and formulating policies by yourselves.
We are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system.
We are experiencing a new sense of consciousness.
I am even receiving suggestion on MyGov that what should be my speech on 15th of August.
We have received quite a few suggestions from Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai in this regard.
You can send in your suggestions through MyGov, letters to Radio or write letters to the PMs office.
Look, I believe that this will be a great initiative to include peoples suggestion in framing my speech for 15th August.
I believe that you will send your good suggestions.
Two days ago a visual of an accident in Delhi caught my attention, wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident.
He did not receive any help from the passers-by.
My heart shivers when I look at the statistics of accidents.
We are witnessing an accident every minute in our country.
Due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country.
It is a matter of huge concern that out of these deaths, nearly one third of the victims comprise the youth ranging from 15 to 25 years of age group, and such death shakes the very foundation of an entire family.
The government system will continue to work towards this but I would like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the Safety Rules pertaining to driving a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety.
We have seen few lines written at the back of auto-rickshaws, Papa, come home early and after reading it we are so touched by it.
And therefore I say that the government has taken a lot of new initiatives in this regard, be it the initiative of education on Road Safety, initiative related to road engineering or of enforcement of road safety laws and the discussion on Emergency Care to be provided post accidents. We are going to implement Road Transport and Safety Bill to adopt these safety measures in our country.
In the coming days, we are also planning to take many important measures for implementing National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
We have undertaken another project called Cashless Treatment in Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mundiya national highway and it will be further extended.
The Cashless Treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident one need worry if one has money or not, who will pay the bills, leaving all this worry one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospital facilities at the earliest.
We have started a toll-free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents.
Sometimes I say that the government employees to be Karma Yogis or selfless workers.
I recalled a few incidents in the last few days which I liked and hence would like to share with you.
Vijay Biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies, interests or skills.
Who knows, Vijay Biswals work may get recognised by his paintings across the nation in the near future.
I have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, they are influencing all the brothers to gift toilet to their sisters, so that all the mothers and sisters of the district avoid going to toilet in the open.
I came across a news a few days back and these small news really gives me immense pleasure and I would like to share the same with you.
There exists a small village called Keshla in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh.
The inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village.
Now, nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open.
After the completion of this campaign, the entire village celebrated this accomplishment just like a mega festival.
These finest examples coming up to me show how our society is bringing change in human values and human mind and how the citizens of this country are taking the nation forward.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written to me on the North-East related issues and problems. I must say that North-East people are quite active.
I really appreciate that they write about a lot of issues.
I would like to tell them with great pleasure that we have a separate ministry for North-Eastern region.
During the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as our Prime Minister, a DONER Ministry called Development of North-East Region was formed.
After our government was formed, the DONER Department took an important decision of not staying in Delhi and working from centre for the North-East regions
Instead it was decided to send the government officials and their team on a seven days camp to North-East states like Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim.
This is a great initiative to go far-off from Delhi to East, and this act is called Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, we are extremely delighted and proud of the Mars Mission success.
Indias PSLV C-28 has launched five UK satellites, which are the heaviest satellites launched by India till date.
Such news remain in the flashlight for few moments and are gone.
We often do not remember these achievements for a long time.
I am often worried by this thought that we speak to the youth of our nation and ask about their dream job, only one out of 100 would express their interest in becoming a scientist.
Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India has initiated a National Discovery Campaign.
Today, the villagers have to go to other villagers for charging their mobile phones.
The villages should be provided with all the facilities that are available in the cities.
For this purpose, we have launched Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
We have to run for the development of the Poor.
We will certainly achieve this.
Today, through Mann ki Baat, I felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts.
In a way, in our country the months of August and September are the months for celebration of festivals.
There are lots of festivals in these months.
My greetings to all of you for the same.
Please do send your suggestions for 15th August.
Your opinions will really help me.
Thank you very much to you all
When Isaid that, I had never imagined that it would get such an immense response.
Lakhs of people have posted photos on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
be it of architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers or seas.
Government of India had never thought that in terms of tourism you all could contribute in such a massive way.
I liked some pictures so much that I re-tweeted them.
And as I understand, if some one would not have posted the picture of Belum caves in Andhra Pradesh many people would have never come to know that something like that exists in our country.
But the scene that was witnessed on 21st June was such that wherever the sun dawned, wherever its rays reached, there was not a single landmass wherein it was not welcomed by way of Yoga.
We can say with conviction that the sun never sets in the world of Yoga practitioners.
The way Yoga was received and was welcomed with open arms around the world, there would not be any Indian who would not be proud of it.
I too got delighted.
And when the people of France chose River Seine and Eiffel Tower in which they take pride to do Yoga, they gave an equal status to it as River Siene and Eifel Tower.
In New York people did yoga at Times Square.
If we think about Sydney, Australia then the picture of Opera House comes to our mind.
The citizens of Australia gave equal respect to yoga and did yoga at the Opera House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley or Milans Duomo Cathedral it is a matter of great pride for us.
On 21st June when I saw Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, UN Secretary General doing yoga at UN Headquarters, I was really delighted.
Similarly, UN Peace Keeping Force did a spectacular display of Yoga.
In India, our soldiers too were doing yoga in Siachen on white sheet of snow and on sea too, wherever our naval ships are posted, the yoga program was being carried out by Indian Navy.
Delhi made it to the Guinness Book of World Records .
It seemed as if that from every corner of the world, there was a new inquisitiveness, new joy, new hope and new connection.
Few days back, when I tweeted a photo of a Vietnamese child doing yoga, it was such a sweet photo that it got a lot of attention from the entire world.
Everybody, be it men-women, old-young, village-city, developed or developing countries, everybody got connected with it.
Yoga in true terms, became the core reason to connect the entire world.
I do not know how the intellectual class, elites of the world would analyze this event. But I can feel and every Indian can experience that the whole world is very curious to know more about India.
Curiosity towards India has increased.
The world wants to know about the values, the rituals and the heritage of India.
It is our responsibility that without any artificiality we share our legacy and introduce ourselves to the world.
We can only do this when we ourselves are proud of our traditions.
At times, we are so familiar with our values that we dont feel there is anything new in them but we ourselves do not know that our family values are considered to be a big thing in the entire world.
Why dont we familiarize the outside world with our family values
I am sure, they would be intrigued. There are many things that our forefathers have given to us which are the best and the entire world also has the right on those things.
The success of International Yoga day has brought in a new responsibility along with it.
It is our responsibility that we gift supreme Yoga teachers to the world.
One database must be prepared and I believe you can do it.
I have seen and learnt from the perspective of recent occurrences that a government that works and the government that is action-oriented can bring in results if the targets are set.
We should not forget that the only voice that could be heard one year ago was that nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
Can you imagine that there is a department under Government named Ayush.
Nobody has paid attention towards this department.
The only mention Ayush in some corner of the newspaper being a small department is once in 2 to 5 years. But it led on the International Yoga Day.
Therefore, this is an example that if there is an aim then even a small department can do a supreme job.
In the last few days, the world saw how we saved people from Yemen to Afghanistan.
In a few hours-, we reached Nepal and helped people over there.
When people wanted to open an bank account under the Governments new scheme of Jan Dhan Yojana, how the people working in bank helped them to do so and connected millions of Indians to the bank.
On 15th August last year, when I appealed from the Red Fort for toilets in schools, I had said that by next 15th August we have to complete this task.
The work which could not be completed in last 60 years was promised to be completed by the end of one year.
This means that the Government, people and Government workers, all want to work for the country.
Last month, we had launched three Insurance schemes.
In such a short time span more than 10 crore people have become a part of these schemes but we have to take it further.
Rakshabandhan comes in the month of August.
Cant we start a massive movement before this festival and make every women, be it our mother or sister, a part of this, thereby giving benefit to them under this Insurance program.
This can be a big gift for a sister from their brother.
Whenever I hold a Mann ki Baat session, many people send me suggestions.
This time many people have suggested that I say something about the monsoons.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji from Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji have all asked me to say something about the monsoon in this session of Mann ki Baat.
And each one of us, whatever the age is...
definitely tempted to enjoy the first showers of the monsoon.
I am sure, you too might be enjoying the rains with bhajiyas, pakoras, corn and a hot cup of tea.
Just as the rays of the sun give us life, similarly rainfall provide us life and sustenance.
Every drop of water is precious.
As a responsible citizen and as a member of the society, we will have to cultivate the habit of conserving every drop of water.
It should be our pledge that water from the villages stays in the villages and water for the cities remains available for them.
Rain water harvesting is not a new concept. It is being practiced over the centuries.
Be it check dams, watershed development, small lakes or the small ponds in fields, we need to save the precious waters everywhere.
Porbander is a coastal city, so potable water was collected through the rains for the entire year.
Even in those times such a lot of care was taken.
We can too do the same.
And I can take a leaf from my personal experience and offer you a suggestion which has been very successful.
This is an intensely rural technology.
Whenever you sow a plant, place an earthen pot near it.
You just need to fill it once or twice in a month.
You will see how fast the plant grows into a lush green tree.
I have even been telling the farmers to plant trees on the boundaries of their fields instead of putting barricades.
We all know that rains cause many water borne diseases.
Increased moisture in the environment leads to bacterial growth and so, keeping the environment clean becomes important.
Cleanliness is very important in monsoons.
It is often requested to consume safe drinking water.
And this is true that the more care we take, healthier we would be.
We need monsoons and we need water but we also need to stay healthy.
Dear citizens, we have recently launched three schemes for the people in the cities.
We have around 500 small cities.
We have to take this movement forward.
And yet at the same time, the poorest of poor person should have an accommodation of his own and that too complete with water, electricity, sanitation and access to a school.
In 2022 when India celebrates its 75 years of Independence, we wish that every Indian has a house of his own.
I am myself connected to you via the social media.
I keep getting many new suggestions and new ideas and also good and bad information about our government.
But you cant imagine the force that is lent to the programme when a village or a society adopts it.
A few days back a Sarpanch in a small remote village of Haryana, Sri Sunil Jaglan ji launched Selfie with Daughter campaign.
Such an environment was created that every father wished to click a selfie of himself with his daughter and post it on the social media.
In Haryana, the number of girls in comparison to boys is dismally low.
Around another 100 districts in the country have a similar dismal situation of skewed sex ratio.
But it is the worst in Haryana.
I request you all to take a selfie with your daughter and post it on selfie with daughter.
And do not forget to post a tagline around the theme of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao with it, whatever be the language it can be in Hindi, English, your mother tongue or your native language.
And I promise to re-tweet the most inspirational tagline with you and your daughters selfie.
We can turn Beti Bachao Beti Padhao into a mass movement.
Make our country clean and green.
And I say this from my experience. Please take this forward.
Make Yoga a part of your life.
And that initiative regarding Incredible India, do keep posting a picture of whichever part of the country you go to.
The country and the world will awaken to our diversity.
I felt that the handicrafts did not receive due attention.
Do make it a point to post the handicrafts of the local region you visit.
There are so many things that people around you might be making, the poor as well as the skilled might be creating.
We have an easy medium at our disposal and so we will all do it.
My dear countrymen, that is all for today.
I shall meet you again in the next edition of Mann ki Baat.
Many people expect me to announce some huge schemes during this programme.
But I am working day and night towards those.
This is my time for some light conversation with you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this period must have made one feel.
when I express myself through Mann Ki Baat, the one speaking is me, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but the story is yours, the Purusharth pertaining to your pursuits and goals is yours, the Parakram, the achievement is yours.
But this Sunday has made one wait endlessly
Anyway, finally the opportunity has dawned.
In a family like atmosphere, these plain, simple reflections become the reason for change in life, in society. Begetting a new spirit, in a way fortifying the spirit of New India, let us wish this endeavour embarks upon its onward journey.
For me, this nonvocal conversation with you was a part of my feelings during my spiritual journey.
Amidst hectic Election engagements, many people asked me a flurry of questions on why I had gone up to Kedarnath.
You have every right I can understand your curiosity...
and I too feel that my sentiments reach you.
But today, I think, if I change the course of the conversation that way, the entire complexion of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Amidst the rigours of the Election, speculations on victory or defeat, before the polling was yet to start I undertook the journey.
Most people have derived political conclusions out of that.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet myself.
In a way, I undertook the journey to meet my inner self.
WHEN, I cant say, but Ill do it for sure. You have every right as far as I am concerned.
The way people have expressed their wish to know about Kedar, I feel a similar effort on your part to lay emphasis on positive things, which I get to know through your expressions.
There are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process.
People bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society they also come out with solutions for the same.
I have seen for myself that in their letters, people go to great lengths in describing their problems it is fascinating to see that in the same breath, they express directly or indirectly, a relevant solution or two, one suggestion or the other, or even an idea
If someone refers to sanitation and cleanliness, he or she invariably voices angst against filth dirt, but on the same page appreciates efforts being under way to ensure cleanliness.
When somebody talks about the environment, one can easily sense his or her crucial concerns on the matter
at the same time, experiments that the person has attempted or seen also come to the surface, with vivid descriptions of new ideas on the issue.
This means, I can closely get a fair idea of your point, in terms of extrapolating a solution to a certain problem on a society- wide scale.
Mann Ki Baatis like a mirror to the country our society.
It conveys to us that there is no dearth of inner fortitude, strength talent within our countrymen.
The need of the hour is to synergise those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that a 130 crore countrymen wish to be, strongly and actively, a part of the nations progress.
I receive a lot of letters and phone calls in Mann Ki Baat, but the element of complaint is negligible and I would like to tell you that in the last five years, I have not come across a single instance where somebody has asked for something for personal gain.
Just imagine... a person writing to the Prime Minister of the country, but seeking nothing for ones own self...
it is a reflection on the lofty collective demeanour of crores of people in the country.
My heart is filled to the brim with joy today.
And that is why in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, then, I effortlessly said that I would be back after a few months.
With this sentiment, come, lets take Mann Ki Baat forward.
When Emergency was imposed on the country, resistance against it was not limited to the political arena or politicians
Day and night, when one gets to eat food on time, one doesnt realize what hunger pangs are.
Similarly, in day to day life, it is difficult to savour the joy of democratic rights, unless they are snatched away.
And it was not just on account of the fact that the constitution of India has made certain provisions that enabled Democracy to blossom.
Of course, in order to ensure smooth conduct of the social order, a constitution is required...
And precisely for that, the country sacrificed one full Election, not for her own sake, but for the sake of protecting democracy.
Just recently, our country celebrated a mega festival of democracy, a mammoth Election Campaign, from the rich to the poor, all were happily eager in this festival to decide the fate of their country.
When something is in close proximity of us, we tend to underestimate its importance
In the 2019 Loksabha Election, India saw over 61 crore voters exercising their franchise...
We can think of this figure as one ordinary but if I place it in a global perspective, if you exclude China, the number of people who voted in India exceeds the population of any other country in the world.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Election is more than the entire population of America, close to double the figure.
The total number of voters in India exceeds the entire population of Europe.
This stands for the sheer size spread of our Democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election in history by far, was the largest democratic Election ever held in the world.
You can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise.
Lakhs of teachers, officers staff strived day night to make it possible.
In order to successfully conclude this Mahayagya, on the one hand, whereas close to three lakh paramilitary personnel discharged their duty on the other, 20 lakh Police personnel of various states too, persevered with due diligence.
It is on account of these people that this time voting took place on a larger scale compared to the previous Election.
For the voting, there were around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines... you can imagine the gargantuan task
All this was done, just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, just for a lone woman voter, a polling station was created.
You will be amazed to know that it took a journey of two days for personnel of the Election Commission, just to reach there...
this is honour to democracy at its best.
The worlds highest located polling station too, is in India.
At an altitude of 15,000 feet, it is located in the Lahaul Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides this, there is another fact pertaining to these Elections, that swells our hearts with pride.
Perhaps, this is the first time ever, that women have enthusiastically voted, as much as men did.
This time the ratio of men women who voted was almost the same.
Another encouraging fact is that, today, there are a record 78 women Members of Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person connected with the electioneering process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you may often have heard me say No bouquet, just a book
I had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies.
The other story that touched the core of my heart was Eidgah...
the sensitivity of a young lad, his unsullied love for his grandmother, such maturity at that early age
When 4-5 years old Hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs, indeed, it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle.
The concluding line of this story makes one very emotional since it holds a vital truth about life, Young Hamid played the role of aged Hamid aged Ameena had turned into child Ameena.
Another such poignant story is 'Poos Ki Raat'.
In this story, the living depiction of the paradoxes in a poor farmer's life is seen.
Halku the farmer is happy even after his crops are destroyed by frost, because now he will not be forced to sleep in his fields in the cold winter.
Though these stories were written about a century ago but remain relevant all the same even today.
After reading these stories, I felt myself to be empathetic.
Now that we are conversing about reading, then in some extension of media, I had read about the Akshara Library in Kerala.
You will be surprised to learn that this library lies in a village nestling within the dense forests of Idukki.
A Primary school teacher, P.
Chinnathampi who runs a small tea shop, have between them worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here stuffed in sacks and carried on the back.
Today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path.
The Vaanche Gujarat campaign carried out in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Participants hailing from every age group in lakhs, participated in this campaign to read books.
I will still urge you in today's digital world and in the time of Google Guru, to take some time out from your daily routine and devote it to the book.
You will really enjoy it a lot and do write about whichever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat' also get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues, which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water.
Water is of great importance in our culture.
Rigveda's Apah Suktam says this about water: , , , , , Meaning that it is water which is the life force and also, the source of energy.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country.
Just and just 8
Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem.
I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.
Therefore keeping the importance of water in mind, a new Jalashakti ministry has been created in the country.
This will allow faster decision-making on all subjects related to water.
A few days ago I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans across the country.
That in order to save water, to collect water, to save the very drops of the rainwater, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers.
I am happy that they have shown exemplary enthusiasm on this front and on 22nd of this month crores of people contributed free labour, Shramdaan across thousands of panchayats.
People in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater.
Today, I want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme.
Come lets listen to what the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katakmasandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has to say to all of us through this message:DILIP KUMAR RAVIDASThis is Birsa Munda's land, where cohabiting in harmony with nature is a part of the culture.
The people here, once again, are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
For my part I wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism.
There are several Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation.
As Ive said, a collective effort begets massive positive results.
But the goal remains the same, and that is to save water and adopt water conservation.
The drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort would rid of the problem of water logging.
The construction of the water-tank in Telangana's Thimmaipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about the collective endeavour in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about those women of Garhwal, who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting.
Today, through the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, I am entreating 3 requests to the fellow countrymen.
My first request is that just like cleanliness drive has been given the shape of a mass movement by the countrymen, let's also start a mass movement for water conservation.
We together should all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is God's prasad to us, water is like philosopher's stone
Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water.
Whether it be from the world of films, sports, our friends in the media, people belonging to social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as Katha - Kirtan, everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion.
We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour.
Youll see, we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes.
Come let us join water conservation, and involve ourselves in making a list of more and more innovative methods to motivate people to conserve water.
You can all share your content using the JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag.
My dear countrymen, I must express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing
On 21st June, once again, Yoga Day was celebrated together with fervor and enthusiasm, there were instances of three-four generations of each family coming together to participate on Yoga Day.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care has enhanced the glory of yoga and Yoga day.
In any corner of the world, yoga enthusiast welcomes the sun as soon it rises and then there is the complete journey ending with sunset.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective nations.
On that day, the world appeared to be like one big happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive denizens are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures this very principle.
Therefore promotion of Yoga is a great example of social service.
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Minister's Awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award would be bestowed on those organizations around the world, whose significant and unique contributions in the promotion of yoga you cannot even imagine
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan', which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and conducts various training courses.
If there is a topic related to yoga, then can Indians lag behind others
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured.
Similarly, Swami Rajarsrhi Muni the founder of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University was also honoured.
The widespread celebration of Yoga and honouring those missionaries taking Yoga to the doorsteps of the common folk made this Yoga day special.
My dear countrymen, were embarking on a new journey from today armed with new emotions, new realizations, new resolve and renewed vigour.
The process of linking with your thoughts through Mann Ki Baat as a medium is a very important and personal journey for myself.
May your blessings remain there for me
You are my inspiration and you are my energy
Let's sit together and while enjoying Mann Ki Baat try to fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Once again next month we will meet again for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I Thank all of you once again. Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
I begin Mann Ki Baat today with a heavy heart.
10 days ago, Mother India had to bear the loss of many of her valiant sons.
We shall have to take up this challenge facing our country, forgetting all barriers of casteism, communalism, regionalism and other difference, so that, our steps against terror are firmer, stronger and more decisive.
Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished.
The Army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers.
The martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore, through the media, touching, inspiring stories of their kin, which give hope and strength to the entire country.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjan ji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF.
When the mortal remains of Martyr Vijay Soren, draped in the tricolor reached Gumla, Jharkhand, his innocent son iterated that he too would join the armed forces.
The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each every child of the Nation today.
My dear countrymen, the rather long wait after Independence for a War Memorial is about to be over.
It is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty ji of Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness on the completion of the National War Memorial.
India not having a National War Memorial used to surprise me, pain me...
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on the 29th of February.
All of you know that this day comes just once in four years.
A simple, peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders.
In Independent India, the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by Morarji bhai Desai.
Morarji Desai steered the course of the country through some difficult times, when the very democratic fabric of the country was under a threat.
To save democracy, Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against imposition of Emergency.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price in his old age.
The government of that time arrested and incarcerated him.
But when the Janata Party won the general elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his tenure, the 44th constitutional amendment was introduced.
This was important because the 42nd amendment which was brought during the emergency, curtailed the powers of the Supreme Court and implemented provisions which stood to violate our democratic values, was struck down.
The 44th amendment, made it mandatory that the proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies were made public through the newspapers.
This amendment, restored certain powers of Supreme Court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abrogated during the Emergency.
Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
My beloved countrymen, this year too, there was a great buzz about the Padma award.
I would like to tell you about some of these people.
Take the case of Abdul Ghafoor Khatri of Gujarat, who has done an amazing job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting form of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation.
I had gifted a Rogan painting titled 'Tree of Life' done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
The manner he has spent his entire life in the service of Gau-mata, is unique in itself.
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who at first tried to empower the downtrodden and the exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based micro financing.
Even at the age of 100, she is training yoga to people from all over the world and till now has trained 1500 as yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famous nicknamed 'Lady Tarzan' in Jharkhand, most valiantly took on the Timber Mafia and Naxalites, and not only saved the 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to unite and protect the trees and wildlife.
It is a tribute to Jamuna ji's diligence that today, on the birth of every child, villagers plant 18 trees. Also, 10 trees are planted on the marriage of a girl in the village.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagali of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration despite being a divyang herself, it is difficult to find an example than what Muktaben did for the upliftment of divyang women by establishing the institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, through the medium of which she has been engaged in a virtuous endeavour to make visually challenged children self-reliant.
She not only trained the women of the village in pursuing other gainful means of employment, but most importantly she integrated technology with agriculture and my dear countrymen, it has perhaps happened for the first time, that in the roll of Padma awards bestowed this year, 12 farmers have been the recipients.
Generally, very few people associated with the agricultural world or those very few who can be labeled as real farmers have ever found their name in the list of Padmashree awards.
This in itself presents the live and vibrant image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which Ive been wanting to do past few days.
At present, whenever Im touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of PMJAY scheme under Ayushman Bharats umbrella.
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakh impoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
In fact this scheme is meant for the benefit of such underprivileged people.
My dear countrymen, exam time in schools throughout the nation is soon going to dawn upon us.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students whore going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the recording of this entire event on YouTube, and I take this opportunity to wish all the best to all my exam warriors, for their upcoming examinations.
My dear countrymen, no mention of India can be complete without citing its festivals.
It is just not possible that a day passes without any significance associated with it, or does not herald a festival Our culture has a continuum spread over many millennia and it is a part of our heritage.
In a few days from now, Mahashivrartri will be celebrated, and that too on a Monday, and when a Shivratri falls on a Monday, it becomes all that special in our heart of our hearts

My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you, courtesy the Mann Ki Baat program has been a really wonderful experience for me.
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.

This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.

On my visit to Kranti Mandir, Red Fort, as I was reflecting on memories of Netaji, his family members gifted me a special cap.
There was a time when Netaji used to wear it.
I dedicated that cap to the museum itself, for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar islands.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Through his clarion calls Dilli Chalo, Tum mujhe Khoon do, main tumhe azadi doonga, Netaji secured a special place in every Indians heart.
That files associated with Netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years.
And I am happy that we could manage to do the same.
I remember the day when Netajis family paid a visit to the Prime Ministers residence.
I am told this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto Urdu languages.
Vyas ji played a vital role.
The museum has 4 historical exhibitions which display more than 450 paintings and artworks which are of three centuries vintage.
Exquisite works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
He had painted upon many themes.
He did paintings of many animals and birds, he also painted many landscapes, and not only that he also tried to depict many human characters by etching them on canvas.
And the most unique aspect was that Gurudev Tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works.
He believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality, from his own perspective, understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting.
His paintings have been on display in European countries, in Russia and in America.
I hope you will go and see his paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is a land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds.

Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is Exam Season.

I wish all the students, their parents and teachers all the best.
I would have liked to discuss this topic at length in Mann Ki Baat of today, but you will be happy to know that just after a gap of two days ,on January 29, at 11 am, in the 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I am going to interact with students from all over the country, and this time, along with the students, their parents and teachers are also going to be part of this program.
In this 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I will touch upon a lot of things related to all the facets of examinations with my young friends, especially on the topic of stress free exams.

Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
We shall soon enter 2019.
What exactly should we do in order to ensure a change in our lives, simultaneously contributing our bit in taking our country society forward
Many good wishes to all of you for the year 2019.

By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry
And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, this December we had to bear the loss of some extraordinary, exemplary countrymen.
On the 19th of December, Dr. Jayachandran passed away in Chennai.
SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth.
In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services.
In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri.
There are many exemplary personalities such as Dr. Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society.
Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged.
Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps.
The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise.
Today, Im saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the Swachch Bharat Mission a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.
In this Mahayagya, grand undertaking, the Municipal Corporation, voluntary bodies, School- College students, the people of Jabalpur
com, where I got to read about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever I get the opportunity, I visit the better India website and try to know more about such shining, inspiring deeds.
I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems.
In the same way, you can easily learn the Sanskrit language sitting at home through samskritabharati.
I do believe that by doing so more and more people will get to know about our heroes who brought a change in society.
Spreading negativity is fairly easy. But some really good work is being done around us, in our society. And all this has been possible through the collective efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
Sports has its own significance in every society.
When a game is being played, the spectators too experience a rush of energy in their beings.
Let me tell you about one of our daughters from Kashmir who won a gold medal in a Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future.
Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani.
You too must have read it.
Rajani has won a gold medal at the Junior Womens Boxing Championship.
She did it in honour of her father Jasmer Singh ji who sells lassi, at a stall in Panipat.
According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is.
Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up.
When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could.
Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially.
Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart went ahead with her training in boxing.
She has won a medal in Serbia too.
My best wishes and blessings to Rajani. I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani Ji for supporting encouraging Rajani.
This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle.
She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day.
Just imagine... 300 kms of cycling every day
Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable.
Hardships can never turn into obstacles.
When we come to know of such examples, we too feel inspired every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, the month of January ushers in many festivals filled with hope joy- such as Lohri, Pongal, MakrSankranti, Uttarayan, MaghBihu, Maaghi
on the occasion of these festivities, the length breadth of India will be replete... with the verve of traditional dances at places, the embers of Lohri symbolizing the joy of a bountiful harvest at others.
Somewhere the skies dotted with colourful flying kites, elsewhere the funfilled air of a mela or carnival.
All these festivals may carry different names but the underlying or inherent feeling of celebrating them is singular - these are harvest festivals and somewhere or the other are connected with crops and farming, connected with the farmer, with the village and with our barns.
It is during this period that the sun enters Uttarayan due to Northward movement of the earth on the celestial sphere and enters the Makardasha.
It is during this period that days begin to lengthen and the winter harvesting of our crops begins.
Best wishes to our food providers, the farming brothers and sisters.
Our festivals are replete with fragrance of the essence of Unity in Diversity and the spirit of One India Great India.
We can witness how closely our festivals are interlinked with nature.
In Indian culture society and nature are indistinguishable, in our culture the person and his environment are considered in totality.
A great example of the interconnection between us and Nature is the calendar based on our festivals.
It comprises festivals all around the year as well as the movements of the celestial bodies.
This traditional calendar depicts our bonding with natural and astronomical events.
The lunar and solar Calendars based on the movement of earth with respect to moon and sun decide the occurrence and dates of our festivals.
It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow.
In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals.
GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.
The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals.
Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds.
Millions of people take a dip in the holy rivers on theoccasion of MakarSankranti.
Our festivals, impart to us many social values.
On the one hand, where they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival quite easily in itself teaches the important lesson of life - the value of staying together, imbued with a feeling of brotherhood.
I wish all of you a great year 2019 and do hope that you all to enjoy the oncoming festive season.
Doo share the photographs taken on these festivals with one another so that everyone can witness the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is an abundance of events in our culture, of which we can be proud and display them in the entire world with pride - and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
Even in films, a lot is exhibited regarding its grandeur and magnificence and most truly so, the dimensions ofKumbh are vast supremely divine, as much magnificent.
People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage.
The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started.
It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh.
The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh.
The festival of Kumbh, to be organized in Prayagraj, is expected to have footfalls from more than 150 countries
This can be a huge learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were progressing on a war footing.
People of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This time much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh.
This great symbol of peoples faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of.
Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone.
I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith also become Mahakumbh of ofnationalism.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity regardingthe celebration of RepublicDay on 26th January, when we remember those great men who gave us our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
We are fortunate that South African President Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa is going to grace the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.
Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the 'Mahatma'.
It was in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood rock steady in protest of apartheid.
He also founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the demand for peace and justice echoed to the whole world.
He derivedinspiration and endurancefor spending many years in jail from Bapu himself.
Mandela said this about Bapu - "Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because it was here that he used his first experiment with truth
What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and that of the countrymen, was discussed in detail.
At the same conference, I also announced the awarding of 'Sardar Patel Award' for National Integration to be given to those who have contributed for national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country.
He always remained engaged in keeping India's integrity intact.
SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land.
It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel's aspirations through this award for National Integration.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the date ofthe sacred festival observed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his work was centred in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded.
In a way, entire India received his blessings.
Shri Gobind Singh Ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was a divine figure full of heroism, valor, courage, sacrifice and devotion.
He had beatific knowledge of both weapons andShaastras.
He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages.
I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good events happening in the country, which are not widely discussed.
Many programs are being organized across the country in celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
is engaged in promoting good eating or Safe and Healthy Diet habits.
Under the aegis of "Eat Right India" campaign, Swasth Bharat trips are being carried out across the country.
These campaigns will last till Jan 27th.
A clean and healthy India will spell a prosperous India also.
Nutritious food is most essential for good health.
Whether it is the life of a person, life of a nation, or the lifespan of a society, inspiration, is the basis of progress.
Come, imbued with renewed inspiration, renewed zeal, renewed resolution, new accomplishments, loftier goals lets move on, keep moving, change oneself and change the country too.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
This journey has reached its 50th episode today.
Thus, this Golden Jubilee Episode is indeed gilt-edged in every sense of the term.
Your letters and phone calls this time pertain mostly to these 50 episodes.
Anshu Kumar Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna on similar lines Monica Jain from Delhi, Prosenjit Sarkar from Bardhaman, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur converge in asking a shared question.
Your curiosity is but natural
in this age when Radio was fading into oblivion, why did Modi opt for the airwaves
Said he Sir, just listen to the radio.
Indeed, that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio.
It was then that he elaborated on how on the day of the nuclear test, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced to the Media and how he broke into a dance on listening to it on the radio.
It was matter of great intrigue to me to see a lone tea seller in a remote, snow - clad hilly place, who possibly kept listening to the radio the entire day...
I have been nursing that feeling ever since, acknowledging its power strength.
Hence when I became the Prime Minister, it was natural for me to turn towards a strong, effective medium.
And in 2014, when I took charge as the Pradhan Sevak, Principal Servant, it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our countrys unity, her grand history, her valour, Indias diversity, our cultural diversity, virtues embedded in our society such as Purusharth, Tapasya, Passion sacrifice
Every month, we would read letters to the tune of lakhs, listen to phone calls, watch comments on the App Mygov.
I came across some feedback that is very interesting.
Out of the designated sample in the survey, 70 of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people believe that the greatest contribution of Mann Ki Baat has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society.
The medium of Mann Ki Baat has promoted many a mass revolution.
indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion.
It is a change where people are increasingly willing to contribute for the sake of service to society.
Modi may come and go, but this country will never let go of its UNITY permanence, our culture will always be immortal.
These minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive.
This new inspiration zest will keep taking her to greater heights.
I read a letter then try to weave it with the essence of a similar letter.
I would like to share a couple of personal experiences with you ...
who knows how soon these will reach our families
Who would have imagined that a small campaign selfie with daughter starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well.
Every section of the society including celebrities joined in to ignite a process of transformation in a new modern language of change that the present generation understands and follows.
At times Mann Ki Baat is also sneered at but 130 crore countrymen ever occupy a special pleace in my heart.
Their hearts and my heart beat to the same rhythm.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the Government it is about the society.
In fact, Politics is one of the numerous other aspects of social life.
Making politics an all pervasive, powerful factor is not an effective way for a healthy society.
At times, political developments and political people assume such overriding prominence that other talents and courageous deeds get overshadowed.
For ensuring a bright future for a country such as India, it is our collective responsibility to acknowledge and honour the common mans talent and deeds and Mann Ki Baat is a humble and modest effort in this direction.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat is that one feels like talking to a close acquaintance and not to the Prime Minister, and this is true democracy.
and by calling on this number, people record messages in their own voice.
My effort is that I read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before Mann Ki Baat.
I listen to many phone calls too.
And as the episode of Mann Ki Baat draws closer, I read ideas and inputs sent by you very minutely while travelling.
That letter does not remain a mere a piece of paper for me.
As it is I have spent close to 40 to 45 years as a travelling mendicant and have been to most of the districts in our country including the remotest once where I spent a lot of time.
That is why I am able to relate myself to the place and context of the letter.
Then, I note down facts like the name of the village and of the person.
Honestly speaking, Mann Ki Baat carries my voice but the examples, emotions and spirit represent my countrymen, I thank every person contributing to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of persons whose names I have not been able to include in Mann Ki Baat but without any disappointment, they continue to send in their letters and comments.
I firmly believe that your ideas and your views will continue reaching me in even greater numbers and will help make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, effective and useful.
An effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which, somehow, could not be included in Mann Ki Baat.
I also thank my colleagues from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV Channels and the Social Media.
It is due to their hard work that Mann Ki Baat reaches maximum number of people.
In this way for those 30 minutes they become Narendra Modi.
I congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills.
I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well.
I sincerely thank from the core of my heart my friends in the media who regularly telecast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political person is ever happy with the media, he feels that he is getting a very little coverage or the coverage given to him is negative. But many issues raised in Mann Ki Baat have been adopted by the media.
Without your contribution and cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Nidhi ji, many thanks for your phone call
To tell you the truth, I have no such secret.
What I am doing must be happening in families as well.
In simple words, I may say that I try to cast myself into the mould of that young man, and put myself under his conditions and try to adjust and match the wave length accordingly.
There are old baggages of our own lives and when they do not come in the way, it becomes easier to understand others.
None of the two even realizes that how and when one others has abandoned its idea and accepted and owned the idea of the other side.
Todays youths have this special quality that they wont do anything which they do not believe themselves and whenever they believe in something, they follow that leaving everything else.
People generally talk of a communication gap between the elders and teenagers in the family.
In fact, the scope of discussion with teenagers is quite limited in most of the families.
Most of the time these talks remain limited to studies, habits or life style and the dos and donts.
An open discussion without any expectations is gradually on the decline and this too is a matter of concern.
Communication will be more effective if we accept instead of expect and discuss instead of dismiss.
My effort is to have a continuous dialogue with the youth in various programmes or through social media.
I try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking.
They are storehouse of ideas.
They are extremely energetic, innovative and focused.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time.
I say what is wrong in it.
They do so because they are adept in multitasking.
If we just look around, we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way, may it be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other field.
Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big.
If we put these ideas of our youth into practice and provide them conducive environment to express themselves, they surely will bring about a constructive and a positive change in the country- they are already doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the Constitution Day which falls on the 26th November.
She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption.
Thank you very much for your suggestion Vineeta ji.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
A day to remember those great personalities who drafted our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to accomplish this stupendous task of drafting the Constitution.
Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years.
The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today.
This also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country, each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution to the country which empowers the people of India and enriches even the poorest of the poor.
The unique point in our Constitution is that the rights and duties have been very comprehensively detailed.
A balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will automatically get protected and similarly if we fulfill our duties, then also our rights will get automatically protected.
I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant.
This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, we shall complete 70 years as a Republic and in 2022, we shall enter 75th year of our Independence.
Let us all take forward the values enshrined in our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His death anniversary or mahaparirvan divas falls on 6th December.
I, on behalf of all countrymen, pay my homage to Baba Saheb who gave the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
Democracy was embedded deep in Baba Sahebs nature and he used to say that Indias democratic values have not been imported from outside.
What is a republic and what is a parliamentary system- are nothing new to India.
He had made a very moving appeal in the Constituent Assembly that we have to safeguard our hard fought democracy till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we, Indians may be from different background but, yes, we shall have to keep the national interest above all the other things.
Once again my humble tribute to revered Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, two days back on 23rd November, we all celebrated Shri Guru Nanak Dev Jayanti and next year in 2019 we shall be celebrating his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, kindness and amity to the society.
The country will observe Guru Nahak Dev Jis 550th birth anniversary in a grand way, its soothing colours will not only spread in India alone but will get sprinkled the world over.
All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well.
Besides, a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
This Gurudwara suffered severe damage due to the devastating earth quake of 2001 in Gujarat. But, the manner in which the local people joined hands with the state Government in renovating it, is an example even today.
The Government of India has taken a significant decision of building Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen could easily visit Kartarpur in Pakistan to pay homage to Guru Nanak Dev Ji at that holy sight.
My dear countrymen, we shall meet once again in the next episode after this 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat and I am sure that in this episode of Mann Ki Baat today I got an opportunity for the first time to talk to you about the spirit behind this programme because of your questions.
But our journey shall continue.
The more you connect with us, our journey will gain greater depth, providing, satisfaction to one and all.
At times a question arises in the minds of peoples as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to say today that of the feedback of this programme, one of the points that touches my heart most- is when people tell me that when we sit with all our family members to listen to Mann Ki Baat, we feel that the head of our family is sitting with us and sharing his ideas with us.
When I heard this comment in a larger circle, I felt satisfied to know that I am yours, I am one amongst you, I am with you, you elevated me and in a way, and in this way I will continue to remain connected with you as a family member through Man Ki Baat.
your ambitions are my ambitions.
Come on, let us take this journey further.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
I urge you to participate in the largest possible numbers in this run for unity.
Six months or so before Independence, on the 27th of January, 1947, the world famous international Magazine Time had a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of that edition.
In their lead story, they had depicted a map of India
There existed over 550 princely states.
The English had lost interest in India they wanted to leave India fragmented into pieces.
Time Magazine had opined that hovering over India then were the dangers of problems like partition, violence, food scarcity, price rise and power-politics. The magazine further observed that amidst that plethora of problems, if there was anyone who possessed the capability to unite the country and heal wounds, it was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji considered Sardar Patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act.
Sardar Patel formulated solutions one by one, weaving the warp weft of unity on the axis of a single thread.
Whether Junagadh, Hyderabad, Travancore, or for that matter the princely states of Rajasthan, if we are able to see a United India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel.
It is but natural for us to solemnly remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India.
The 31st of October this year will be special on one more account- on this day, we shall dedicate the statue of unity of the nation as a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.
This is the worlds tallest scyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud to see the worlds tallest statue here on Indian soil.
I am sure this will turn out to be a described destination for one all across the country.
This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression.
This incident too is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the celebrated Army officer sam Manekshaw.
In that interview, field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was reminiscing on times when he was a Colonel.
Around this time, military operations commenced in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw has mentioned how in a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was irked on the delay in sending troops to Kashmir During the proceedings, Sardar Patel gave him a characteristic glance and reiterated that there should be no delay in our Army operation and that a solution should be sought swiftly.
The 31st of October also is the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt love sports
Elements like spirit, strength, skill, stamina are extremely important in the world of sports.
They are the ultimate test for a sportspersons mettle...
all four of these virtues form the core foundation of nation building universally.
If the youth of a country possess these qualities, that country will progress not only in areas such as Economy and Science Technology but also bring laurels home in the field of sports.
Just recently I had two memorable meetings.
First, I got an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held at Jakarta.
These athletes bagged a tally of 72 medals, creating a new, unprecedented record, bringing glory to the nation.
At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events.
You may recall that even, in the recent Asian Games, Indias performance was par excellence.
Have you observed the way I have frequently used terms such as the best ever or new, unprecedented record
When he turned eight he lost his father.
Then he spent another eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries.
The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events.
Hitherto, India had never won a medal in a Judo event, at the junior or senior level. But Tabaabi Devi created history by bagging the silver medal at the youth Olympics.
16 year old player Tabaabi Devi hails from a village in Manipur.
Her father is a labourer and mother a fish-seller.
There were times when the family had no money to buy food.
Even such hardships were not able to cow down her zest devotion.
And she has created history by winning a medal for the country.
Every life, every being is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportspersons passion dedication is the hallmark of New India.
My dear countrymen, you may recall that we had successfully organized FIFA Under- 17 World Cup in the year 2017.
The whole world acclaimed this as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under -17 World Cup had created a record in terms of the number of viewers on the ground.
More than 12 lakh enthusiasts enjoyed the romance of Football matches in various stadia across the country and boosted the morale of the young players.
This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December.
Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
India has won gold medals in various tournaments and has been the World Champion once.
India has produced many great hockey players.
Whenever there will be reference to Hockey,the story will remain incomplete without a mention of these legends.
Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world.
Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey.
Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention.
It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches.
Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there.
Odisha has a dignified historical background and has a very rich cultural tradition. People of the state are full of warmth.
This is a chance for the sports lovers to see Odisha.
I also convey my wishes to all the teams from around the world coming to participate in the tournament.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward and volunteering for social works is really inspirational and encouraging for all our countrymen.
One young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled, divyang players.
This spirit, this dedication is a mission mode activity.
Will this not make every Indian feel proud.
This spirit of We, not I will surely inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry.
He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic in Mann Ki Baat as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature.
How do we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for achieving sustainable development and learn from those traditions
Manishji, I appreciate you for bringing this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one subject that inspires us to look into our dignified past and our ancient traditions, Today, the whole world and specially the western countries are discussing about environment protection and are trying to find new ways to adopt a balanced life style.
Our country is also facing this problem.
Our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of Central India and specially those in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship Peepal and Arjun trees religiously.
The Bishnoi community in the desert land of Rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection.
Specially, in the context of serving trees, they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree.
Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh claim their relationship with tigers.
They even treat them like their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland as well, tigers are seen as the forest guardians.
People of Warli Community in Maharashtra consider tigers as their guests and for them the presence of tigers is a good omen indicating prosperity.
There is a belief among the Kol community in Central India that their fortune is directly connected with the tigers and they firmly believe that if the tigers do not get food, the villagers will have to face hunger .
The Gond tribes in Central Indai stop fishing in some parts of Kaithan river during the breeding season.
They consider this area as a fish reserve and they get plentiful of healthy fishes because of this belief of theirs.
Tribal communities make their dwelling units from natural material which are strong as well as eco-friendly.
In the isolated regions of the Nilgiri plateau in South India, a small wanderer community Toda make their settlements using locally available material only.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights.
There is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities.
Who can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda who struggled hard against the British Empire to save their own forest land.
Besides whatever I have said, there is a very long list of examples of the tribal communities which teach us how to keep a close coordination and make adjustments with the nature and the nation is indebted to our tribal people for the forest land that is still remaining with us.
Come on, let us express our gratitude towards them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra-ordinary contribution for the society.
These works may seem small but have a very deep impact in changing our thinking and in giving a new direction to the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about a farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab.
The son of this hard working farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was to be married.
Gurbachan Singh ji had told the brides parents that the marriage would be performed in a solemn manner.
But then he suddenly said that he had one condition.
And, when a condition is put these days, generally it is thought that the other side is going to make a big demand which will be really difficult for the brides family to fulfill.
But, you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he told the brides father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji asked him to promise that they will not burn parali or stubble in their fields.
You can well imagine the social strength this statement had.
This point made by Gurbachan Singh ji appears quite ordinary but this reveals how tall and strong his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who connect their individual matters with the benefit of the society as a whole.
Shriman Gurbachan Singh jis family has presented one such example before us.
I have also read about a village Kallar Majra which is near Nabha in Punjab.
Kallar Majra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process.
Congratulations to bhai Gurbachan Singh ji
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor.
Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment.
For India, 11th of November this year has a special significance because on 11th November a hundred years back the World War I had ended.
Ending of that war is completing one hundred years meaning thereby that a century of ending of the vast devastation and human loss would also get completed.
For India, World War I was an important event.
Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war.
Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war.
Our soldiers have displayed great valour in difficult areas and adverse conditions.
There has just been a single objective behind it- Restoration of peace.
The world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during the World War I
According to estimates, around one crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives.
This made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
My dear countrymen, our North-East has a unique distinction of its own.
The natural beauty of North East has no parallel and the people of this area are extremely talented.
Now our North-east is also known for all best deeds.
North east is one region that has made grand progress in organic farming.
A few days ago Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award, 2018 for encouraging the sustainable food system.
This award is given by the UN body Food Agriculture Organisation FAO.
You will be delighted to know that this best policy making award is equivalent to an Oscar in the sector.
Not only this, our Sikkim outperformed 51 nominated policies of 25 countries to win this award.
For this, I heartily compliment the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
uite a change is being felt in the weather.
Winter has set in and with the changing weather, the season of festivals has also set in - Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaiya Dooj, Chhatth in a way it can be said that the month of November is the month of festivals.
I extend my best wishes to all countrymen for these festivals.
I would request all of you to take best care of yourselves and take care of your health as well and also take care of social interests.
Your progress is a vital part of the countrys progress.
The more you progress, the more will the country progress.
