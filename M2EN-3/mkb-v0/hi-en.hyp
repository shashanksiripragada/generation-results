My dear countrymen, greetings
My best wishes to you all on Diwali.
We have been told - Shubhakroti Kalyanam Health Wealth Sampadam
In this verse, the best message is that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect, shows goodwill.
My bow to such a divine flame
To remember this Deepawali, what could be a better idea than to expand the light, spread the positivity and pray for the destruction of the spirit of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world .
The special thing is that this includes not only the Indian community but also the governments of many countries, the citizens of that country, the social organizations of that country celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way , India stands there .
Friends, In the world, festival tourism has its own attraction.
There are immense possibilities of festival tourism in our country.
Our endeavour should be to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu Ho and to involve people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
We have so many different festivals in every state and region that people of other countries are very interested in them.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different on this Diwali.
I had said that let us celebrate India's women power and achievements on this Diwali. That is, the honor of India's Lakshmi.
Immediately afterwards, there were innumerable inspiratory stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh of Larangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power
My mother is God for me
Everything is for me and she is truly the Lakshmi of India .
Ramesh ji, my salute to your mother
Geetika Swamy, who lives on Twitter, says that for him Major Khushboo Kanwar is the Laxmi of India who is the daughter of a bus conductor and led the All - Women contingent of Assam Riles.
For Kavita Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi is her daughter, who is also her strength.
They're proud that their daughter makes the best painting
He has also achieved a very good rank in the ATE examination .
At the same time Megha Jain ji has written that Ninety Two Year, an elderly woman of 92 years, has been providing free water to the passengers at the Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji is deeply motivated by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi of this India.
Many such stories have shared
You must read, take inspiration and share something similar to yourself. And I respectfully bow down to all the Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous poetess of the 17th century, Sanchi Honamma, he had written a poem in Kannada language in the 17th century, that word, that word, every Lakshmi of India, that is what we are talking about
It seems that its foundation was composed in the 17th century itself.
How excellent words, how wonderful feelings and how excellent ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Panida Parmegondu Himavantu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidanupanida Janakrayanu Jasuvalidnu (Penninda Permegondanu Chimavantanu. Penninda Broohu perchidanu Perchidanu) meaning Himavanta i.e. Himavanta i.e. Himavanta i.e. Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu due to her daughter Lakshmi and Raja Janak got fame due to her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and the glory of these daughters is a strong identity and a bright future for our society.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Dev ji ' s influence is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled who are fully devoted to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visits to the gurdwaras in Vancouver and Tehran
There is so much about Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but for this there will be many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that the work of selfless service cannot be valued .
They stood firmly against social evils like untouchability
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered his message in the world, far and wide
He was one of the most travelers in his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone, his simplicity, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji performed many important religious pilgrimages, called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they went everywhere, north or south, east or west, meet saints and sages
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He travelled to the holy land of Haridwar
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi. It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji stayed there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Visits Guru Nanak Dev ji to Sri Lanka in the South
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which also reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sad hour, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev ji also visited Tibet, where people considered him, Guru
They are also revered in Uzbekistan, where, they travelled,
During one of his sadness, he had also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of the Highness Live Countries of nearly 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these Ambassadors did not only see the Golden Temple but also got an opportunity to know about the Sikh traditions and culture.
After this, many Ambassadors wrote very gloriously good experiences of sharing their photos on Social Media.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of 31st October.
Sardar Patel used to examine the finest things in depth.
In fact, they were Man of Detail.
At the same time, he was also an expert in organization skills .
He mastered planning and formulating strategies
When we read and listen to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, we get to know how tremendous his planning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Nineteen Twenty One in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire arrangement of the session
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to delegates
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping them with you, the delegates have finished the tension of stealing shoes.
On the other hand , Khadi sales also increased considerably .
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did an important task of ensuring fundamental rights so that there is no scope for any discrimination based on caste and creed.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a great job of uniting the princely states and doing a great job.
Indeed, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in certain provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour looked at Lakshadweep and sent a ship with his flag.
As soon as Sardar Patel came to know of this, he wasted time without delay, immediately, initiated tough action.
Soon after his command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and after seeing every conspiracy of the neighbours to capture Lakshadweep , they demolished it .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
It's also an attractive tourist destination.
I hope all of you will travel to its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the day on which the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the tallest statue in the world .
America is double in height than the Statue of Liberty
The worlds tallest statue fills every Indian with pride
Every Indian ' s head rises higher than glory .
You will be pleased to see more than 26 lakh tourists in a year to visit the State of Unity.
This means that on an average, 8,500 people showed the grandeur of Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel demonstrated his faith and reverence in his heart and now the centres of attraction like Lactus Garden, Butterly Garden, Jungle Saari, Children Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery are continuously developing and this is also encouraging the local economy and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villages, in their homes, are providing the facility of Home Stay.
Professional training is also being given to those who provide home stay facilities.
The people there have started cultivating ragon ruits and I am sure it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there .
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for the country, for all the states and for tourism industry.
We all are witnesses to how a place within a year develops as a world famous tourism destination.
People from abroad come there
Several systems of transport, lodging, guides, eco-friendly systems and systems are developing automatically.
There is a huge economic development and people are creating facilities there as per the requirement of the passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country at all costs.
Run for Unity is being organized every time on October 31, like every time
It will include people from all sections of society
Run for Unity symbolizes this, this country is one running in one direction and wants to achieve one goal
One Target - Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat
The last five years have been observed not only in Delhi but also in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, in small tier-2-tier 3 cities, in such large numbers be it men or women or city people, people of villages, children, youth or elderly people or people with disabilities, everyone is joining in such large numbers.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a passion and passion for marathon.
Run for Unity is also such a unique provision
Running is beneficial for brain and body for everyone .
There is also a range of ITIs.
In addition to fulfilling the spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, we also join the purpose.
And that is why not only the body but also the mind and rituals to take India to new heights for the unity of India.
And so in whatever city you live in, there, you can know about the Run for Unity around you
In this portal, information has been given about those places across the country where Run for Unity is to be organised.
I hope that all of you will run on 31st October for the unity of India, for the fitness of yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country in the form of unity
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every stage, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in empowering the unity and mutual goodwill of the country.
If we look around, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to enhance mutual understanding, but sometimes it happens that the society's efforts, its contribution and memory disappears very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court ruled on the Ram Janmabhoomi
Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of the circumstances in their own way.
In order to create warmth in the atmosphere, what kind of language was spoken
But all these things, five days, seven days, ten days, were going on, however, just as the decision came, a pleasant and surprising change was felt by the country.
On one hand, everything was done for warmth for two weeks, but when the decision on Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, the political parties, the social organizations, the civil society, the representatives of all the communities, the saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day , my mind is happy .
The dignity of the judiciary was respected with utmost pride and nowhere did it create an atmosphere of warmth and tension.
These things should always be remembered , it gives us great strength .
That day, that moment, we all have a sense of duty.
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story of every household is heard far and wide, one story of every village is heard - from North to South, East to West, from every corner of India, it is a story of cleanliness.
But there is also a pleasant experience and interesting experience .
I hear, I think, I'll tell you, too.
Imagine, the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature goes to minus 50-60 degrees
Oygen in the air is also merely nominal .
In such a opposite situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is no less than a bravery.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the boundaries of the country by chanting cena but also running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express gratitude
There's so cold that it's hard to decompose anything
In such a scenario, separation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself.
In such a scenario, 130 tons of garbage was removed from the glacier and surrounding areas and that too is a great service between the ragile eco-system here.
We all know that Siachen is such a glacier which is a source of rivers and clean water . Therefore , running a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in lower areas .
as well as using water from rivers like Nubra and Shiok
My dear countrymen, festival is a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, specially, buying something new and bringing something from the market happens in every family in a small amount.
I once said that we should try - - buy local things
If we get what we need from our village then there is no need to go to tehsil .
If you meet in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
The more we strive to buy our local items, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I always urge that we should buy something from the hand of our weavers, from the hand of our Khadi people.
You might have bought a lot before Diwali but there are a lot of people who think that if they go after Diwali they might get a little cheaper.
So there ' s a lot of people who still have to buy it .
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come and be insistent on buying local items.
Look how important we can play in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Like in Diwali, we use firecrackers
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
gets injury somewhere
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Will he be able to control his own life and fate
Revered Bapu's Jantar can be remembered
Can we imagine at the time of shopping which citizen of my country will benefit from what I ' m buying
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is considered to be a symbol of the mutual love and trust of sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many such stories in the history of the country, in which a defense formula had linked people from two different states or religions to the door of faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also going to come
The entire atmosphere is about to echo, horse, palanquin, Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda's hymn.
The intuitive joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Rakshabandhan , Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in the preservation, riding and delivering this great heritage to the common man.
India takes pride in the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians take pride in the fact that from the Vedic times to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a major role in propagating knowledge.
Knowledge related to every sphere of life is stored in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technologies, agriculture or health, astronomy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for conversation.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are possible
They sometimes use Sher Shayari but those who are familiar with Sanskrit good wishes, they know that in very few words such a precise statement is made from Sanskrit good wishes and secondly it is very easy to understand because of their being associated with our soil and tradition.
Like in life it has been asked to explain the importance of Guru - Akshramastu, Guru: disciple Prabodhyayat
Let us celebrate Teachers Day with this spirit
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and congratulate you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
Trees and plants scorching with severe heat give relief to dry reservoirs but sometimes it also brings excessive rain and devastating floods
There is a situation of nature that in some places more rain has occurred than other places .
The severe floods in Kerala have severely affected the lives of people
Today in these difficult situations the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their loved ones, the damage done to their lives cannot be compensated, but I want to assure the bereaved families that 1. 25 billion Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
My prayers are that those who have been injured in this natural calamity, should be healthy as soon as possible.
I am sure that the people of the state will soon rise again by the strength and indomitable courage of the people of Kerala.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is a problem, whether it is in Kerala or in other districts of India or in the region, peoples lives can be normal again.
All Age Groups and people from all walks of life are contributing
Everyone has been trying to ensure that the sufferings of the people of Kerala can be minimized.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
They did not leave any stone unturned to save people trapped in the flood
I would also like to specifically mention the hard work of NCR junkies .
In this moment of crisis he has done a very good job .
The ability of NHRC to manage the situation by making its commitment and quick decision has become a new devotion centre for every Indian.
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give strength to the country and especially to Kerala so that they can recover from this calamity as soon as possible and give further momentum to the development journey of Kerala.
Once again, on behalf of all my countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and other parts of the country that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind .
The topic on which people from all over the country wrote the most is our beloved Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapn Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many innumerable people have written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and Mygov asking me to talk about various aspects of Atal jis life.
On 16th August, as soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise, everyone saddened
A nation leader who quit as Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the past 10 years , he had gone far from active politics .
We were not seen anywhere in the news, did not look publicly
For the past several days, the best aspect of Atal ji has emerged before the country.
People have remembered him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister and do it
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act Two Thousand Three
This change made two significant changes in India ' s politics
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats
Secondly, the limit fixed under anti-defection law was increased from one third to two-thirds
Further, clear guidelines were also laid down for disqualification of defectioners.
For many years the political culture of forming a massive cabinet in India was made not only for the sharing of the big Jumbo cabinet but also to please the politicians.
Atal ji changed it
His move saved money and resources
At the same time, efficiency increased.
It was a long visionary like Atal ji who changed the situation and developed healthy traditions in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in the time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 p . m . in the evening because at that time there was a time for parliament to be started in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 a.m.
Several rules have been made in this code, which has made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
This gave more and more Indians an opportunity to hoist their national flag
Thus he brought our favourite tricolor closer to the masses .
Likewise nowadays you are seeing that discussions are going on in the country about holding elections of the Center and the States simultaneously .
People in both sides and opposition are keeping their point of view
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy .
I would definitely say that for a healthy democracy, to develop good traditions for a better democracy, to constantly strive for strengthening democracy, to carry forward discussions openly, this would also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay tribute to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Monsoon session of Parliament ends just a few days ago
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
All MPs tried to make the monsoon session more and more useful by rising above the party and as a result Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and Rajya Sabha 14 bills
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as the Session of Social Justice and Youth Welfare
Several important Bills that benefit the youth and the backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades there has been a demand for creating a B Commission just like the SST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes this time the country has fulfilled its resolve to form the BCC and has given it a constitutional right
This step will prove to be a step forward for the cause of social justice .
Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed in this session .
This law will further protect the interests of SC  ST community .
At the same time it will prevent criminals from oppressing and will believe in Dalit communities
No civilized society can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country .
The country is not ready to bear the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has made provision for severe punishment.
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls below 12 years of age.
A few days ago you must have read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two minor rape convicts to death after just two months of hearing.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh sentenced the culprits to death after just five days of hearing
Rajasthan has also made similar decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crimes against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with full force to bring them justice .
When we move forward in the countryside, the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived can be changed.
This time in the monsoon session everyone has presented an ideal
These days the attention of millions of countrymen is on the Asian Games in Jakarta
Every morning people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won the medal
Asian games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to those sportspersons who are yet to compete.
Indias sportspersons, especially in Shooting and Restling, are performing excellently but our sportspersons are bringing medals in those games in which our previous performance has not been so good, such as sports like Hushu and Rowing are not just medals - there are proofs of Indian sports and sportspersons skyrocketing courages and dreams
Increased number of medal winners include our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even among the young sportspersons who win medals, our youth of 15-16 years are also present.
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I extend my warm greetings to all sports enthusiasts and pay my homage to the great sportsperson of Hockey, Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons a good performance.
Greetings to everyone on National Sports Day.
Hello Spirit, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen houses and buildings constructed with bricks and stones but can you imagine that about twelve-hundred-twelve years ago, a huge mountain, which was just a single-stone mountain, was given the shape of an excellent, large and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but it was a temple - the Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora in Maharashtra.
If anyone tells you that about a thousand years ago a 60 meter long pillar of granite was built and a rock of 80 tons of granite was placed on its summit - will you believe it
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible match of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
Land Engineering Laboratory of India
There have been many engineers in India who made the unimaginable imaginable and presented miracles in the world of engineering
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose work is still awesome to the people and he was Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
In that part of the country it is revered, the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In his memory , September 15 is made as Engineers Day .
The engineers of our country have made their mark all over the world following their footprints .
When I talk about the miracles of the world of engineering, I am reminded of the terrible earthquake that struck Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
At that time I used to work as a volunteer and I got the opportunity to visit a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother above 100 years of age and she was mocking at us and she was saying, Look, this is my house in Kutch.
But you didn ' t see any harm anywhere .
These houses were built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature of this place and he was saying this thing with so much pride. So I came to know that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created compositions according to the local conditions due to which the common man was safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at location
What new things do we have to learn in the changed era
The world is struggling with natural calamities
So what is the new form of structural engineering
What are his courses
What to teach students
How did this become our priority
We must think of many such things when English Day is celebrated.
Celebrations are the atmosphere and Diwali preparations are also started .
We will continue to talk about the minds of the people and we will continue to gather ourselves in furthering the country with our own minds.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all
Thank you
Will meet again
There are reports of good rainfall in many places these days .
Anxiety is also being reported somewhere due to excessive rainfall and in some places people are still waiting for rain.
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rains also display the form of choice and dislike, but what blame should we blame rain, it is man who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and consequently nature becomes ruthless to us.
And that is why we all have the responsibility to be the lover of nature, to be the protector of nature, to be the enricher of nature, to balance in what nature is.
In the past, a natural calamity has attracted the attention of the entire world, shocked the human mind.
All of you must have seen on television, a team of 12 teenage football players in Thailand and their cave to roam around.
They usually take a few hours to go into the cave and get out of it.
But luck that day was destined for it .
When they went deep inside the cave , a sudden heavy rain accumulated near the cave gate .
You can imagine how those moments will be when you face death in adolescent condition and you have to spend the moment
On the one hand, they were struggling with crisis, on the other hand humanity was united in the whole world expressing the divine human qualities.
People all over the world were praying to take these children out safely
Everyone, be it the government, the parents of these children, their family members, media or the citizens of the country, everyone showed a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in their mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a Thai Navy naval personnel lost their lives
The whole world is amazed at the fact that he did not give up his hopes with such bravery and patience in a dark cave filled with water in spite of such difficult situations .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are amazing things.
We just need to focus on our goal with a calm and steady mind, work for it.
In the past , the beloved poet of our country Neeraj ji left us and left us .
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, faith in himself
The months of July and August , however , are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
because this is the time when colleges have a peak season
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges
If you go to Feams, Papers, Hanswers in February and March then you can enjoy your holidays in April and May as well as results, decide the directions ahead in your life and career choices.
July is the month when young people step into a new phase of their life when they get away from occupations to cut-offs.
Students ' attention goes from home to hostel
Students come in the shadow of processors with the shadow of parents
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of their college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, going out of the village, coming out of a protective environment, we have to make ourselves a partner.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students would have joined their colleges so far, some would be joining.
I would like to tell you people that be calm, enjoy life, enjoy life in abundance.
There is no fodder without books, no study has to be done, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends is a very wise work in itself.
Learn something new, such as new skills, learn new languages
Youth who have left their homes and gone out to some other place, discover those places, know about them, people, language, culture and tourist destinations there.
My best wishes to all the youngsters starting a new innings.
His father picks up garbage and raises his family
I congratulate them for their success.
There are so many students who belong to a poor family and despite their hard work and perseverance, they have done something that inspires us all.
Betia Afreen Shaikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto rickshaw, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick kiln
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair or Anushka Panda, a disabled daughter of Gurgaon, who has been suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy since birth, all of them have achieved such success by crossing every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around , we ' ll find many such examples .
Neeraj ji has said, I want to narrate the song Akash to the earth, I want to call every darkness in the light. I have to head the sword with the smell of flowers. And I want to awaken the mountains of Ga-Ga.
The incident was that once the San Jose city of America, which is known as Technology Lub, I was discussing with Indian youth
I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India.
I had appealed to convert Brain-rain into Brain-Gain
Using his professional skills Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together have prepared a SmartGaon App.
These apps are not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile phones .
This village of Rae Bareli, the residents of Taudhakpur, the Gram Pradhan, District Magistrate, everyone made the people aware about the use of this App.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will come to mind that the young America, its lifestyle, its thinking and its lifestyle, its lifestyle, its lifestyle, its thinking, its left India many years ago but still knows the nuances of its village, its challenges and it is emotionally connected to the village.
For this reason, he may have made something exactly what the village wants.
Every Indian naturally feels that this association with his village, with his roots and that he has done something for the country .
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to ecology, a slight ash gets accumulated on it but even if a small spark gets touched then all the things come back and pull them towards their past days.
We should also examine the situation, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us, the ash has not solidified.
Santosh ji thank you very much for your Phone Hall
In fact Pandharpur Warri is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, who was on 23rd July this year, is also celebrated as the grand culmination of Pandharpur Warri.
Pandharpur is a holy city in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Almost 15-20 days before the Ashadhi Ekadashi, pilgrimages go out on foot to visit Pandharpur along with the guardians .
This journey, called Wari, includes millions of Varkari
Saints like Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram move towards Pandharpur by singing Vithal-Vithal singing, dancing and playing the footsteps of great saints, keeping them in the palanquin.
Pilgrims visit Lord Vithal , also called Vithova or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
People of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense reverence, devotion
Going to the Vithova temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy have a different experience .
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once they get the opportunity .
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are educating the common man even today in Maharashtra.
We are giving strength to fight against superstition and in every corner of India this saint tradition has been giving inspiration .
We get an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them whether they are frightened or disgusted .
Its mantra is to fight society with reverence against superstition
These were the people who from time to time stopped the society, showed a mirror and ensured that old evil practices were eliminated from our society and the people had compassion, equality and purity.
This is our Bharat-Bhoomi-Bhumi-Bhumi-Bhumi-Bhumi-Bhumi-Bhumi-Bhumi-Vasundhara. Just like a great tradition of saints was there in our country, in the same way the great men who dedicated their lives to the powerful mother-Bharati had sacrificed their lives.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember Tilak jis birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence .
They had the power and wisdom of the British rulers to show the mirror of their mistakes .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I would like to place an interesting incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and one of his statues in Ahmedabad before the countrymen today.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people welcomed him in Ahmedabad, about a hundred years ago and during his visit here Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 01, 1920, he had decided to build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and it was named after the ueen of Britain .
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb had inaugurated it not only from anyone else but also from Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929. It is a matter of great pleasure. In that inaugural address, revered Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got one person but has also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak ji.
And my dear countrymen, the uniqueness of this statue is that it is such a rare idol of Tilak in which he is sitting in a chair. In it, it is written just below Tilak. Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of British rule.
The tradition of Ganesh Utsav started with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji .
The public Ganesh Utsav had become an effective medium for traditional reverence and celebration as well as for furthering the spirit of social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
There was a time when the country was united to fight against the British, these festivals worked to unite everyone by breaking the barriers of caste and creed.
Over time, the population of these events has increased.
This shows that our young generation is still crawling towards our heroes of our ancient heritage and history.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh - Pandal in almost every street .
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn the qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop them within themselves.
And when I was reminding Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would urge you once again to celebrate Ganesh Utsav, celebrate Ganesh Utsav with great fanfare, celebrate Ganesh Utsav with great fervor but keep urging you to celebrate the Eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav.
And I would like that every city should have separate competitions like Deco Friendly Ganesh Festival and they should be rewarded. And I would like that on MyGov as well as on Narendra Modi App, the items of Deco-Friendly Ganesh Festival should be kept for wide publicity.
I will surely convey your word to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen, he slogan Swaraj is our birthright and we will continue to take it
Today is the time to say Swaraj is our birthright and we will take it
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development
I ' m talking about Chandrashekhar Azad
What will be the youth in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our heart, to see how much force is in Bazu-e-Katil These lines inspired many young people like Ashfaqullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azads passion for bravery and freedom, inspired many youngsters
Azad put his life on claim, but he never bowed to foreign rule
It was my good fortune that I had the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not even want to die from the bullets of foreigners - if he lives, fights for freedom and dies even then he will die after remaining free. This was his specialty.
Once again I bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji .
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has created history by winning the gold medal in the 400m race in the ongoing Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Winland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, in response to my letter, emailed me from Indonesia. Now she is preparing for the Asian Games there.
-Mail writes unity, The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I did it.
Ekta We all are also proud of you
You have illuminated the name of the country
Ekta won Gold and Bronze medals at World Para Athletics Grand Pri 2018 in Tunisia
His achievement is special because he made his challenge the medium of his success .
Daughter Ekta Bhayan in 2003, half of her body fails due to road accident, but this daughter did not lose courage and achieved this position by strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has won the gold medal in the Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin and won the gold medal in the world record. Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is full of several events and festivals, but sometimes due to the weather the disease also enters the house.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the motivation of patriotism, for the months of August and for the centuries-long festivals.
I ' ll meet you once again to talk about it .
Hello
My dear countrymen, once again I got the opportunity to be with you all in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
Just a few days ago there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore .
You must have understood that I am talking about the Test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match in Afghanistan was with India.
In this match, both the teams performed excellently and another baller from Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, was also present in the IFFI this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan , Mr . Ashraf Ghani tagged me on his twitter , the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan .
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan
He is the asset of the world of crickets and along with that he didn't write in a funny way. We're not going to give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us
Well this was the first match so it is very natural to remember but I will remember this match for a particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What did the Indian team do when they took the trophy
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team invited Afghanistan team, which was playing international matches for the first time, and the two teams took photos together
What happens to the sportsman spirit, what happens to the sportsmanship - from this one incident we can experience
There is an unprecedented way of unifying the sports society and discovering the skills and skills of our youth.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a separate sight on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world came together
Be it European Parliament or United Nations Headquarters in New York or Japanese Navy fighter vessels, people can see Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga took place and I was told that women had demonstrated several asanas.
Soldiers of India and China perform Yoga together on Ladakh High Snow Peaks
Yoga breaks all boundaries, connects
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a great festival by going beyond all kinds of distinctions of caste, religion, region, color or gender
If people from all over the world were participating in Yoga Day programmes with so much enthusiasm then why would it not be multiplied in India
Our Air Force warriors marveled at the height of 15 , 000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky .
The view was that he did swimming in the air, not sitting in the airplane.
Be it school, college, office, park, high building or playground, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has worked to unite people all over the world beyond caste, creed and geography. The feeling of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have lived for centuries
Our sages, sages, saints who always insist on Yoga have proved it to be true.
more and more people will make it a part of their lives
Many people on MyGov and NarendraModiApp have written to me that I should talk about this time's mind about the coming Doctors Day on July 1 - the right thing
We are those people who worship Mother in the form of God, consider her equal to God because Mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, so many times the doctor gives us rebirth.
Doctor ' s role is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today the doctor has not only medical expertise but also has a deep experience of the impact he has on our health and general life style trends.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills .
Our doctor is known for solving complementary medical problems along with the mastery in medical procession.
We are fortunate people born in this land of India
India has a rich history when there is no such month, there is no day in which no historical event has occurred.
See , everywhere in India has its own legacy
There is a saint, a great man, a famous person, everybody has his or her own contribution.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, Kabirwad of Gujarat is very well aware of it.
When I used to work there, I had also organized a national convention of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabir Das ji had gone to Maghar
At that time there was a perception that one who died in Maghar did not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered unclean but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
They broke the evils and superstitions of their time and so they went to Maghar and that is why they took Samadhi .
Sant Kabir Das emphasised on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his friends and couplets.
That was his ideal
We see the same ideal in his writings and in today ' s era he is equally inspiring .
That means true Pir saint is the one who knows and understands the suffering of others, who do not know the sorrow of others, they are brutal
Kabir Das Ji had laid special emphasis on social harmony .
They thought far beyond their time .
Put it in the temper, be merciful to all the coal
Kabir writes in another couplet - where mercy is tahan religion, where greed is sin
He said: - Do not ask caste, sadhu, ask knowledge
This is the greatness of the Guru and such a Guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who have shown goodwill to millions of people, keep inspiring for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
Wherever they went , they took several initiatives for the betterment of society .
Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system where every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to connect with enthusiasm and excitement
I urge you people to observe the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji throughout the society and across the world, what are the new ideas, what are new suggestions, what are new imaginations, we should think and prepare ourselves for it with great pride.
My dear countrymen
The struggle for India's independence is very long, very broad, deep and full of countless martyrdoms.
There is another history associated with Punjab
Celebrating 100 years of the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which embarrassed the entire humanity
How can we remember the 100 years of this event, how can we all think about it, however, the immortal message that this incident has given us, we must always remember that this violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi, has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, there is a birthday of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this programme.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was good to see your interest in the history of India .
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23,
Very few people would know that on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937 Sri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had addressed the convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali language .
This was the first time when the British ruled and somebody at the University of Kolkata addressed the convocation in Bengali language.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense, he laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development, laid a strong base and prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field
He wanted India to develop big industries and also pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
He was quite passionate about the development of West Bengal .
The result of their understanding, wisdom and activism is that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India .
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was India's integrity and unity. And for this, he lost his life at the age of 52.
Let us always remember the message of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's unity, with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood, be alive for India's progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video call.
I got the opportunity to learn directly from them about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people beyond the files.
People told about their resolutions, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements.
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me but it was a different kind of learning experience. And what could be a moment of greater satisfaction than the joy that was on the faces of people during this period
When he heard the stories of an ordinary human being, his naive words touched the heart, what he was telling the story of his experience.
Betiyas in remote villages are providing services ranging from the pension of the elderly to the construction of passports through Common Service Centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh elects Sitafal and makes her business by constructing an office-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of youth of the country are running medicine centers as well as going to nearby villages and providing affordable medicines.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two-three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, ten or fifteen people are also giving more jobs
Here, students of schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working at an impartial topic like waste management at school tinkering lab at their young age.
There would not be any corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success.
In such an environment when the common man comes with a new hope, a new excitement and talk of events happening in his life, then he is not credited with the government.
The incident of a small girl from a small village far and wide also becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians .
A moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge with the help of technology has been extremely pleasant and inspiring for me. It gives me satisfaction to work but it also gives me more enthusiasm to do more work.
The poorest of the poor gets another new joy of living, another new enthusiasm, another new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge programme and you gave me new energy.
I would like to once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere it is good.
Those who do good are a people who do good .
We can also feel the aroma of goodness .
I noticed one thing in the past and this is a very unique combination
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters engaged in farming and farming.
He came along with the technicians and formed a Sahaj Samridhi Trust and activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
They joined the farmers, made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand efforts are being made to ensure their right to farmers participation in profits.
A separate seed bank has been created for the good crop, good breed seeds for it.
Women see the functioning of this seed bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment. And I am glad that these youngsters from the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their grip to join the farmer, join the village, join the farm and join the barn.
I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments which I may have to go for something, some people may not know anything, some people may not know anything.
GST is going to be completed in one year, it was the dream of the people of the country, it has transformed into reality today.
One Nation One Tax Reform, if I want to give credit to most of the states then I will give credit to the states.
An excellent example of GST Cooperation Federalism is that where all the states together took decisions in the countryside and after that such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that people of different political ideologies sit there, people of different states, state governments with different priorities but despite all the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been unanimously taken.
Before GST, there used to be 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is applicable across the country in this system.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of honesty
In the past , there used to be complaints from Inspector Raj in the case of tax .
From return to reund everything happens through online information technology
With the introduction of GST, check post was finished and the movement of goods increased, which not only saved time but also benefitted the logistics sector.
GST may be the world's largest tax reform
Such a massive tax reform was successful in India because the people of the country adopted it and only through the peoples power could the success of GST be ensured.
It is generally believed that such a large country, such a large population, it takes 5 to 7 years for it to be completely stable. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the honesty of the country is the result of the participation of the people. This new tax system has made its place within a year and it has achieved stability and it also improves with its inbuilt arrangements as per the requirement.
Once again you have got the opportunity to be the most familiar with the mindset .
You will remember very well the six women commanders of the navy, one of these teams was on a sea journey for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - I want to talk about them
These six daughters of India, this team of theirs, have provided more than 250 days of service to the nation through sea.
NS Tarini has returned to India on May 21 after traveling all over the world and the whole country warmly welcomed him
He travelled about twenty two thousand natural miles in different oceans and many seas .
It was the first event in the world itself .
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, Navy's prestige, for enhancing India's dignity and especially to the world that India's daughters are not less.
Who does not know Sense of Adventure
If we look at the development journey of mankind then some adventure has developed in the womb itself.
Development takes birth only in the lap of adventure
I can do something about the intention of doing something different from some leaks and doing something extraordinary. However, for ages, there are inspirations for several people.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from an ashram-school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra climbed the highest peak in the world by a group of tribal children like Tribal Students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam.
These students of Ashram-School started training in August 2017, Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh were trained.
These youngsters were selected under Mission Shaurya and they have made the entire country proud by conquering Verest according to their names.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the school of Chandrapur, to my young friends and friends.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to conquer Verest from Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first Indian father-daughter to climb Diya Verest
Not only that youngsters are the only ones climbing the Verest
Sangeeta Bahl climbed Verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 years old .
This work is not only commendable but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
Over the years, people have been climbing Verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these bravehearts, especially to their daughters.
And so a huge number of people from every region will come forward in its support .
When I talk about it India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
On social media, people are sharing videos of fitness challenge, tagging each other and challing them.
Many times you have heard from me about sports and sportspersons. And the last time our heroes of Commonwealth Games, their thoughts, their thoughts and programmes were telling us - Namaskar Sir.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the sports that were once a part of every child's life are becoming lesser today.
These games were special part of summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that at different places they were known by different names, such as Pittu, now this game is known by many names.
Nobody knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, seven stones, Dikori, Satodia, of the same game
There are two types of games in traditional games .
There are out doors too, indoor too
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names, different places.
I am from Gujarat. I know there is a game in Gujarat called Chomal-Isto.
They are played with wheels or tamarind seeds or dice and with 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state .
We too used to play these games .
Which of us will be, who has not played gilli-danda in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played from village to city
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi, in Maharashtra it is called Financial
Some games have their own season .
You must have seen many children, who are shy, but become very cheerful when playing
Grandmothers and grandparents from children, whenever they play, they dont say that or generation gap, that too gets touched.
At the same time, we know our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about society, environment etc .
Through crowd sourcing we can create a huge archive of our traditional sports
Videos of these games can be created, which can be shown about the rules of sports, how to play
India will officially host World Environment Day on 5th June
This is a very important achievement for India and it is also recognising Indias growing leadership in the world towards mitigating climate change .
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, to understand the importance of this theme, to make sure that we do not use the policy, low grade plastic and to reduce the negative impact of plastic policy on our nature, on our wildlife and on our health.
Visit World Environment Day Website Weed-India2018 and there are a lot of suggestions given in a very interesting manner. See, Learn and try to bring them into your everyday life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that there was dust in different parts of the country, along with strong winds, heavy rains, which is unseasonal.
There was also loss of life, goods and losses
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout his life .
When India played a leading role in the Op21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the world through the International Solar Alliance, all of them had an essence of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what we can do to make our planet clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You remember the same June 21, not only you, but the whole world remembers June 21.
21st June is observed as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people begin preparations months ago
These days news is getting, preparations are going on all over the world to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21.
Centuries ago, this saying means that after doing regular yoga, some good qualities become like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage that always protects us like a father
A feeling of forgiveness arises as a mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our lasting friend .
Bhartruhari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy, our sister, self-restraint, our brother, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge our hunger is eradicated.
When so many qualities become companions of someone , the yogi conquers all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all my countrymen to carry forward their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today 27th May is the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Panditji
The memory of this month of May is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers stood up against injustice while showing their bravery
Unfortunately , for a very long time , the events of 1857 were only called rebellion or soldiers rebellion .
In fact , that incident was not only undermined but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month when the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji ' s personality was full of characteristics
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our dear respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji .
How accurate was the depiction of Atal ji
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a bold revolutionary
I was watching a story on TV about our poor daughters of raw settlements in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were once compelled to take garbage from house to house, are learning the sewing work today and sewing clothes to cover the poor.
The daughters here are stitching from normal to good clothes in addition to their own and their family clothes today.
They are also coursing skill development along with it
Our daughters are self-reliant today, living their lives with dignity and have become a force for their families.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters of hope and trust for their bright future.
They have shown that if there is a desire to do something and you are determined to do it then success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties. And it is not just a matter of Sikar that you will get to see all this in every corner of the country.
If you look close to yourself, you will realise how people defeat problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop and enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people.
These discussions are political, social, film, sports, sports and sportspersons as well as on the problems faced by the country - such a problem should be solved. However, these things often remain confined to discussion but some people are those who move forward in the direction of bringing about a change with their work, their hard work and passion.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, had some similar story of his own dreams and self-exploration for fulfilling them.
Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting D. Prakash Rao.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They provide education, health and food to all children attending school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, dedication and a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have ended the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the whole country.
Let us take positivity forward .
In the month of June there is so much heat that people wait for rain and in this hope they look at the clouds in the sky .
A few days from now, people will also wait for the moon
Moon appearance means that Eid can be celebrated .
After one month of fasting during Ramadan the festival of Eid symbolizes the beginning of celebration .
I am confident that everyone will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm. Children will especially get good Idi on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society .
Greetings to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all
Then you will meet again next month in mind
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018

And I am glad that people are joining it with great zeal. Many people have written to me showing their support for it, letters have been sent to me, it is India Stories too. A gentleman, Mr. Shashikant Bhosle has shared a picture of his swimming policy - My Weapon is my body, my element is water, My World is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes : From the morning walk I feel happy and healthy and she further says - " For me fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience, my dear countrymen
When we hear that there are going to be wars on water in the world in the future , everybody speaks about it , but is it our responsibility
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
That is, he has the responsibility of distributing it with the seekers, I do not know Bengali language. But when I was young, I was used to getting up very early - radio starts early in childhood and in eastern India, when it starts late in West India then I have a fat idea in the morning.
Rabindra Music started at 30 o'clock, Rabindra Music started on radio and I didn't know the language. I got used to getting up early in the morning to listen to Rabindra Music on the radio. And when I got the opportunity to listen these poems Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmoni, you got a lot of consciousness. You too, Rabindra Music, his poems must have influenced me. I respectfully pay tribute to Rabindra Nath Tagore.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We must be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcased the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of Lord Buddhas obligation to strive, pledge and walk on his path.
Ambedkar insists that his social philosophy has been a great inspiration for Lord Buddha. He said My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavami
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
In the life of revered Bapu, we have seen the power of Ram every moment in his life.
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries from the ASEAN countries were present here, they had come here with a cultural troop. And it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting the Ramayana before us.
That is, Ramayana and Ramayana are creating inspiration and influence not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time I have received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
Soft Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting on-line courses in Sanskrit.
It was very nice to see your love for Sanskrit as well as being a TV professional.
I have asked the concerned department to communicate to you about the efforts being made in this direction .
I would also request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit to consider how to carry forward the suggestion of Komal ji.
Mr. Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barkar, District Nalanda, Bihar - read the comments written on your NarendraModiApp
The concern you have expressed on the declining water level in the ground is definitely very important
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds during summers .
Shakal ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that this time I will talk to the youth about his health.
They think compare Asian counterries so our young people are physically weak
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail - it will be a big challenge.
In the past, the President of France visited Kashi. His Excellency Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that journey were going to touch the heart, they were going to create an impact.
And, he had requested that all those photos should be published on all video, social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared those photos on social media and NarendraModiApp that day.
Anghah, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that your letters make me feel tired all day long.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, whatever I have heard and there are a lot of things that touched my mind.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about exam
Holidays have their plan, shared
Worried about the water of animals and birds in the summer
Farmer brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities related to farming and farming across the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation
In the festival of festivals, our culture and our traditions there are things that come about.
That is, the things of mind change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our mind change the weather in someone's life.
And why not change
It has the power to change the weather of the whole country .
13 years ago, the sister of Kolkata's Lab-driver Saidul Laskar died due to lack of treatment - she decided to build a hospital so that no poor person died due to lack of treatment.
Saidul sold household ornaments in his mission and collected money through donations
And today due to his hard work and determination, due to his determination and hard work, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such motivations introduce my country
Today, this belief has awakened in every section of the country, among the youth, among women, among the backward, among the poor, among the middle class.
We can move forward, our country can move forward
A positive atmosphere of confidence filled with hopes and hopes
This self-confidence, this positivity, this resolution of New India will be realized, it will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common man's life.
What was Mahatma Gandhi's attachment to soil, fields and farmers, this expression is reflected in his line when he had said - To orgate how to dig the earth and to tend the soil, is to orgate sources. That is, if we forget to take care of the soil, it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji often stressed on the need for conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and better agro-structuring.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness for better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and ensuring all of them and enhancing food and milk production.
This low area state has done a great job .
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record during 2015-16 as compared to last five years.
They have shown that when the goal is set, when the courage is high and if there is a resolution in the mind then it can be achieved and shown.
In the letters that have come to me, I was seeing that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide fair price for the crops to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the village, Holisale Market and the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go too far to sell their produce - for this 22 thousand rural haats of the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platform while upgrading the necessary infrastructure.
That is, in a way, such a system is being created with the help of any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year will mark the start of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our resolve. Besides, 1. 25 billion Indians can pay the best tribute to Gandhi Ji by joining hands and shoulders.
You all urge me to share your thoughts with everyone on this through MyGov
What is Gandhi 150's logo
What is slogan or mantra or Ghosh-verse
Please give your suggestions on this .
Together we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him and take our country to new heights.
Thank you. Thank you, you have said the truth and I believe that Clean India and healthy India are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead with conventional approach in the field of health.
At the same time, all the departments and ministries, be it the Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers or Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on preventive health as well as affordable health.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and the easiest
And the more we are aware of preventive healthcare, the more the individual, the family and the society will benefit.
Cleanliness is the first need for life to be healthy
As a preventive health care, Yoga has renewed its identity throughout the world.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness
It is the result of all of us that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
International Day of Yoga 21st June - there are less than 100 days left between this time
On the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and around the world participated with great enthusiasm.
This time also we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, everyone for Yoga just now.
My dear countrymen, I am not Yoga Teacher
I will share this video with you all so that we can practice asanas, pranayama together.
Widespread efforts are also being made to ensure that people are able to affordable and healthcare accessible to the common man.
Today more than 3 thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened in the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at low prices .
More new centers are being opened
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to inform the needy about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras - their expense of many medicines will be reduced.
will be a great service to them
Price of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.

It's a great job
You need help in spreading awareness to people
We must collectively strive to get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had spoken of industrialization of India.
For them the industry was an effective medium in which employment could be provided to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the largest foreign direct investment in the world.
The entire world is looking at India as a FB for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible only in the cities due to which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization and urbanization of India.
Moving ahead with his vision, today Smart Cities Mission and Urban Mission have been started in the country to provide all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country be it good roads or water supply or be it education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb's self-reliance, firm belief in self-reliance
They didn ' t want anyone to live their lives in poverty .
At the same time he believed that the poor cannot be removed by just distributing something to the poor .
India, Stand Up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
During the 1930s and 1940s when there was only talk of roads and railways in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways.
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw Jal Shakti as a nation power.
Today, historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country
New ports are being built at different sea coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions were about the 2nd World War, the Emerging World War and the Partition. At that time, Dr.
laid the foundation of India's spirit
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, in every aspect of governance, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competive cooperative federalism. And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me belonging to the backward classes.
They have shown us that to move forward, it is not necessary that big or rich families are born, but those born in poor families in India can also dream, try to fulfil those dreams and succeed.
Yes, it happened when many people made fun of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan being organised from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar
Under this, there will be separate programmes on village development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, several festivals are going to come in the next few days - Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira is the day to remember his sacrifice and penance .
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence will inspire us all.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of Easter comes, Lord Jesus recalls the inspirational teachings of Christ who has always conveyed to humanity the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
In April, when Vaisakhi festival will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in those days, Joshit and Satwain in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila in West Bengal will be the joy and joy of Vaisakh.
All these festivals are connected in some form or the other with our farms and feeders. Through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts we receive in the form of yields.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Today in the beginning you start talking about mind with a phone call only .
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water .
Have we ever wondered why the river, the sea, why the water becomes colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk of science, first of all, the name of Indo-Ratna Sir C. V.
One of his discoveries is famous by the name of Raman Weect .
We celebrate the National Science Day on February 28 every year as it is said that on this day he had chosen a flight scattering incident for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other hand Sushruta and Charaka are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India
Lamous particle boson was also named after Satyendra Nath Bose .
It was interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
Nowadays machines are made more smart by self learning .
Can you help farmers with crop yields
In the past, along with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad, for the inauguration of the ICFRET.
Science and technology are value neutral.
The values are not automatically
Any machine will act as we wish .
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison , who invented Wight Bulb , failed many times in his experiments .
Once asked about it, he replied, "I have discovered ten thousand ways not to create a Wight Bulb, that is, Dison has also made its failures its own.
It is a coincidence that today I am in Auroville , the workplace of Maharshi Arabindo .
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, he questioned every aspect of life, as a great sage
Answer discovered and guided humanity
The spirit of asking questions repeatedly to know the truth is important.
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific discovery .
One should not sit comfortably until questions like why, what and how can not be answered
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of Crisis, a lot of messages have been sent to me on all these topics like safety and disaster.
From Pune, Mr. Ravindra Singh has spoken about the occupational security in his comment on the NarendraModi Mobile App.
He has written that safety standards on factories and construction sites are not as good in our country.
India's National Safety Day is on the next 4th of March, the Prime Minister should talk about the safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme so that people are aware of security.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, we are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
We all read the boards written on the roads several times and it says: 'Vigilance has decreased. One mistake, loss, cheerfulness and smile, do not leave the world so quickly, do not add to the security - do not do any kind of fun, otherwise life will be cheaper and these sentences never have any use in our lives.
If we remain cautious and follow the required rules then we can save our lives, but we can save our society from major accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of formulas have been written about the safety on the work place but when we look at it we don't see it anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents
An initiative named Disaster Mitra has also been taken to train volunteers in floods and cyclone risk districts.
Training and awareness play a very important role .
Two or three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year from Lu heat wave.
NMA then organised workshops for managing heat waves, campaigns to create awareness among people
Everyone's participation resulted in a good result
Number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 declined unexpectedly to around 220
This shows that if we prefer security, we can get security
I want to appreciate the number of people working in this manner, be it social organizations or be it aware citizens. I want to appreciate all those who are engaged in relief and rescue work within minutes of disasters.
And the number of such anonymous herroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about protecting values, safety of values, but we have to understand the values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our life .
I mean , what was the arrangement for providing information
Why
Because we are not consciious in nature and therefore our ears listen after sitting in airplane but no one of us feels that this information is for me.
Likewise , we have experience in every sphere of life .
We should not think that safety is for anyone else, if we all become aware of our security then the feeling of society's security is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, emphasis has been laid on making the villages waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas.
The initiative was initiated and named GBAR-Chan - Galvaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Chan scheme is to clean the villages and convert solid waste materials of cattle dung and fields into MPST and BI-GAS and generate wealth and energy from them.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other organic waste to produce energy but its full potential was not being utilized in India .
We are moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen
The goal of using cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, to make all these biogas based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged in rural India to see dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal Husbandry will improve and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in terms of energy for cooking and lighting
Help farmers and Animal Husbandry
Opportunities for new jobs for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
An online trade platform will also be created for smooth management of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers to the buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to be a partner in this movement of clean energy and green jobs. Take the initiative to convert waste into wealth in your village and make dung-filled dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been hearing about several types of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.
But the first Garbage Festival of the State was organized in a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh .
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and create awareness about various ways of re-use of garbage.
A variety of activities took place during this festival, from students to adults, everyone joined.
Different types of artifacts were created using garbage
Workshops organized to educate people on all aspects of East Management
Inspired by Raipur, there were different types of garbage festivals in other districts too.
Everyone took the initiative on their own, innovative ideas, shared discussions and poetry.
A festive atmosphere was ready for cleanliness
The way schoolchildren especially took part in it was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of the entire Chhattisgarh for the innovative way in which the importance of waste management and cleanliness was displayed in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated every year on 8th March
There are many programmes in the country and the world .
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country also felicitates women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda
He had said that the idea of the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - 100 years ago this thought of Swami ji reflects the contemplation of women power in Indian culture.
It is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life. It is our responsibility.
We are part of that tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son.
He has not only advanced himself but has also worked to take the country and society forward and take it to a new level.
In the past , a great suggestion was given to me by a great masalaya .
He had suggested that there are programmes like observing Women's Day on March 8 in every village and city which have completed 100 years.
Can there be a program of respect for such mothers and sisters and can there be talk of a long life in them
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal Sahiya, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big the event is
These women from Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is a powerful force of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that will transform the cleanliness drive in normal life and cleanliness rituals into a habit of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and the people there are so much joy and enthusiasm about it.
You all know very well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai in the sea.
I was surprised to know that despite being near Mumbai and having such a huge centre of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sant Bandar, the dark shadow that had been there in the lives of the people of the island, is now dark and their life is illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am glad that the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be illuminated by electricity.
It's not just electricity, but a new beginning in the era of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness that brings happiness to the lives of the countrymen
My dear brothers and sisters, just now we have celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March is the beauty of the fields decorated with luxurious crops, the golden ballads of wheat and the mangoes that thrill the mind - this is the specialty of this month
But this month is also very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
Holika combustion is as important as Holi is as the day of burning the evils in the fire and destroying them .
Holi is an auspicious occasion to forget all minds and hearts and join together, participate in each other's happiness and joys and gives a message of unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all the countrymen for the Holi festival.
May this festival be filled with colorful joy in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch the subjects written in his letter.
He has written, Kalpana Chawla's date to go to space on February 1.
He left us in the Columbia spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youth worldwide .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji for starting with the farewell of Kalpana Chawla in his long letter.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, particularly India, that there is no limit to women power.
Nothing is impossible if there is a desire and a determination to do something.
It is heartening to see that in India today women are moving fast in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, their place in society and their contribution has been wonderful to the whole world.
Indian scientists have a long tradition .
Many scholars of India have contributed to the shaping of the Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know many names
This reflects the importance of women in our society .
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, the unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples
He has written that our bold defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft will fly in Sukhoi 30, inspire them.
Three brave women are sentimental Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi Highter Pilots and are training at Sukhoi-30
Capacity All Women Rue, led by Vajpayee, has brought Air India from Delhi to San Francisco and back to Delhi.
Flighted in India Boeing Jet - and all the ladies
Recently Honble President took a new initiative
President of India calls on a group of exceptional women who have done something in their respective fields first
These women achievers of the country, first woman woman Train River of the first woman passenger train, first woman Bus River, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, thus the first woman to reach the Everest. Our women-powered men and women have made extraordinary achievements by breaking the conservativeness of the society and establishing a record.
He showed that a new path can be created by overcoming all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, perseverance and determination.
A book on these women achievers and first ladies has also been prepared so that the whole country can take inspiration from these women powers, their lives and their work.
It is also available as e-book on NarendraModi website
Today, the country's women power has an important role in the positive change in the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you might be wondering what connectivity is in the meantime.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India where all women employees are there .
Women staff in all departments be it the Commercial Department or the Railway Police, Ticket Hacking, Announcing, Point Person or the stake of more than 40 women
This time many people wrote on Twitter after watching the Republic Day Parade and on the other Social Media that the parade was one of the main features of the parade, the BSF Biker Contingent in which all women were participating.
They were using brave experiments and these scenes were also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women power is leading
is becoming self-reliant
When the mention of tribal women comes, a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, which contains forests, footpaths, women carrying the burden of wood on their heads
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running Rickshaws in such dangerous areas.
In a very short span of time many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Accepting the correction of the time-out, which is necessary
Any life-society is identified by its self-reacting mechanism
Over the centuries against social evils and social evils , there have been persistent efforts at the individual and social levels in our country .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
Human Chain, the worlds longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers to eradicate social evils in the state
Through this campaign, people were made aware against evils like child marriage and dowry practices.
The whole state has taken a pledge to fight with virtues like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youth, mothers, sisters, everyone was involved in this war.
The human chain commencing from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna has been unbreakable to the borders of the state.
It is necessary that all the people of the society get the benefits of development in the true sense that our society is free from these evils .
Let us all take a pledge to eradicate such evils from the society and to create a New India.
Build a strong and capable India
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration and everyone involved in the human chain for taking such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines used to be Rs.
He was not aware of the first Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there their cost of medicines reduced by 75 percent .
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat program so that more and more people get its information and they can take advantage of it .
For the past few years many people used to write to me on this subject, keep telling me
Get a deep satisfaction
And I was also very pleased to know that Shriman Darshan ji had received this idea that he should meet others as well.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care affordable and encourage ease of living .
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than the branded medicines sold in the market .
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens taking medicines everyday, to a great extent.
It contains generic medicines that are bought according to the standard of World Health Organization .
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
Not only are these medicines getting affordable but new employment opportunities are also being created for Individual Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at nectar stores of PMBJP Kendras and hospitals
The only objective behind all this is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra has made a photo share on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That Photo was such that my attention was drawn to that photo.
The photo was such that a grandson was participating in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morna river flowed for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal .
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, water bodies.
A lot of garbage was being thrown at the river and its banks .
An action plan was prepared and on January 13, one day before Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morna, at fourteen locations in the area of four kilometres, both edges of Morana river were cleaned.
More than six thousand Akola citizens, more than 100 NGOs, colleagues, students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this noble work of Mission Clean Mornah.
On 20th January 2018, this cleanliness drive was continued in the same way and I am told that till the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that there is nothing impossible if a person decides to do .
Major changes can be brought about through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and municipal administration for making this work a mass movement. I congratulate all the citizens of Akola and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the Padma Awards these days.
Even in the newspapers, it attracts attention on television.
There has been a tradition of awarding the Padma Awards every year but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has arrived due to the entire process being online
In a way the selection process of these awards has been fully transformed .
Padma awards have been given to such people who are usually not seen in big cities, newspapers, TV, festivals.
Now the significance of his work is not increasing, the identity of the person is not being given to him.
You must have heard that Mr. Arvind Gupta ji would be happy to know you.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life making toys for children
They have been making toys from waste for four decades to increase the curiosity of science in children .
His effort is to motivate children from useless things towards scientific experiments, so that they go to three thousand schools across the country and inspire children by showing films made in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
Similar story is Sitava Jodti (SI) of Karnataka.
They have not been called the goddess of women-empowerment.
For the last three decades in Belagavi they have made great contributions in changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself to Devadasi at the age of seven but then spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis .
Not only this, they have also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for his life but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but in the whole world.
Bhajju Shyam ji, who illuminated the name of India abroad, was recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award.
You will be filled with pleasant surprise by listening to the story of Laxmikutty, the tribal woman of Kerala.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests .
He made five hundred herbal medicines based on his memory
They have mastered making medicines used after snake bites
Lakshmi ji is constantly serving the society with herbal medicines
He was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to society by recognizing this anonymity.
Today, I would like to mention another name that 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital
When she was 23 years old, her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard-worked hospital.
I am confident that our Bahuratna-Vasundhara has so many male and female gems, whom no one knows, no one recognizes.
The Padma awards are a medium but I would like to tell the countrymen that there are millions and millions of people who have worked for the society around us, who have been living for the society, who have spent their lives for the society, who have spent their lives for the welfare of the society, who have worked for some specialty and who have worked for the rest of their lives.
They don't work for honor, but their work inspires us.
Sometimes such people in schools, colleges should listen to their experiences by calling them
Beyond the award, there should be some effort in society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
This is January 9, when the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate unbreakable bonds between India and Indians living all over the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a program where all Indian-origin MPs and Mayors from across the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme, from Malaysia, New Dealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Diji, Tania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, from many other countries where our mayor is original Indian, where MPs are from, originally, Indian origin, all of them participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries but also maintaining strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union has sent me the calendar in which they have shown their contribution to different regions by the Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Somebody is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody drowns the society's mind with his music and somebody immersed in his poems.
Somebody is researching climate change, somebody is working on Indian texts. Somebody has built a gurudwara by driving a truck and somebody has built a mosque.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for providing information to people around the world through them.
30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path.
On that day we celebrate Martyrs Day, we pay our homage to the great martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the country at 11 o'clock
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a family or a social revered Bapu, the ideals and ideals that revered Bapu had told us are still extremely relevant.
They weren't just blank theories
At present, we also look at the dagger-dagger how correct Bapu's words were
If we resolve to follow Bapu's path as much as we can, what can be a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by wishing you all the best in 2018.
Where the youth of 18 to 25 years of age should sit together and churn on New India, find ways and make plans
How can we realise our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
B.
a.
I talked to them, there was no sign of despair, there was enthusiasm, zeal, energy, dreams, resolutions, those daughters, I have got inspiration and these are the strengths of the country, these are the youth of my country. My dear countrymen, whenever there are discussions about the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural for me to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world-famous temple.
And especially in that place which is situated between hills and forests, how can this problem be converted into a sacrament, how can we find a way to get rid of the problem and what is the strength in public participation - this is an example of Sabarimala temple in itself.
Who would have made such rules
There will hardly be any citizen of India who does not respect them or who does not respect them.
They are very older than all of us and they are witnesses to different phases of the country.
She's 90 years old on September 28.
Before I went on a trip abroad, I had the privilege to talk to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, like, in a very dilapidated manner, the younger brother speaks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I thought of Hilata ji: Ha Hamodi ji: Many good wishes to you on your birthday, give advance congratulations
Lata ji: There are many people bigger than the age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Lata ji: Yes, I think it is the blessings of my parents, and the blessings of the listeners.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is your humility, this is a great education for all of us, this is a great education for the new generation. It is inspiring for us that you have always given priority to the values and humility of your parents even after learning so much in your life.
Lata ji: ji
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, G. Modi ji: You fed me some or some Gujarati
Lata ji: Yes, you don't know what you are
I know that the image of India is changing due to your arrival and that is what I am very happy.
It sounds very good
Modi ji: Just be sister, your blessings remain, your blessings remain on the whole country and people like us continue to do something good, you have always inspired me.
Your letter keeps on getting to me and I also get some of your gifts and goodwill so I have a special pleasure in this one-family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble, because, I see, I know, how busy you are and how much work you do.
What to think
When you came to touch your mother's feet, I also sent someone to her and took her blessings.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And she blessed me on the telephone, so I liked Modi ji: Our mother was very happy, because of your love.
And once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, I used to think that Rubra ji: ji, yes, yes.
Lata ji: yes, sure, definitely
This is my good fortune ,
Modi ji: Pranam, sister
Lata ji: Salute
Modi ji: Very good wishes to you ji: Very salute
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Festivals will be enchanted across the country for several weeks ahead.
All the best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
In the festivals, everyone from the family will come together.
Perhaps, these proverbs are not just words, we have an order, an order, a philosophy, an inspiration
Just imagine, on one side, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, in front of them, in the houses of some people around them, there is darkness.
In some households, sweets are getting worse, in some houses, children crav for sweets.
The real pleasure of these festivals is only when this dark sixth, this darkness is less - the light spreads.
We share happiness there too, where, lack, and, this is our nature too.
If there are sweets, fabrics, gits in our homes, if there is delivery in then think about delivery out for a moment.
At least in our homes, which is in excess, which we dont use now, we must ensure delivery out of such things.
In many cities, start-ups of many NGOs and young colleagues do this work.
They collect everything from their homes, clothing, sweets, food and search for the needy and carry them out anonymous activities.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate the darkness under this lamp
The smile on the faces of many poor families, on the festivals, your happiness will double, your face will shine, your face will shine and your brightness will become brighter and your Diwali will become brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, in the form of good fortune and prosperity, Lakshmi gets home.
In our culture, daughters have been considered as Lakshmi, because daughter brings good fortune and prosperity.
Can we honour India's Lakshmi on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many daughters, many who will be doing extraordinary work
Somebody will be working to educate the poor children, someone will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, someone will be serving the society by becoming a doctor, engineer.
By becoming a lawyer, someone would try to get justice
Our society should identify such daughters, respect them and take pride in them.
Their programs of honor, be across the country
One more thing can be done, about the achievements of these daughters, share maximum in social media, and use Bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
Like all of us had launched a massive campaign, Selfie with Daughter and it spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we campaign India's Lakshmi
Promotion of Laxmi of India means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and its people
My dear countrymen, I had said this thing earlier that it is a great advantage that I get the opportunity to have a direct and indirect interaction with many strangers.
In the last few days, a student from remote Arunachal has sent me a big interesting letter, Alina Tayang.
And it says, I read the letter in front of you. Honorable Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when my exam result came, some people asked me if you read the Cam Warriors book
I told you, I haven't read this book
But, going back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was quite good .
I thought, if I had read this book before Yeam, I would have benefited a lot.
I liked many aspects of this book very well, but I also saw this thing that there are many mantras for students but there is not much in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first of all, thank you for writing the letter
Cam Warriors 2-3 times to read, thank you
You have said that if I get out during the new edition then I will try to write a few things for the participants and the teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share your experiences and suggestions on aspects related to stress-free exam.
I'll study it.
I will think about it and I will try to write whatever I feel right in my own words, in my own words and perhaps, if your suggestions are more then my new edition will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your views .
Once again I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Alina Tayang of Arunachal
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and through TV.
But, you don't know I'm a common man like you.
Had someone else been on this occasion, he would have been depressed and disappointed, but, his face was not melted, but he, with his words, smiled at everyone's faces.
Everyone was convinced that his humility, simplicity and the manner in which he saw the portsman spirit in letter and spirit in true sense.
The audience there welcomed their words warmly .
Even after losing in a tough fight , he praised his rival Nadal and gave a living evidence of sportsman spirit .
On the other hand , Champion Nadal also fervently appreciated Daniel's game.
The zeal of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner were worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is truly incredible .
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janayati Loksya Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person involves abilities and humility together, then who cant win his heart
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk now, I am doing it directly for your good.
it ' s very difficult to stop later on .
But, if we wake up at the beginning and stop him, a lot can be saved
With this feeling, I feel like, today, especially to my youth, I must do something.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The danger of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco .
Everyone says that
Tobacco intoxication is caused by the nicotine present in it .
Its consumption during adolescence also affects the development of the brain .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new topic
You must be aware that recently India has banned e-cigarette.
Decigarette is a type of electronic device different from the normal cigarette .
While we all understand the dangers of normal cigarettes well, a misconception about e-cigarette has been created.
There is an error spreading that there is no threat to e-cigarette
They try that, no family member should smoke, don't smoke
They know that with smoking, tobacco causes heavy losses to the body.
The drinker also knows and the seer knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different
There is not so much awareness among people about e-cigarette
They are completely unaware of its danger and sometimes because of this e-cigarette enters the house secretly in curiosity .
Our youth walks on the path of waste, unknowingly walks
In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to the e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, that, when someone smokes around us, we know it only from the smell.
In such a scenario, many adolescents and youngsters are seen roaming around in their books, in their offices, in their pockets and sometimes in their hands and they become victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country
e-cigarette has been banned so that this new way of intoxication does not destroy our young country
Do not trample the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted
These diseases, these habits should not root in the society.
I urge all of you to abandon the addiction of tobacco and do not make any misunderstanding regarding e-cigarette.
Let us all together build a healthy India
You have it ID
Do you remember India
India means a little bit here that hands and feet will be in gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening, so it will be
This is our Mother India, this is our country, Bahuratna Vasundhara.
Many human gems have emerged from this earth
India-Year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, it has been the land of action.
And these are the people who, not for themselves, have spent their lives for others.
Similar, a great figure is being honored in Vatican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary Threasia as saint on October 13
Sister Mary Threasia's work for the betterment of humanity in her short life span of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to social service and education.
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout his life, he was engaged in this mission.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Threasia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating 150th Gandhi, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from Single se Plastic.
Looking at the kind of leadership that India has taken in the direction of environmental protection, today the eyes of all countries are looking towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the campaign to get rid of Single se Plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way
However, a young man from our own country has launched a unique campaign.
My attention was to his work, so I tried to understand his new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
Maybe these things could also help other people of the country.
Mr. Rippudman Belvi ji is making a unique effort they do plogging
When I first heard the word plogging , it was also new to me .
In foreign countries , perhaps these words have been used in some quantities .
But, in India, Rippudman Belvi ji has promoted it very much.
Let ' s talk to them something .
I congratulate you all and my friends, this time on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Sports Ministry too has taken several initiatives in this direction.
On 2nd October, two kilometres of plogging will be held across the country.
We have heard from the experience of Rippudman ji how to do this programme and what happens in the programme.
This will not only take care of our health but will also protect the health of the Mother Earth .
This campaign is also increasing awareness about cleanliness among the people.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then their India will take 130 crore steps towards becoming free of single use plastic.
Ripudman ji, once again, thank you very much
And congratulations to you, your team and me for this new imagination.
want to move forward to transform our lives into countryside
One thing you want to remember in advance .
Well, I would like to elaborate it in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, but today I am saying something in advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So you start preparing from now on
I'm going to talk to you in detail but it's time now, some people can start practising, some plans
My dear countrymen, you will remember, on 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will visit 15 places in India.
Make at least 15 places and that too, one night, two night stay programmes
You see, understand, experience India
how many diversities we have
And when they come on holidays in the festival of Diwali, people definitely go and I will again urge you to visit any such 15 places of India.
Today our rank is thirty four and five years ago our rank was at number 65.
If we try more, by 75 years of independence, we will make our place in tourism in the major places of the world.
You must also see that, in the days of Diwali, firecrackers and firecrackers may not be damaged by any person.
Whatever objections should be made for this , you must object .
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard they have worked to make the Constitution of their own country full of diversity
The Konkan coastal area, where the ocean has an important role, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj. Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the beaches either surrounded by the sea. The Maratha Navy was responsible for the safety of these forts.
Even after thinking about it, there will be no soil, no trees and plants will grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the organism be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that the use of urea more than necessary causes serious damage to the soil. The farmer is the son of the soil, how can the farmer see the mother and mother sick
The need of the hour is to awaken the relations of this mother-son once again. Can our farmers, our sons and the children of our soil make a solemn pledge that today the number of urea that he uses in his fields will stop half of its use by 2022 when it will be 75 years of independence
Answer: The person of India will not know what is in South India
The person of West-India will not know what is in east-India
If we look at the diversity of our country, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda ji, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, then it comes to us that when he traveled to India, he got a new inspiration to see India and to live for it. All these great personalities visited India extensively. At the beginning of their work they tried to know India, try to understand India. Can we try to live in different states of our country, different societies, groups, their customs, their traditions, their traditions, their prestige, their beliefs as a student
Can you keep the hash tag on IncredibleIndia
You will see, when all the people of one state will say this thing then I will ask the government to scrutiny it and prepare publicity literature on the seven things that have come from every state. In a way, how to promote tourist destination with the intentions of the people
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On one hand the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when there are reports of violence from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to be worried .
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the country of Sardar Patel who laid down his life for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, non-violence and respect.
Ahimsa Parmo Dharma: We have been listening since childhood, have come to say
I want to assure the countrymen, those who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, these countries will never tolerate or tolerate any government.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food habits, lifestyles and dresses.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life .
Even our festivals are full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old, see cultural traditions, see social traditions, see historical events, there will hardly be a single day left in 365 days.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals are followed in accordance with the leaflets of nature.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly related to the farmers and fishermen.
Today , I am talking about festivals , first of all , I would like to call you all lucky dukkadam .
Celebration of Sanvatsari celebrated in Jain Samaj yesterday
In Jain society festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra .
The last day of the festival is the sabbath day .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself .
The festival of Sanvatsari symbolizes forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
In a way it is also called the forgiveness festival and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michami Dukkadam .
Anyway , forgiveness in our scriptures is Virasya Bhushan , that is , the Bhushan of forgiveness heroes .
He is a hero who forgives
We have been listening to these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say sorry is the specialty of a powerful person .
Shakespeare wrote in his drama The Merchant of Enice, describing the importance of forgiveness, Mercy is twice blast, I not blesseth him that gives and him that takes i.e. forgiveness and forgiveness, both receive God's blessings.
My dear countrymen, these days, Ganesh Chaturthi is in every corner of India. And when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to talk about public Ganesh Festival.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before 125 years of independence he became a symbol of the freedom movement .
And after independence, they have become symbols of social education, social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days .
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity .
My best wishes to all the countrymen for Ganesh Festival
Onam is being celebrated in Kerala right now
One of the colourful festivals of India , Onam is a major festival of Kerala .
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society and creates a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of people.
And now these festivals are also becoming a reason for the tourism attraction.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal has become a tourism attraction in a way .
Our festivals and ours are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction
A few days later, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country in the series of these festivals.
Many congratulations and good wishes to all the countrymen on Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us, but also a symbol of cleanliness of festivals in New India.
Festivals and sanitation are associated with family life .
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness
It ' s not something new to us , but it ' s important to create social temperament .
Public sanitation insists on cleanliness not only in our homes but also in our villages, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country, it should be an integral part of these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you may be, how modern your thought process is, a scale has also been used to know all these things and how aware you are towards environment.
Eco-friendly, environment friendly behavior is against your activities.
If society is against it , it is considered bad today .
And as a result of this thing today I can see that these days there has been a massive campaign in Ganeshotsav also.
If you visit YouTube and see that children are making Ganesh ji in every household, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Like many are being used in every family
See how a big change has come and this is a pleasant change .
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago when the campaign for cleanliness was started, it will be three years on 2nd October.
And, its positive results are visible
Nearly 67 toilets have reached from Coverage 39
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves ODF.
There was a severe flood in Gujarat in the past
A lot of people lost their lives , but when the water subsided after the flood , so much filth had flourished everywhere .
At such a time, in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat, workers of Jamiat Ulemahind cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Made yourself sweat, everybody got out
The best example of unity for cleanliness, an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulemahind gave it.
If this becomes our sustainable nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I once again invite all of you that once again 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, Swachhta Hi Seva was the first to say that Jal Seva, this is the Lord Seva, Swachhata Hi Seva campaign should be launched.
Create an environment for cleanliness across the country
Wherever we get the opportunity, wherever we get the opportunity, we find opportunities.
But we all join
Assume this as the preparation of Diwali in a way, accept it as the preparation of Navratri, accept the preparation of Durga Puja
My friends in social media can run some creative campaigns and motivate Virtual World to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi Competition, this campaign by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which you are a competition in essays, Short Film Making Competition, Painting Competition is being organized.
In this you can write essays in different languages and they have no age limits, no face limits
You can make short film, make it from your mobile
Can make a 2-3 minute film that inspires cleanliness
She could be in any language, she could be silent.
You see, how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine
You can imagine how a sacred joy will be within us to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, I would like to acknowledge a special loan of all of you today.
I want to express my gratitude from the depths of my heart, not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long. I want to express my gratitude and accept the loan because millions of people from every corner of the country join this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores, but millions of people write letters to me, sometimes give me messages, sometimes a message comes on the phone, I have a huge treasure.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than what you wait for .
I ' m sorry because every thing you ' ve got to learn from me
You might think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake.
Sometimes something becomes a part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking to Aparna from Poona
I want to tell you about one of my friends
She always tries to help people , but I am surprised to see her habit .
I once went to the shopping mall with her
He spent two thousand rupees comfortably on a sari and Rs 450 on a pizza, while the auto driver who had taken the auto for going to the mall was bargaining for five rupees for a long time.
Buy a vegetable on the way back and save Rs 4-5 on every vegetable again.
I feel very bad
You must tell me about your mind .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you might have been shocked and alerted and perhaps you might have decided not to make such a mistake in the future.
Do you not think that whenever we come here to sell some goods around our house, there is a ferry operator, we have a relationship with some small shopkeeper or seller of vegetables, sometimes we have a connection with the auto-rickshaw driver, whenever we come in contact with some hardworking person then we start to negotiate with him, we start negotiating with him, not so much but reduce it by two rupees, reduce it by five rupees.
And we are the ones who go to a big restaurant to eat food so they don't see what is written in the bills, they pay the money in a big way.
Not only this, they buy saris in showrooms, they do not make any difference but if their relationship with the poor comes then they do not live without bargaining.
Have you ever wondered what will happen to the poor
Two Rupees five Rupees do not make any difference in your life but how deep your habit of putting an end to your mind has you ever thought it
Madam, I am grateful to you for calling me a phone call that touches so much.
I am sure that my countrymen too will leave the habit of behaving like this with the poor .
My dear young friends, on August 29, the entire country celebrates as National Sports Day.
This is the birthday of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey was incomparable
I am reminding you that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports become part of our lives
If we are the youngest countries in the world then we should also look at these youngsters in the field of sports
Sports i. e. physical extension, mental alertness, personality enhancment, I understand what is more than that
Sports is in a way a very big herb of heart matching .
The young generation of our country has come forward in the field of sports and today in the era of computer I would also like to warn that playing field is more important than play-down.
Play A , but even outside the field , sometimes acting with Cootball .
Crickets may be playing on the computer but the pleasure of playing cricket under the sky in the open ground is something else .
There was a time when the family kids used to go out and the mother first asked when you would be back .
Today the condition is such that as soon as the children come home they see cartoon film in one corner either stick to the mobile game and then they shout to the mother and say: When will you go out
It is a matter of great happiness for our youngsters that India is going to host an IAF Under 17 World Cup from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world, our sports festivals, enjoy sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about the game today, I would like to share with my countrymen the event that has touched my mind last week.
I had the opportunity to meet some daughters of a very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas
Will spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes spend 30-30 days in water
Our six daughters with courage in the midst of the waves of the ocean and this is the first event in the world
Who are Hindustanis who don ' t blame our daughters
I salute the greetings of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModi App so that you can read them because in a way this is a story of courage, self-confidence and I will be happy to convey to you the words of these daughters.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we celebrate Teachers Day.
This is the birthday of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was president but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I salute him, the great scientist Albert Einstein said.
Not is the Supreme Cart of the Teacher to Lawaken Joy in Creative Expression and Knowledge. To enjoy creative sentiments and knowledge among your students is the most important quality of a teacher.
This time when we celebrate Teachers ' Day , can we all make a resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts, we will play a major role in the transformation of the nation.
Let ' s take this mantra to transform
Prime Minister
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai city and work for the India Research Centre of Howard University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been the subject of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world.
The campaign was launched on August 28, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Campaign for Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana to be held for three years tomorrow, 28th August
30 crore new households have been linked with this and bank accounts have been opened.
This number is more than the population of many countries of the world .
Today, it is a great solution to me that within three years my poor brothers and sisters sitting at that last corner of the society have become a part of the fundamentals of the country's economy and their habits have changed, they have started coming to the bank, they have started saving money, they are feeling the security of the money.
Sometimes money lives in hand, lives in zeb, lives in the house, then he feels like spending a lot of money.
Money will be useful if there is a good job in the coming days
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, nearly 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks by our poor people.
This is the saving of the poor in a way. This is the strength of the poor in the coming days.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana whose accounts are open, it has also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Rupees One Rupee and Thirty Rupees a very small premium, today it creates a new faith in the lives of the poor.
In several households, due to the insurance of one rupee, the poor man faced a crisis, the head of the family lost his life and in a few days he got two lakh rupees.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the Start-up scheme, the Stand-up scheme, the Dalit, the tribal, the women, the educated youth, the youngsters who want to do something on their feet, the crores of youngsters, the banks, the banks without any guarantee of any guarantee have made a successful attempt to provide employment to each and every one or two people.
Today, this is not enough time but I would definitely like to tell the people of Bank that they should upload it on MyGov. in, people will read it, people will get inspiration from it that how a scheme brings about a change in the life of a person, how a new energy fills up, how a new faith fills me with, hundreds of examples have come to me.
I will do my best to reach you and it is an inspiring event that the people of Media can take full advantage of it.
They can also inspire the new generation by interviewing with such people.
Man's mind is such that the rainy season is a very lucrative period for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature everybody gets cheerful on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a formidable look, then it is known that there is a great power to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, keeps us alive, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, its gruesome nature destroys us.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and environment are also taking place in a very negative impact.
Over the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and parts of Bengal, have faced natural calamities due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a broad level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching there.
State Governments are also making every effort to help flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with service are also making every effort to help people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, Army personnel, Air Force personnel, NDRF personnel, Paramilitary Forces, everyone joins in serving the disaster victims at such times.
And 247 Control from Helpline number 1078 has been continuously working to tackle the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by drilling the mock at maximum places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were set up.
Gradually, we also made the nature that according to the weather forecast, we can also create our activities, so we can avoid losses.
Whenever I am preparing for the matter of mind, I can see that more citizens of the country prepare for it than me.
This time there have been so many letters regarding GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness and curiosity regarding GST.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your hardered accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax - GST was launched in our country on the same date last month.
Can you tell me whether the results are coming after a month just as the government had expected
I would like to hear your views on this, thank you.
It has been almost a month since GST came into force and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very satisfied and happy that whenever a poor person writes to me in a letter asking me how GST has reduced the prices of goods and how things have become cheaper.
If a person living in the north-east, remote mountains and forests writes a letter that he was initially scared of what he didn't know but now when I started learning and understanding it, I think it has become easier than ever before.
Business became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' confidence in the trader has started to grow.
I was just witnessing the impact of GST on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How is the time decreasing the distance
Highways clutter has been refreshed.
Due to the speed of trucks, pollution has also decreased.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This facility is not only there but it also strengthens the economic momentum.
Earlier, due to being a separate tax structure, maximum resources of transport and logistics sector were required to be maintained and they were required to create new warehouses in every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has truly created a very positive impact on our economy and in a very short time.
The speed at which smooth transition has taken place, the speed at which migration has taken place, new registrations have taken place, this has created a new faith in the entire country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of the management, the pundits of technology, they will definitely write the use of GST in the form of a model before the world.
It will become a case study for many universities of the world.
It is a great height of success in implementing it in such a vast country and successfully moving forward on such a big scale and with the involution of crores of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation and responsibility of all the states.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with the consensus.
And as a result of that every government had the same priority that due to GST there should not be any burden on the poor plate.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments, all the districts of the central and state governments engaged in this work.
GST is a good example of the success of Indias collective strength.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but an economy that strengthens the culture of a new integrity.
There is also a campaign for social reform in a way.
Once again, I salute my fellow countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of Revolution.
We have easily heard this thing since childhood and this is the reason that the Non-Cooperation Movement started on 1st August, 1920.
The uit India Movement commenced on August 9, 1942, known as the August Revolution and the country became independent on August 15, 1947.
In a way, many incidents in the month of August are specially linked to the independence.
But very few people know that this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali, uit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
The pages of history are our inspiration for building a grand India from 1857 to 1942.
The heroes of our freedom have made sacrifices, penance and sacrifices and what can be a big inspiration.
uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indian freedom movement.
This movement had resolved the entire country for the liberation of the British Raj.
This was the time when the Indian public in opposition to British rule had become a part of the uit India Movement in every corner of India be it villages, cities or cities, be it illiterate, be it poor or rich.
People's anger was at its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were struggling their lives with the mantra of Do or Die.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their studies and left their books.
The Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The forms of non-cooperation movement were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of do or die.
There was peoples support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all this success.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if we look at the pages of history slightly then India's first war of independence took place in 1857.
Starting from 1857, the freedom struggle continued in every corner of the country till 1942.
This long period has created a curiosity of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to do something.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, join, go, get new, get new, get connected and the country has been trying its best to overthrow the British rule.
This struggle, from 1857 to 1942, created a situation where 1942 reached its peak and quit India so badly that within 5 years the British had to go in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the people of Lalak.
And from 1942 to 1947, this became a peoples mind, it became the reason for the country's independence with success as a five decisive year of siddhi.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's been almost 70 years.
Governments came-gain
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone made efforts in their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes also found.
Expectations also awakened
Like 1942 to 1947 Sankalp was a decisive five years of Siddhi.
I can see that from 2017 to 2022, a five year stretch of achievement has come to us.
On 15th August, 2017, we will celebrate Sankalp Parv and in 2022, when we mark 75 years of independence, we will continue to transform that resolution into accomplishment.
There should be crores of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolves.
So, just as 1942 to 1947 became the decisive destination for the country's independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022 can also be crucial for the future of India.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence of the country.
Then all of us have to take a firm resolve today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolve.
This is the month of August, we have to connect with the resolution and we have to make a resolution.
Let us run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from the resolution of August 9 this month.
A resolution that we will achieve in the next five years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can highlight new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
As a person, what can I contribute to it
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Video, post, block, articles, new ideas used in technology have brought everything.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
It is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread and spread it extensively.
My dear countrymen, August 15, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am just one moment and he doesn't speak.
The voice of 1. 25 billion Indians resonates from the Red Fort.
And I am glad that every corner of the country gets suggestions from every corner of the country for the last three years on 15th August, what should I say on 15th August, what issues should I take
This time also I invite you to send your ideas on MyGov either on NarendraModiApp.
I read it myself and will try to disclose it in whatever time I have on August 15.
In my speeches on 15th August last 3 times, I have been continuously hearing a complaint that my speech becomes a bit longer.
I have tried to make rules for me in 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I'll be able to.
But I intend to try this time how to shorten my speech .
Let's see if success is achieved or not.
My countrymen, I want to do one more thing today.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate that.
Our festivals, our festivals, these are not just occasions of joy and happiness.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign of social reform.
And a natural pleasure is also added to these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Add individuals and society.
A comfortable journey runs from the person to the summit.
There is an opportunity to go from ego to yam.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhi in small domestic industries.
From khadi to silk threads, how many kinds of rakhis and nowadays people prefer homemade rakhis more.
Thousands of Rakhi makers, Rakhia sellers, sweets and hundreds of businesses are associated with a festival.
Our own poor brothers and sisters, the family runs through this.
We light a lamp in Deepawali, it is not just a light festival, it is just a festival and it is not like that.
It is directly related to those poor families who make small clay laden soils.
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more conscious than me, more active.
For the last one month, conscious citizens have written letters to me for the past one month.
And he has requested you to tell Ganesh Chaturthi about the eco-friendly Ganesh in time so that people can plan the soil of Ganesh.
At the outset, I am grateful to such conscious citizens.
He has urged me to talk about this topic before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
25 billion Indians, Lokmanya Tilak ji started a public Ganeshotsav for the unity of the society and for the awareness of the society and for the masses.
Once again, let us compete with essays in this year of Ganeshotsav, make discussions, remember the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and this will benefit the poor artisans, poor artists and idols will get employment and fill the poorest of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters, be it education sector or be it economic sector or be it social sector or be it sports, are illuminating the country's name and attaining new heights.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
In the past, our daughters have performed well in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportsperson daughters this week.
I was very pleased to talk to them, but I was feeling that they could not win the World Up.
He had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said, See, nowadays, the era of media is such that expectations are enhanced so much and when success is not achieved then it becomes even more provocative.
We have seen many such games that if India's players fail, then the anger of the country breaks down on those players.
Some people say such things by breaking the limits and writing such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters did not let any burden fall on those daughters but also praised them for what they did.
I see a pleasant change in this thing and I asked these daughters to see that you have got such a good fortune only to you people.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hundred and fifty million people.
My dear countrymen, I once again remind you of the August Revolution. On 9th August, I am reminding you once again on 15th August, I once again remind you of 75 years of Independence.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge, every countryman should prepare a roadmap of 5 years to realise this resolve.
We all have to take the country to new heights and take it to new heights.
Come, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with this belief that the fate of the country will be good.
Weather is changing
This time the heat is too much
But it ' s good that the rain is moving on its footsteps on time .
In many parts of the country the weather has become pleasant with Jhajjham rain
After the rains cold winds have been relieved from the heat of the past days .
And all of us have seen that how much hurdle in life, how much stress, how much stress, whether individual life or public life, the advent of rain also changes our mood.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath celebrates with great reverence and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the rath yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
And the poorest of the country is associated with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor .
And very few people will know that there is a word in English language juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in the directional meaning of this juggernaut it is also found that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannath .
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I offer my greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and also bow down to Lord Jagannath ji in Shricharan .
India's diversity is also its specialty, India's diversity is also India's strength.
The holy month of Ramadan celebrated with holy feelings in distant worship .
Now is the festival of Eid
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my best wishes to all of you on behalf of me.
The month of Ramzan is the month of virtue charity, the month of distributing happiness, and the more happiness you share, the more happiness increases.
Let us all collectively take inspiration from these holy festivals and share the treasures of the joyous ones and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a big inspiring incident in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in that small village. In a way, more population belongs to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together .
And this individual toilet also provides assistance from the government and the assistance amounting to Rs 17 lakh was given to them .
Spend these 17 lakhs for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for turning this holy occasion of Ramzan into an occasion for the betterment of the society.
We know that there are three states in our country - Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala - they have already been declared open defecation free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced this week
I express my special gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We are very well aware that if anything is to be done in the life of a person, if anything is to be done in the life of a society then it has to work very hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if we have to fix it, then we have to strive for a long time to be very aware.
Then the habit of the body, the mind changes.
The theme of cleanliness is the same .
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature .
Everyone will have to draw attention .
Good motivational events have to be remembered again and again
And I am glad that today cleanliness is not a government programme
It has been becoming a movement of the masses and the masses.
And when the people sitting in the government take this work forward with the participation of the people then how much power is there
In the past, a very good event came to my notice, which I would like to tell you
This is the incident in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh .
The administration there took up a big task with public participation
100 hours non stop campaign
And what was the goal
Construction of 10,000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the public and the government have successfully completed the work of constructing ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district for setting an example of hard work.
They come to NarendraModiApp, come to MyGov.in, come from letters, come to AIR.
Shri Prakash Tripathi commemorating the Emergency has written that on 25th June he has presented the history of democracy as a black period.
This awareness about Prakash Tripathi's democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system, it is also a ritual.
Eternal awareness of democracy is essential and hence democracy has to be remembered and moved towards good things of democracy.
1975-25 June - it was a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into a prison.
The opposite voice was suppressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Jayaprakash Narayan were jailed.
Even the judicial system could not escape the shadow of that terrible form of emergency.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
The lovers of democracy fought a big battle and a country like India, such a vast country, whenever they got the opportunity, how democracy prevails in the rhythm of the people of India, they demonstrated that power through elections.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world over.
21st June, 2017 The entire world has become Yoga.
People from water to mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Who will be a Hindustani, who will not be proud of this thing
Its not like that Yoga was not there earlier, but today when Yoga is tied in the thread of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
In China, the Great Hall of China was practiced by people, while in Peru, people performed 2400 meters above sea level at World Heritage Site Machu Picchu.
In France, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, people made a contribution.
In small places like Singapore, programmes were held at 70 locations and they have launched a week-long campaign.
NHAI has taken out 10 Stamps of International Day of Yoga.
A Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised in NH-18.
Everybody participated in the NCC stature and the diplomacy of the world.
This time again Yoga also worked as a world record
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad made a new world record by simultaneously doing Yoga.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I had the privilege of doing yoga in the rain .
Our soldiers also participated in Siachen where there is a minus 20, 25, 40 degree temperature.
Whether it is TBP or RPO or ISC, everyone has made Yoga a part of their duty as well.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because it was the 3rd International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photographs while doing Yoga together.
Some T Channel also carried this thing forward
Sir, one of my questions is that in Kerala, we had heard that we should give kind of good books to the people of Kerala as a memento in place of the box that we give on different-different platforms.
You had started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but we cannot see it anymore.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had formed a tradition in the government that we will not give a bouquet, we will give a book, either hand-craft or handkerchief will welcome it.
And the handkerchief of Khadi so that Khadi can be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become a habit, but after coming here I missed that habit.
But went to Kerala, once again he became aware
And I ' ve just started giving information to the government again .
We can also gradually create a habit
And bouet ' s AYUSH is very low .
Take it once in hand, then leave it
But if books are given, then in a way it becomes part of the household, becomes part of the family.
And when I ' m saying this, how historical is the value of such things
When I visited KYC last year, Britain's ueen, ueen Liabeth invited me to dinner.
There was a parental atmosphere
He also fed me with great love, but later he showed me a small khadi and a handkerchie woven with thread in a very emotional voice, and his eyes were shining, he said that when I was married, this handkerchie Mahatma Gandhi had sent me in the form of a wedding greeting.
How many years have it been, however, ueen Liabeth has kept this handkerchief handled by Mahatma Gandhi.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life, a part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be victims of criticism.
But in spite of this, we should continue to do such things, we should keep on trying.
Now I cant say that I will go somewhere and someone will come with a bouquet, I will refuse it, I will not be able to do it.
But still there will be criticism, but if you continue to talk, then gradually improvement will also happen.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are several types of works.
They are immersed in files, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and that gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come, different types of people write letters
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter, I think I must tell you.
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arulmozhi Saranan - he sent a letter to me
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in the minds of children in my family then it would be a bit helpful to the family.
So I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started some work in the direction of supplying some goods from the market.
So I came to know that the government of India has created a system called Governance-Marketplace.
So I have registrated myself in it. I want to tell the countrymen that if you get the opportunity then you will get the opportunity to do so.
is a new kind of system .
And then he has to order
So all the departments of the government are watching those people who register under GDM.
Goods get very cheap because there is no intermediary .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has made all the registration of the goods that he can provide on this website of the government.
And it's fun that the letter he wrote to me is very interesting.
This is the empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship
Perhaps if Arulmozhi ji had not written to me, I too would not have noticed that a housewife is doing a small thing far away from the system of GMC, its goods can be bought to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country .
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I would surely like those who want to sell their goods to the government to join more than that.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Governance is a great example of this and its goal is minimum price and mimum ease, efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in Space Science.
And this is the speciality of India that if our feet are on the earth associated with Yoga then our dreams are also to cross those horizons of far-flung heavens.
India has done a lot in sports and science in the past.
Today, India is hoisting its flag not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano Satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite
And these satellites include about 14 countries like French, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and USA - besides India.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of agriculture and in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the wealthiest heaviest satellite in the satellite launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it to the weight of its elephant so you can imagine the great work our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June a thousand days of the Mars mission have been completed
You would be aware of the fact that when we successfully created a place in Forbit for the Mars mission, the entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
The completion of a thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space travel.
In sports these days we are also seeing that the trend of our youth is increasing .
Now it has started to be seen that along with studies, our younger generation has started showing their future in sports. And because of their hard work and achievement the name of the country also gets illuminated.
Recently India's badminton player Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the value of the country.
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track of PT Usha jis Shah School of Athletics.
The more we promote sports, sports and sportsman spirits we also bring
Sports also plays a very important role in the development of personality .
The importance of sports in overall personality development is very high .
There is no shortage of talent in the country .
If children in our family also have an interest in sports then they should be given an opportunity.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
And once again my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of rain, the atmosphere of constant festivals, in a way the experience of this period is new.
Once again I would like to convey my best wishes to all of you and talk to you again during the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, as I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the auspicious month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, on the auspicious occasion of this holy month.
This is a country that believes in God and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, all kinds of ideology, all kinds of worship, all kinds of traditions, we have assimilated the art of living together.
And after all, be it religion or creed or be it ideology or be it tradition, this message gives us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramadan will definitely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
Once again my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a lot of people gave me feedback.
Personally, everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me my point.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not even heard everyone's message, so many things have come.
However, whatever I have seen from the brief perspective, some people have tried to learn music, some are trying to learn new instruments, some people are trying to learn new things using YouTube and they are trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing nature, living and understanding are trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle India had to face, how much sacrifice and how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to the present generation in this regard.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Many years ago I went to Andaman and Nicobar.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar Ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book written by Mazi in jail.
Used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of torture will the freedom fighters have suffered
When I read a book on Savarkar ji's birth and that inspired me to see a cellular jail.
A light and sound show also runs there, it is a motivation.
There was no state in India, there would be no language speaker of India who would not have spent his life in this Cellular Jail, in the jail of Andamans where he was sentenced to black water for freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I would certainly like to tell the young generation of the country what kind of torture and suffering we had received, if we visit the Cellular Jail and see why black water was called
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connect with nature means nurturing the better planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times: One must care about a world one will not see, that is, it is our duty to care about the world that we do not see.
You have come very tired, open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
A new energy is manifested in our body when the five great souls are connected.
We all have experienced this thing but we dont register it. We dont connect it with a single thread.
After this you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and that is why the global campaign of 5th June should also be our own campaign of engagement with nature.
Our ancestors protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root of power.
And Atharvaveda is thoroughly, in a way, the largest guiding book of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told that Mata Bhoomi: Son ego separates:
The Vedas say that the nature we have in us is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her son.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is evident that Mahatma Buddha was born, he attained knowledge and his great Parinirvana was under the three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A massive drive for plantation is underway in almost all the states as soon as there is rainfall.
Plants are planted in the number of crores.
School children are also linked, social-service organizations, NGOs, governments themselves take initiative.
We should also contribute to this work of plantation in this year's year.
My dear countrymen, June 21 has now become a known day for the world.
As World Yoga Day, the whole world celebrates it.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day of 21st June has been successful in every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, many powers of scattering around the world are showing their distorted faces. At such a time, India has a great contribution to the world.
We have added the world to a formula through yoga.
Like Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to the lifestyle, due to catastrophe, due to rising responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
And this situation has reached even at a young age.
Taking uninterrupted medicines and passing the day, the role of yoga is crucial for living a stress-free life in such a time.
Yoga is a guarantee of both wellness and itsness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga to realise how a transition from body to mind, body, ideas and conduct to health is possible.
Just two days back, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga, some prizes have been announced.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and told me that you appeal that this time three generations of the same family should be together on the third International Yoga Day.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents, parents, sons and daughters, all the three generations should do yoga together and upload their picture.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be such a good coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had launched the campaign of selfie with daughter, we had a very interesting experience.
The picture of this three generation Yoga will surely awaken the praise for the country and the world.
You must send me a picture on NarendraModiApp, on MyGov, wherever three generations of Yoga perform, all the three generations of people should send me a picture together.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be the guarantee of tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have nearly three weeks to celebrate International Day of Yoga.
You should also propagate the topic of Yoga for three weeks continuously, spread it, add people to it.
In a way, this is a preventive health care movement.
I invite all of you to join me.
This phone call will also bring you to mind: Pranam Modi ji, I am Naina from Mumbai.
Today I have always seen that wherever you go, the people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
On your call, be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
Old and big, children also have awareness about cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, sticking.
The government machinery works as a cleaning work, but these days there is also a celebration of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are plenty of cleaning programs.
Media also gives him immense priority and just a few days ago I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
Very big cleaning campaign went there.
I did not even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I also started thinking and I saw that this thing is right.
You can imagine how happy I am and how the country is noticing these things in a better way.
What would be a greater pleasure for me that cleanliness has also been added to my journey.
The rest of the preparations will be habituated to the Prime Minister's reception - it will be a habit, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is inspiring and enjoying for any cleanliness loving person in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
Modi ji, when you are on your way to this place, ask whoever stays there, if you want to call me then what will be the level of cleanliness
I decide my stay on the basis of how many tons of garbage will you offer me.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big will the work of humanity be
One thing I would like to say is that we do not consider waste as wealth is a resource.
Do not just look at it as a garbage.
Once we start treating this waste as wealth then several new methods of waste management will be revealed to us.
The Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of waste management with the help of peoples representatives of cities with the help of State Governments.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, similar means are going to be available to elect solid waste and liquid waste in about 4,000 cities of the country.
There will be two types of dustbins, one of green colours and another of blue colours.
Like kitchen waste, vegetable peels, remaining food, egg peels, tree leaves etc. all these are wet waste and put them in green dustbin.
All these things are useful in the fields and if you remember the green color of the field then you will remember what to put in the green dustbin.
Today, I am proud to mention one thing - even if a person decides in his mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
This is the work of cleanliness.
And just like the folk culture, he added people from all over the area and converted them into peoples movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I was told that the Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir has become open defecation free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been led by the women of that area of Jammu Kashmir.
He took out torch trips to spread awareness and inspired people from every household, street and street.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, months, continuous newspapers, TV channels, social media, the current government has been accounting for 3 years.
I see this whole process as a very healthy signs.
On every criterion, this 3-year term has been done.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
And there is a good process in democracy.
And I have a clear belief that governments should be accountable in democracy, the public should account for their work.
I thank all those people who took time out to deliberate upon our work, somewhere appreciated, somewhere supported, somewhere deficiencies were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
It is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, to learn from it and to move forward with the help of it.
Constructive creativity strengthens democracy.
For a conscious nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as an ordinary citizen, the impact of good and bad things on me is the same as on the minds of an ordinary citizen.
Some people criticise him politically but after such a long time I feel that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even think about it.
It seems as if I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me these things by writing.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and Speaker Madam for taking time out and the people sitting in such senior positions gave this importance to the mindset.
In a way, giving a new dimension to the mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on this book of mind, I had ever discussed it with me.
Akbar Saheb proposed that the topics that have been discussed in Mann Ki Baat want to be prepared and given a sketch through his art and to showcase his love and affection without taking a single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, till the next time we meet, the rains will have come in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have changed, the results of the examinations will start from a new beginning.
Let us all move forward in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
s.
What could be a little emphasis on this aspect in skill development
You drive the cycle, but the cycle with three-wheeler that takes people away has you ever tried to run
Most families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the exams of their children
Those whose exams have been finished, there will be some relief and there will still be some pressure in those families where the exam will be running.
But at such a time I would like to say that the last time I have talked to the students, listen to them again, those things will definitely help you at the time of the examination.
Today is March 26
March 26 is the day of Bangladesh's Independence
A historic battle against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu
And I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region by working shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, our shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
One very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize , but also the British gave him the Knighthood degree .
And when the British slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voices and this was the period when the incident had a profound impact on the minds of a 12 year old child.
The brutal assassination of Jallianwala Bagh inspired the child who laughed at the farm and barn in his adolescence.
In 1919, the 12 year old Bhagat was our favourite and inspired by all of us - Shahid Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that on 23rd March the incident - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had no fear of serving Mother India - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were incorporated for the independence of Mother India.
And these three bravehearts are still an inspiration for all of us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words
And the entire British rule was afraid of these three young men .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but how to go ahead with them, the British were worried about it.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23.
Theft was done secretly, which is not usually done
And later, by bringing their bodies to Punjab today, the British burnt them quietly.
Several years ago when I had the opportunity to visit that place, I used to experience a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would certainly say to the youth of the country - whenever there is a chance whenever they go to Punjab, they must visit Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt's mausoleum.
This was the period when the curiosity of freedom, its intensity, its scope was increasing.
On one hand heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So exactly a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi did Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha
In the freedom movement of India, the Gandhian thought and the Gandhian style, its manifestation was first seen in Champaran.
It was a turning point in the entire freedom movement, especially in the form of struggle.
This was the period when the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the mill-labor strike in Ahmedabad and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and style of functioning was visible.
In 1915 Gandhi returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country .
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds today.
Imagine a man who came back to India in 1915, just two years' tenure
Neither the country knew them nor their influence, it was just the beginning.
We can guess how hard they had to face at that time, how hard they had to work.
And the Champaran Satyagraha was such that the organisation of Mahatma Gandhi, the skill of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the pulse of Indian society, the power of Mahatma Gandhi to organise, motivate and motivate the illiterate, the illiterate, the illiterate, the illiterate and the illiterate in front of the British empire by his practice, this magnificent power shows the miraculous power.
And that is why the way we realize the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi
But if you think of Gandhi Ji a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started public life.
We can learn from them how to start public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And it was a time when we listened to the names of the great leaders as well as the names of those great leaders. Gandhiji had sent them to the villages like Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji.
Prisoning on one side, on the other hand, in creative tasks.
A wonderful balance was in the style of Gandhiji.
What is the word satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a great sultanate - a whole new distinction Gandhi established by a successful experiment, not by words.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who will be the Indian who does not want to change India, who will be the Indian, who does not want to become a partner for change in the country
India is neither a government program nor a political party manifestation nor a project.
India calls upon 1. 25 billion Indians
This is the feeling that 1. 25 billion Indians want to make a grand India together.
There are many people who go to hospital every day, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know.
There are many people who are hungry, they worry about their food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara
Public service is the service of the Lord, it is in our veins
Once we look at it as a collective, organized, how powerful it is.
If it comes to India, it is very natural to be criticized, to have discussions, to see it from different perspectives, and it is inevitable in democracy.
But it is true that the dream of 1. 25 billion Indians can be realised in front of our eyes if they make a resolution and take a pledge to realise it.
And it is not necessary that all these things are from the budget, from the government projects, from government funds.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with complete honesty, if every citizen resolves that I will not use petrol-diesel one day in a week.
You can see that this country which is dreaming of a New India, 1. 25 billion Indians will be able to realise it before their eyes.
The meaning of saying is that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows his duty.
So why shouldn't we engage with Swaraj in this journey of Suraj by disciplining our lives
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I also want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, we have created such an environment and a large number of people have joined the Digital Payments Digital Movement.
The curiosity of how cash transactions can be done without cash has also increased, the poorest of the poor is also trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards doing business without cash.
Since the demonetization ban, there has been considerable increase in the different methods of digital payments .
My dear countrymen, we have to take the fight against black money and corruption forward.
25 billion Indians can pledge to do 2. 5 billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You don't have a imagination, but you can do a great service to the country and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past several programmes have been organized for public education and for public awareness.
There is a pledge to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programmes have been done
There was also a reward plan
About 12 . 5 million people have received this reward with a consumer .
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
And as it was decided a long time ago, this Digi-Festival will conclude on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
After a hundred days , a big event is going to take place .
There is also a provision of a very big draw.
How to reduce cash, how to reduce the behaviour of notes, we contribute to it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions.
But I have seen that every time there is a constant insistence on cleanliness
A daughter named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a student of 11th, has phoned message from Dehradun: Honble Principal, Prime Minister, you are my respectful salute.
First of all, congratulate you that you have won this election with huge votes
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is .
I go through a river in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
That river comes through the Rispana bridge and comes to my house .
For this river we went to the villages and took out a rally and interacted with the people , but it was of no use .
I want to tell you that by sending a team or through newspaper this thing should be highlighted, thank you
See brothers and sisters, how much pain is the pain of a daughter of class 11th
Looking at the garbage in that river, how angry he is
I think this is a good sign .
This is what I want to say, 1. 25 billion Indians should get angry with the filth.
Once anger is created, anger will be created, anger will be created against it, we will start doing something against filth.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, he is also suggesting to me, but at the same time he is also saying that he made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement .
Hate for filth is also increasing .
Be it awareness or be it active participation or be it movement, it has its own importance.
But hygiene is more related to the habit .
The work is difficult, but it has to be done.
I believe that the sentiments that have awakened in the new generation of the country, in children, in students, in the youth, indicate good results in itself.
Whatever you are listening to Gayatri in today's mind, I would like to tell all the countrymen that Gayatri's message should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, ever since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat, I have been receiving several suggestions on one thing from the beginning and most of those people have expressed concerns regarding food waste.
Even half of the planets are not filled in the stomach and then they leave it there.
You have ever imagined that how much waste we were wasting our lives.
Have you ever wondered how many poor people can fill their stomachs if they do not give up their shoes
This is not the subject that needs to be explained.
However, when the mother serves to the younger children in our family, she says that the more you can eat, the more you can eat.
Some efforts are being made, but still the indifference on this subject is a treason.
There is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is a saving then the family also has economic benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this topic is such that the family also benefits.
I am not urging more on this subject, but I would like that this awareness should be increased.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India.
Their life can also inspire us not to join hands.
We take as much food as we have.
See, these are the paths for change.
And those who are conscious about the health of the body always say - keep your stomach a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on April 7.
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHO) by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word 'expression' but if literally means, then some people call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally and preserved.
The trouble is that even next to us we do not understand this thing and perhaps we are hesitant to talk openly about it.
The person who feels embarrassment does not speak anything because he feels a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there is no expression that cannot be freed from it.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is that instead of the expression of expression, its expression is required.
Between your friends, between friends, between parents, between brothers and sisters, openly tell me what is happening to you.
Sometimes the children living in hostels suffer more due to loneliness.
If everyone is going out somewhere in the house then he says - no, no, I dont have to come today - I like to live alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does
You must believe that it is the first step in the direction of expression.
If he doesn't like to live in a group, he is walking alone in one corner, then try not to let it happen.
Give him an opportunity to live in the midst of what he speaks openly.
Please motivate him for expression while talking about laughter and happiness. Please take out what frustration is there in him.
This is the best way .
and expression causes mental and physical illnesses .
As Diabetes becomes the host of all kinds of diseases, expression also destroys all our capabilities of sustaining, fighting, fighting and deciding.
Your friends, your family, your premises and your environment - these can stop you from going to the expression and if you have gone then you can bring it out.
There is another way .
Help your heart, share their happiness and sorrow, you will see that the pain inside you will vanish.
If you try to understand their sorrows, you will do it with a sense of service and a new confidence will be created in you.
You can easily lighten the burden of your mind by joining others, serving someone and serving someone selflessly.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Prayana Yoga helps a lot in getting rid of stress, getting rid of pressure, moving towards a happy mind.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion in your mind regarding the 3rd International Day of Yoga, then you must send me your suggestions through my mobile application, guide me.
The number of songs and poetic compositions you can produce in relation to Yoga should be done so that it can easily be understood by the people.
Today, I would like to talk to my mothers and sisters, because today there has been a lot of talk about health and health.
So in the past, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and it is welcome but at the same time, women also have special responsibilities.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision.
These working class women will now be given 26 weeks of pregnancy, delivery and maternity leave which used to be available for the first 12 weeks.
There are perhaps only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us.
India has taken a very important decision for these sisters.
And its basic aim is to take care of the newborn baby, the future citizen of India, to take good care of her in the early birth, to get the full love of her mother, then these children will grow up and become the trustees of the country.
Mothers health will also be good and that is why this is a very important decision.
This will benefit nearly 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
My dear countrymen, the holy festival of Ram Navami on 5th April is Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
May the life of all these great men continue to inspire us, give us the strength to resolve for a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Samvatsar, I extend my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
This is the time for the farmers to start harvesting after spring and get the fruits of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different forms in different corner of our country.
Gudi-Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Samvatsar Pooja in the area of Awadh, Jodi-Chital in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadha are celebrated on New Year.
Countless, India is a country full of such diversity.
Winter season is about to go
The spring season has knocked us all into life .
After autumn , new leaves start coming in the trees .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The magnificence of birds starts to feel like mind .
Not only flowers, fruits are also glittering in the sun on the branches of the tree.
The fruits of summer season begin to appear in spring only in the form of mango .
The yellow flowers of mustard in the fields bind the hopes of the farmers
Tesu or Palash flowers indicate the arrival of Holi .
Amir Khusro has given a very interesting description of the moments of this change of weather .
The festival of Vasant Panchami , Mahashivaratri and Holi illuminates the joys of human life .
In an atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are about to leave Falgun for the last month and are ready to welcome the new month of Chaitra.
Indeed , you are a coincidence of these two months .
At the outset, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for the suggestions and suggestions that come before Mann Ki Baat.
On NarendraModiApp, Twitter, Facebook, Post, I am grateful to all of you for this.
And so he said that I should give some information about the launch and interceptor mission of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, thank you very much that you recalled the example of Indias pride.
Whether it is poverty alleviation or prevention of diseases or be it connecting the world or be it providing knowledge and information - technology has made science its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias life.
Our scientists have raised India proudly before the world
SRL has successfully launched 104 satellites in different countries simultaneously through mega mission, including the United States, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UAE and India.
India becomes the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together
And it is also a matter of great pleasure that this is a successful launch of the 38th PSLV
It is a historic achievement for the SCO, but for the whole of India.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is extremely important - Cartosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will help in mapping the photographs, resources, infrastructure, assessment of development and planning of urban development.
This new satellite cartosat 2 will help my farmer brothers and sisters especially in the country in terms of water resources and how they can be utilised.
Our satellite has sent some pictures as soon as we leave.
He has started his work
It is also a matter of great happiness for us that all these campaigns have been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such robust participation of youth and women is a very proud aspect in the success of ISR
I congratulate the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always maintained their objectives of bringing out space science for the common man, for the service of the nation and for the development of new records.
The less we congratulate these scientists and their entire team
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is about the security of India
India has achieved a great achievement.
This thing has not been discussed much yet, but Shobha ji's attention has gone to this important point.
This mission of interception technology, during its trial, struck the enemy's mission at a height of about 100 kilometres from the ground and made it a success.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security
And you will be glad to know that there are only four or five countries in the world who have mastered it.
When we see new technologies, there is a new scientific achievement then we are happy.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life .
And those who possess special intellect do not allow curiosity to remain a curiosity, they also question within it, they search for new inquiries and create new inquiries.
And that curiosity becomes the cause of new discovery
They do not sit quietly until they get the answer.
And if we observe the evolution journey of thousands of years of human life, we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Full stop is impossible
Efforts are constantly being made to know the universe, the laws of the universe, the minds of mankind.
New science, new technology arises from that.
And every technology, every new science form gives birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should draw attention to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Scientists of today cause a permanent change in the life of generations to come .
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major unity type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation was invited
Sometimes the problem also demonstrates the importance of science for solutions .
It means that there are a lot of people in this kind of role in the society and the country.
And our society is also becoming a technology driver.
Arrangements are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our life .
In the past, there is a huge force on Digi-Dhan
Gradually people are moving from cash to digital currency
Digital transactions are growing rapidly in India too.
In our country, Lucky Customer Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme has received huge support in the last few days.
It's almost two months since 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of happiness that so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, more than fifty thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
Under this scheme, more than 100 subscribers have received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh each.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received rewards of fifty thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in this thing and they are getting benefits.
When I asked him about his analysis, See, only youngsters come and even older people come, I am glad that among those who receive the prize, there are also 15-year-olds and even the elderly in the age group of sixty-five years.
Mr. Santosh ji from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on the NarendraModiApp that he got a reward of Rs.
Today they drive a car but in a way they have become an ambassador of this scheme.
All the travelers are given full time information about digital .
They keep talking with so much enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would urge the countrymen, the youth of the country, and the Lucky Client Plan, either the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, the reward they have received, that you yourself become an ambassador.
You should lead this movement.
Please take this forward and in a way this work has played a very important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, in my view, has a new anti-corruption card in the country.
In a way you are a soldier of purity.
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days will be completed.
April 14 is a celebration of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
On April 14, a very big price of crores of rupees is going to be drawn.
There are about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
It has just been the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
This time the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the BHIM.
And therefore I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundations laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to connect everybody at home and reach the BHIM App by adding it to 125 crore hands.
The impact of the movement that has been going on in the last two-three months is that several townships and villages have achieved great success in several cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today, I would like to tell you a lot of happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill up the stores of food grains.
The hard work of the farmers in our country has resulted in the production of record foodgrains this year.
All the signals are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time the crops in the fields have started flowing, like pongal and crutches have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is more than 8 more than the last record recorded in the names of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I would particularly like to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of my country listened to the voice of the poor and cultivated different pulses on nearly two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service to the poor people of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for one of my prayers, for the way the farmers of my country have worked hard on their heads and have produced record of pulses.
My dear countrymen, it keeps moving in this direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organizations and by everyone.
In a way, everyone is seen behaving awarely about cleanliness in some form or the other.
The Government is constantly striving to achieve this goal.
In the past, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, was held in Telangana.
And it is not just a seminar in the closed rooms of the state of Telangana but also by using the importance of direct sanitation.
On 17-18 February, a Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad.
He was cleaned by empty toilet pits of six houses and officials showed that pits used in twin pit toilets can be used again.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of this new technology are and there is no inconvenience in cleaning them, there is no hesitation, which is a psychological barrier, that too does not come in the way.
And we can clean the pits of a toilet in the same way as we do the normal cleaning.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has given importance to it and given importance to it.
If the ASEAN officers themselves clean the toilet pit then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And the toilet pits that you consider to be garbage, but if you look at them from the point of view of manure, then this is a black gold.
We can see what is wealth from waste.
And that ' s proved
One standard Twin Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected into the second pit.
In six-twelve months, pit waste gets completely decomposed.
It is very safe to handle decomposed waste and is very important from the fertilizer point of view NPK
The farmers are well familiar with NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassimum are rich in nutrients and is considered to be the best manure in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others must have done such experiments.
And now there is a special programme of Swachhta News in Doordarshan .
The more such things will be revealed in it, the more it will be beneficial.
Different departments in the government also celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada Regular.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, is going to strengthen the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these Ministries are also going to pursue cleanliness drive in the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, it increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Parallympics.
In the final of the Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan and glorified the country by becoming a world champion for the second consecutive time.
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I always believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every moment we can learn something from them
Whether it is a game or a space science - women in our country are not behind anybody
moving forward in footsteps and illuminating the name of the country with its achievements .
Our women sportspersons have won silver medals in the last few days.
My congratulations to all those players
March 8 Celebrates World Womens Day
In India too, giving importance to daughters, raising awareness about them in family and society, increased sensitivity
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao this movement is moving at a fast pace
Today it ' s not just a government program
It has become a campaign of social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common mansion, has forced people to think about this burning issue in every corner of the country and has brought about a change in the thinking of the people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
It gives so much joy when it comes to the news that the festival was celebrated on the birth of a daughter.
In a way positive thinking towards daughters is causing social acceptance .
I have heard that Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
District administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme and efforts are being made to ensure adoption and education of orphaned girls by the district administration along with organizing village councils.
Madhya Pradesh is running a campaign to educate every household girl child under the programme of knocking at every household.
Rajasthan has initiated a campaign to re-enroll the girls who had drop-out of their children, their school drive and motivate them to study again.
To say that Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has also taken many forms of this movement.
The whole movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
It has been diverted according to local needs .
You ' re also actively involved .
You get me a lot to know
What is happening on earth, what is happening in the minds of the poor, the poor reaches me.
I am grateful to you for your contribution.
Yesterday, Sri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated across India.
One can imagine the kind of personality that will be there after thousands of years, every festival brings innovation, brings new inspiration, brings new energy and thousands of years old life that can provide examples, inspiration, everybody can find solutions to the problems of Shri Krishna's life.
And that is why, today, when I am talking to you, I get the attention of two Mohans.
A Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, then the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan, leaving the banks of Yamuna, going to the coast of the sea in Gujarat, settled in the city of Dwarka and born on the coast of the sea, takes the last breath of life in Delhi, on the banks of Yamuna.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used his wisdom, his duties, his capabilities, his contemplation to avoid the war, thousands of years ago. And the Charkhadhari Mohan too chose such a path, for freedom, for the preservation of human values, for the preservation of personality - for this, he gave a turning point to the war of independence which is unique to the whole world.
Be it the importance of selfless service or be it the importance of knowledge or be it the importance of moving ahead smiling in the midst of all the ups and downs in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why it is also known as Sri Krishna, Jagatguru Krishna Vande Jagadguruma
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is being discussed not only in India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the farmers who were being discriminated against in Champaran, he served the mill workers who were not being paid proper wages, he considered the service of the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry as the ultimate duty of his life.
Whoever, whenever needed, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for the service.
He stressed not only on service but also on self-confidence associated with it.
The word ' Seva ' means that it should be done with joy : Seva Paramo Dharma :
But, at the same time, excellent joy, free dryness: the feeling of this spirit is also inherent in service.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and societies, humanity and humanity, all this was
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, everywhere, in a unique manner, he always emphasized on social development and community mobilization.
It has been my good fortune that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places associated with the venerable Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi Ji used to emphasise the organization's spirit with the spirit of service.
Community service and community mobilisation are the feelings that we have to bring in our practical life.
In true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true Karyanjali.
No countrymen
and collectivity has its own strength
Whether it is collective or serving the programmes of Gandhi 150
Our ladies are clubs
The work done by the ladies and clubs of the modern era will continue to be done. However, all the stakeholders of the ladies club will join hands with one or the other service.
can do a lot
I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore dreams and 130 crore initiatives.
There is no limit to what comes to the mind - just for goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and the service of a perfect dedication.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I had inaugurated a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The feelings raised in your mind will be more powerful than any great literary creation. And perhaps, in today's time, in your eyes, the form of a Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps even more relevant.
A lot of programmes, competitions and exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels was particularly interesting in this
You will remember that the Congress convention was held in Haripura, Gujarat where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential election was recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38 Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Kala Bhawan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase their art work during the session.
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose art work enhances the beauty of our Constitution .
gives a new identity to the constitution
And his art has immortalised the Constitution as well as Nand Lal Bose.
Nand Lal Bose visited village around Haripura and finally made some art canvas depicting the life of rural India
This precious artwork has been discussed tremendously .
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I expect every Indian to make some or some other resolution.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for someone else.
This will be a good, true, authentic work for Bapu
You will remember the sons of Mother Bharti that in the last few years, we have been running Swachhta Hi Seva campaign across the country for about two weeks prior to 2nd October.
This time it starts from 11th September .
During this time, we will leave our homes and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan.
Whether it is home or corridor, square or crossroads or drains, schools, colleges to run a massive campaign of cleanliness at all public places
Similarly, we have to work together to eliminate the use of Single Use Plastic.
This will save money and they will also be able to contribute to protecting the environment .
This time, on 2nd October, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate ourselves to open defecation free India but will also lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic across the country on that day.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal of plastic waste when all these plastic wastes are gathered.
It can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus till Diwali, we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhasitas are gems of knowledge in a way.
we can get what we want in life .
These days my contact has become very low , but earlier my contact was very much .
Stupid people call stones gems
In our culture , there is great glory of food .
Until We have transformed the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because it is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under POSHAN Abhiyaan, nutrition is being made a mass movement in modern scientific ways across the country.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes a thing was brought to my attention
In Nashik a handful of rice has become a big movement .
In this , Anganwadi workers collect a handful of grains from the people during harvesting days .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
In this the donor becomes an aware civil society worker .
After that he dedicates himself to this cause and becomes a soldier of that movement .
All of us have heard about food processing in every corner of India in families .
This ritual is performed when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Fixed food is not solid food
Gujarat thought in 2010 that children should be given complimentary food on the occasion of Anna Prashan Sanskar so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a very spectacular initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states people run Date Food Campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, there is a good day, there is a memorable day then the family members go to the anganwadi by cooking nutritious food and delicious food, go to schools and the family members serve children themselves.
share their joys and increase their joys .
There is a wonderful union of service and joy .
Friends, There are several small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, both the poor and the prosperous families are affected by malnutrition.
September to be celebrated as POSHAN Abhiyaan across the country
You must join it, get information, add some new ones, you also contribute
If you bring one or two people out of malnutrition means we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat , I was sure that a lot of questions would come about this matter and that too , in the last few weeks , wherever I met the people , there is a mention of Man vs . Hilld .
With this episode, I have joined not only the youth of India but also the youth of the world. I had never imagined that this will become my place in the young hearts.
I had never imagined how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to
I had never imagined that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people all over the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that whenever I got the opportunity to go as Prime Minister, and because of the International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that whenever I go to anyone in the world, some or some other five or seven minutes I ask me about Yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not talked to me about Yoga and I have experienced all over the world .
But these days there ' s a new experience
Whatever one gets, wherever he gets the opportunity to talk, he discusses about Wildlife, about environment.
Tiger, ion, creature and I wonder how much people are interested
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their language
I hope that in such a scenario, the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in the journey of Sanskrit, this episode of Discovery Channel will help the world in acquaintance with all these things. And now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But there is one more interesting thing. Some people hesitate to ask me one thing that Modi Ji tell me that you were speaking Hindi and Bear Grylls does not know Hindi, so how was Sawant happen between you so fast
What ' s it edited later
This has happened so many times. What has happened
with great curiosity .
Look, there's no secret in it.
Reality is that technology was used extensively in conversation with Bear Grylls
So I used to speak Hindi but he used to hear English and because of that dialogue became very easy and this is the wonder of technology
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife and nature.
I have said before, I must tell you to visit North-East in your life.
will extend within you
A country full of diversity will fill you with these diversities as a teacher, you as well as diversity from within.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
Tiger population in India is 2967
A few years ago half of that was hard to say
Tiger summit in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010 about tigers
It took a resolution expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world
It was a resolution to double the number of tigers worldwide by Twenty Two Two 2022.
We doubled the number of tigers in our country in 2019 itself .
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reservoirs has increased.
When I was releasing the Data Release of Tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir of Gujarat.
The habitat of lions was shrinking in the jungles of Gir when I took over the responsibility of Chief Minister there .
Their numbers were declining
We took several steps one after the other in Gir
In 2007, decided to deploy women guards
Improved infrastructure to enhance tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife only talk about conservation
But, now we have to go beyond conservation and think about compassion.
Our scriptures have also received very good guidance on this subject .
Therefore, we need not only to preserve our forests, flora and wildlife but also create an environment that will enable them to flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893 Eighteen Ninety Three
The young Sanyasis of India, who shook the human race all over the world, came out of the world with a stunning identity of India.
The words of the great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 forced the world to change the view of India towards the slave India which the world was looking at.
Come, the kind of India that Swami Vivekananda ji saw, Swami Vivekananda ji knew about the strength of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
For everybody, children, elderly, young, women, this will be a big interesting campaign and it will be your own.
But I ' m not going to tell you his nuances today .
I want to make you aware about it and also set some goals for the country for it India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on 29th August at It India.
Let us move ahead with a new zeal, new resolve and new energy.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet so much in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll wait for your suggestions,
Let us all come together to realise Gandhi's dreams to make India of the dreams of freedom fighters free:
Let ' s go while expressing the inner joy with service .
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On 26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, our commitment to democracy, is also a celebration of this ritual which makes the future generations aware about democracy, about democratic responsibilities and also enlightens them.
However, in our country, the debate on the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens should not be debated as deeply as it should be discussed in detail.
I hope that at every level, every time, as much force is given on the rights, the more emphasis is given on the duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties, the carriage of India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January. Our venerable Bapu is a sacred date.
On 30th January, we pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping their lives silent at 11 a.m.
As a society, as a country, a 2 minute tribute on January 30, 11 o'clock, this should be a comfortable nature.
Why not for 2 minutes, but it also expresses collectivity, determination and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is an instinctive feeling of respect towards the army, towards the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who have been honoured with various gallantry awards and their families.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal - many categories.
We are also surprised, we are proud and inspired when we know about their courage, valour and valour.
On the one hand, we were all happy with the news of the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of 26th January, at the same time, the soldiers of our army who are in the defence of the country in Kashmir got the bravery due to the avalanches.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I keep talking about my mind continuously.
January, February, March, April - all these months are the months of testing in every family.
There are 1 or 2 children in the house, but the entire family is under the burden of exam.
So I felt that this is the right time that I should talk to my student friends, talk to their teachers, because for many years, wherever I went, wherever I met, the examination was a big problem.
Family disturbed, student disturbed, teacher disturbed, a very strange psychological environment is seen in every household.
And I have always felt that I should come out of this and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in some detail.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this environment can not be happy
Well, the question is asked by the universe, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
We have worked hard for the past several years and now we have got the opportunity to tell that this festival should be such a festival of excitement.
There are very few people for whom there are pleasures in exams and for most of the people, exam is a presure.
You have to make a decision that you will consider it as a pleasure.
The person who will accept the pleasure, he will be regretful.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when the festival takes place, the best thing that happens within us comes out.
The strength of the society is also felt at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
There should also be an atmosphere of celebration in the entire family, among friends and neighbors.
You see, this pressure will be converted into pleasure.
The festive environment will make the burden free.
And I urge the parents to create an atmosphere of celebration for these three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these examinations are conducted for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months into festivals every year by taking into our tradition and by taking into consideration the environment of our families.
And you must have seen that when you are happy, when you smile, you get relaxed and when you are relaxed then you can easily remember the old things of your years.
A year ago, the entire scene is remembered what the teacher said in classroom.
And you must know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the field of relaxation.
If you are in tension then all the doors are closed, not inside, not outside.
There is a stoppage in the thought process and it becomes a burden in itself.
How did you remember outside You were the only one, no one told me.
But who was inside, immediately came out and came out because you became relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine for recall of memory then it is relaxation.
And I can say this thing with my own experience that if there is a pressure then we forget about our things and if we are relaxed then we can never imagine that such things are remembered and they are of great use.
But when the tension takes place then your knowledge, your knowledge and your information gets suppressed and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is necessary that A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we are unable to see the examination in the proper perspective.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
The exam you are going to give is the exam of your studies that you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you want to live, what kind of life you dont have any exam.
You must have had the opportunity to pass through many criteria in your life, in classrooms, in notebooks, except in the examination given.
Therefore, the examination has something to do with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burden.
They got admitted to the Air Force, Fail.
Suppose, if they were disappointed due to that failure, if they had lost their lives then would India not get such a big scientist, such a big president
The points have become the most important.
Because of this, competition has increased very much, along with the tension in the students has also increased greatly.
So I would like to be aware of your ideas on this present direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has answered, but Cha ji wants me to keep something in it too.
Marks and marks-sheets are a limited use.
That's not all in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have acquired.
Life goes on. Have you tried to live what you have to go
Life goes on. Is there any synergy between your mission and ambition that you have received a sense of mission
If you believe in these things, you will come after you by pressing the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
Knowledge is going to be useful in your life, skill is going to work, self-confidence is going to work, will power is going to work.
You tell me, there will be a doctor of your family and all the members of your family will visit him, they will have family doctors.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see that lawyer's marks-sheet
You see its experience, its knowledge and its success journey.
And that is why the burden of these numbers sometimes prevents us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that it is not just reading.
It must be used for your criterion.
I was yesterday, I said today, it's important to know.
But if you focus on the marks, you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to just get the marks.
So it may be that despite being promising in the Eam, sometimes life fails.
Cha ji, one thing has also said this competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Most of the successful sportspersons have a special feature in their lives that they compete.
If we take the example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years of continuous breaking of your record, defeating yourself every time and moving forward.
It is a wonderful life journey for him, because he adopted the path of competition more than competition.
Friends in every sphere of life and when you are going to give exam then if you were able to read for two hours in peace then can you do it for three hours
That energy is produced automatically from within.
If you are better, you will become irresponsible, you will be filled with a lot of faith.
You will be disappointed and disappointed and filled with jealousy. The jealousy that you, yourself, will eat and if you are equal, you will never realize the need for improvement.
Just concentrate on how to do it ahead of what I had done.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not educated, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you will learn to accept it, the maximum problem will be eliminated.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
Expectations make the road difficult.
Accepting the situation gives an opportunity to open new paths and therefore accept what is there.
You will also be burden free.
One of our familiar individuals was in the hospital due to heart attack. The first speaker of our Lok Sabha, Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, who was once MP, came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask a single question about his health by coming.
As soon as they sat there, what is the situation, what is the disease, no talk, no jokes, and in the first two-four minutes, they made such an environment lighter.
In a way, going to a sick person, we are scared of illness.
I would like to tell the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought of giving children an environment of laughter and happiness in the days of Eam
You see, the environment will change.
A wonderful phone call has come to me.
They do not want to name their gentleman.
Listening to the phone, you will know why they don't want to tell their names
Hello, Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I had done something like this in my childhood.
I had tried to copy once in my childhood, I started preparing a lot for that. I tried to find out the ways and means of copying, due to which a lot of time was wasted.
In that time I could bring the same number by reading as I spent my mind trying to imitate.
And when I tried to copy and pass, I was caught and because of me many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut roads become a reason for copying.
Copy never benefits.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard several times and again that don't copy, don't copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once there was a habit of copying, there would never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you be able to reach
And if the same creativity, if you give the same time on the issues of your exam then perhaps there is no need for copying.
The self-confidence that will be achieved by the hard work of your own will be amazing.
This fundamental assumption is wrong, the root cause of the problem is that.
To develop holistically, there is a life outside books and it is very huge.
This is the time for him to learn to live.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later, I will do it later, it is impossible.
Have you ever imagined that when there is so much in front of you then take a two-minute exit and look at the trees and plants, lighten your mind and see that you will come back in your room, in your books again with a freshness.
Whatever you are doing, take a little break, get up and go out, go out in kitchen, find something of your choice, if you get a biscuit of your choice then eat a little bit and make fun of it.
Whether it's five minutes or not, but you give a break.
You will feel that your work is becoming simple.
Whether everyone likes it or not, I do not know it, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to take a deep breath.
You can see that the body will be relaxed one by one and the relaxation that you dont feel in the body or in the same way relaxes the body parts.
When I hold meetings in the elections, sometimes my voice gets sat down.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No, no, say - this is your voice that gets disturbed by speaking at the time of election, it is related to it.
You will take full sleep only then your vocational card will get full rest.
Now I had never thought of sleeping and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the significance of these things, you see, it will benefit you.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said that now there is no need to wake up, we have to keep sleeping.
So don't do this, otherwise your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on the day you will not see them, I will show them.
So don't do that.
And that is why I would like to say that P for Prepared and P or Play, the person who plays, who plays, who plays, who plays, who plays, is a very big medicine to keep him cautious.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the exam and I'm holding you in my mind.
Perhaps this thing of today will also work for you people.
If you can do it, if you cant, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So as I advise the parents of your family not to be a burden, they also apply to me.
Make the criterion a celebration to overcome every criterion.
Then there will be no criterion, criterion.
Please move ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that Coast Guard has made its place among the world's 4 largest Coast Guard with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in the country.
In pursuance of this motto, the Coast Guard personnel are eager to preserve the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country in adverse conditions.
And very few people would be aware that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country but also women who are doing their duty equally on their shoulders and are successfully performing it.
Our women officers of Coast Guard, officers of Pilots, bservers, not only this, they also take charge of overcraft.
It is considered an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color is Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the people of our country on this auspicious festival of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, All India Radio in Mann Ki Baat always keeps on coloring with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to the mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
It has received extensive acceptance.
People are writing letters from far and wide.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
Talk of mind, December 2016
However, you must have seen in the newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being conducted, good people are being caught and how is this possible

Rahul played 199 runs. Test captain Virat Kohli gave a good batting as well as a good leadership.
Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border with China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but this Diwali experience was something else.
25 billion Indians of the country dedicated it to the soldiers of the Diwali army, dedicated it to the security forces, its impact was reflected on the faces of every soldier there.
He looked full of emotions and not only this, the good wishes and messages sent by the people of the country, the security forces of the country were included in their happiness, it was a wonderful response.
And people had just sent messengers. It was not like that.
Someone wrote poems, someone made pictures, someone made cartoons, someone made videos, i.e. not knowing every house became a post of fighters.
The work is going on, the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country and your imagination towards the security forces of the country will be compiled in this book.
A soldier wrote to me - "Prime Minister, for our soldiers, Holi is on the border, Diwali is always immersed in the security of the country.
Yeah, still remembers the house at the time of festivals.
But to tell the truth, this time it didn't seem like this
It's not Weel that there's a festival and I'm not home
It was felt as if we were celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feeling that this Diwali, the feeling that has awakened between the security forces of our country and the soldiers in this environment, should it be limited to just a few occasions
I appeal to you that we must remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other, whatever festivals, festivals and atmosphere of joy, whatever manner we make our nature, as a society, as a nation, as a nation.
When the whole nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Just a while ago, I had come to meet all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
I had the opportunity to talk to him for a long time .
They had come up with some ideas for the development of their villages and had brought some demands. But when there was a time of discussion then it was natural that the situation of the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children, all these things were very natural to get out.
And with so much love and openness these village princes spoke and said that everything was going to touch my heart.
I had urged them to go and focus their attention on the future of these children .
Today I am glad that all these Prime Ministers who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise made to me.
went to the village and awakened the people far away
Just a few days ago, when the Board's exam took place, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the Board examination of about 95, Pachanabe Fee Kashmir.
Joining such a large number of students in the Board exams indicates that our children from Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm but I heartily congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the Gram Pradhans.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that all suggestions came in one way.
Everyone used to say that more on notes with 500- and 1000 - talk in detail
Well, while addressing the nation at 8:00 pm on 8th November, I had discussed the launch of a massive campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But as important as the decision is, the decision is to be implemented.
And I was also supposed to have to face many new difficulties in our normal life .
And even then I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal state.
The campaign to get rid of the diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years cannot be simple.
I can understand your difficulties very well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
You have understood this path of truth very well, you have accepted this point of national interest very well despite a lot of efforts being made to mislead you.
The entire world is closely watching this decision. Everybody is analysing it and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that the 125 crore Indians will succeed even after facing difficulties
There may be a question mark in the world's mind
It is only reverence and belief that 1. 25 billion Indians will keep fulfilling their resolutions.
And our country will come out of all the ways of penance like gold. And the reason for this thing is that you people are the citizens of this country and this way of success is also possible because of you people.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh friends are engaged in this work day and night with dedication.
In the midst of a lot of tensions, all these people are working very quietly, considering it as a sacrifice for the service of the nation and as a great effort for transformation.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, it does not even know, but all are
And because of that India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible
And I've seen that in the midst of so many difficulties, all the people of the bank, the post office are working
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an elderly man in Khandwa had become an accident
Suddenly money was needed
And I am glad to know that he should go to his house, the elderly so that he can help in the treatment.
Innumerable stories emerge every day in the TV, in the media, in newspapers, in conversations.
Their strength was realized .
Today, once again, he has taken up this challenge and I am confident that the resolutions of 1. 25 billion Indians will be fulfilled by making this nation a new force.
But the evils are so widespread that even today some people do not have a habit of evil .
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, this benami money, some other way, I will bring it back to the system.
They're looking for unlawful ways to save their money.
Sadly , in this also they prefer to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money into their accounts or doing something from them.
But, please don't play with the lives of the poor
Don't do anything that brings the name of the poor to the record and when it is checked, my beloved poor will be in trouble due to your sin.
And the Anonymous property has been made so stringent that it is being implemented, how difficult it will be
And the government doesn ' t want our countrymen to face any difficulty
Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has telephoned and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money that has been waged through this five hundred and a thousand: Sir Namaste, My name is Ashish Pare.
I am a common citizen of Village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
The money you have closed for thousands or five hundred notes is very commendable.
A similar telephone call has come to me from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District in Karnataka.
I want to thank you sincerely because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and a thousand notes, seeing all this taught a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have a better day
That's why I want to thank you very much .
Some things get to know through the media, through the medium of people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working becomes very high.
It is so enjoyable, so proud that what a wonderful capability of the common man in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass there again, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, sacrifice and honesty.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, marriage also happens.
I came to know that on November 17, at Surat, there was a marriage that took place with discussions on marriage tea.
In Surat, in Gujarat, a daughter came to Surat to feed the people who had come to their wedding and did not feed them any food programme.
Baratis also respected him so much
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - they have contributed in the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage. This is an inspiration for themselves.
I also convey my best wishes to Navparineet Bharat and Daksha and congratulate them for converting the occasion of marriage into this great sacrifice and turning it into a new occasion.
Tea-workers live and Tea-worker get weekly money
Now a note of Rs 2000 was received, what did they do
The women from four neighborhoods gathered together and all the four went to buy and paid a note of Rs 2,000 because they did not need a small currency because they bought it together and decided that they will get it for the next week.
People are searching for ways by themselves
See, how the life of the village is changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign .
The country will get the benefit in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipality hardly gets 50 of ta .
But this time due to the 8th decision everybody ran to deposit their old notes
47 urban units had a tax of about Rs 3,500 crore last year.
You will be surprised to know, it will also be a pleasure.
Said three to three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And they also came from the front
Now if this money has come 4 times in that municipality then it is natural that there will be arrangements for gutters in the poor settlements, water will be provided and Anganwadi will be provided.
There are many such examples in which its direct benefits are also being seen.
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmer is a strong pivot of our country's economy.
On the one hand, every citizen is adjusting himself due to this new change of economy and difficulties.
But I would like to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today.
Right now I was taking the sowing figures of this crop
I am glad, be it wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I had an account of the 20th of November, sowing has increased significantly in comparison to the previous year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmer has discovered ways.
The government has also taken several important decisions, which have given priority to farmers and villages.
Even after that there are difficulties but I believe that the farmer who stands stubborn despite all our difficulties and natural difficulties, still stands stubborn.
Small traders of our country, they also provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions of crores of rupees were given to such small people under the Mudra Yojana because these small businesses, millions of people do it and speed up the trade of billions and billions of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have difficulty due to this decision .
But I have seen that now these small traders of ours are also serving the customers in their own way through technology, through Mobile App, through Credit Card, through Mobile Bank.
And I want to tell my small businessmen brothers and sisters that there is a chance that you also enter the digital world.
You also download banks on your mobile phone
You also have a PSL machine for a credit card
I invite you that you can contribute immensely in creating a cashless society, you can create a complete banking system in your business, in your mobile phones and today there are many ways other than notes so that we can run the business.
There are technological paths, safe, secure and quick
I would like you to just help in achieving this mission. Not only this, you also lead the transformation and I believe you can lead the transformation.
I want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have been exploited.
There is a wage on the paper and when given in the hand, the second is
Whenever a salary is paid, someone stands outside, he has to pay his due and labour forcefully makes this exploitation a part of his life.
With this new system, we want your bank account, your salary money to be deposited in your bank so that Minimum Wags are followed.
And once the money has come to your bank account then you too dont have to buy a small mobile phone or a big smart phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-bootwear - you can also pay the money from the same mobile phone whichever you want to buy in a small shop in neighborhood.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become partners in this scheme because after all I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmer, for the labourers, for the deprived section of the society and for the victims.
Today I particularly want to talk to young friends
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 population below 35 years of age.
You, the young and the young women of my country, I know that you liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you contribute a lot to this thing positively .
But friends, you're my true soldier, you're my true companion
A wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharti has come to our forefront.
My young men, can you help me
You're not going to talk to me so much.
As much as you have experience of todays world, not the older generation.
Perhaps the elder brother of your family would not even know. And the parents, uncles and aunts, maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what happens to App, you know what happens online banking, you know, how online ticket booking happens.
For you things are very common and you also use them .
But the great work that the country wants to do today is our dream cashless society.
It is true that 100 percent cashless society is not possible
And I want your physical help, yourself's time, yourself's resolve and you will never disappoint me, I am sure that all of us are those who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, how many opportunities are there today for cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking
Every bank provides online facility
Wallet means e-Batua
There are many types of cards available
There can be cash transfer from the ordinary daily phone.
Whether it is a washerman, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller, a gram seller, everyone can easily use it.
And I have also emphasized to make this system more simpler .
All banks are engaged on it, doing it
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation who is unfamiliar with it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great work.
The kind of creative message you give on the WhatsApp - slogan, poems, tales, cartoons, new imagination, laughter - I can see everything and amidst the challenges this is the creative power of our younger generation, it seems as if this is the speciality of the land of India that the Gita was born in the battleground in some time, just as we are passing through such a period of massive change, then the original creativity inside you is also becoming visible.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I want your help. And you, I believe that millions of youngsters of my country will do this thing.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You voluntarily have this cashless society, the great campaign to get rid of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to get rid of difficulties and problems - you have to lead this campaign.
Once you will teach people how to use Rupay Card, the poor will bless you.
If you teach the common man these facilities then perhaps he will get rid of all the worries. And if all the youngsters of India are engaged in this work then I dont believe that it will take longer.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern India and you can do this through your mobile phones, you can do it by going to 10 houses daily, by adding 10 houses in it everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, has been moving ahead with the cleanliness drive.
It looks as if the topic of cleanliness has spread in his veins and that is why he also remembered the work of cleanliness on his fathers birth anniversary.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and one of his lines he has written: the body of the soil, the mind of the fun, the life of the moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through it.
The soil of the soil, the mind of the fun, the life of the moment, the introduction of me, the son of Amitabh Ji, whose veins are running the mission of cleanliness, he has written to me, using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My introduction
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai ji
I also thank Mr. Amitabh ji for connecting in Mann Ki Baat and for pursuing the cause of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings keep me continuously connected to you through your letters, on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all for Diwali.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and excitement in every corner of India.
India is a country that witnesses 365 days of celebration in every corner of the country.
The person who looks from afar will feel that this is the second name of the festival like Indian life and it is also natural.
Festivals that have been in India since the Vedas till date have been time-bound celebrations, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of outdated festivals and changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the need of the hour and society.
However, we can clearly see that this entire journey of India's festivals, its expansion, its depth, its penetration among the people, its penetration and its penetration are related to a fundamental mantra.
Efforts should be made to expand individuals and individuals, to expand the scope of our limited thinking, from society to the universe and to do it through festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have embraced the festival in a scientific manner.
Today, the entire world is talking about environment.
Nature-destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been going to strengthen the tradition of nature-loving, from a child to every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everyone has a feeling of responsibility.
Nowadays, we celebrate Sunday, however, you must have seen that for centuries we had a tradition of celebrating the festival of full moon and new moon.
That is, the tradition of celebrating our holidays with the universe and science was developed.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is educative, it brings a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya - from darkness to light.
By burning the lamp of Deepawali, the darkness of the society, the darkness of the person, the darkness of the person, the salvation of the darkness, and that is the festival of lighting the lamp of Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, let us go to any corner of the country, let us go to the houses of the rich and the poor, let us go to the cottages of the poorest of the poor, let us see the cleanliness drive in every family during Diwali festival.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The poor will be their pottery, so the pottery also cleans like this, just like Diwali has come.
Diwali is also a cleanliness drive.
But, the need of the hour is not only to clean the houses but also to clean the entire premises, to clean the entire area, to clean the entire village and to enlarge our nature and traditions.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is remembered and celebrated in some form or the other.
Several governments of the world are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
He has shared that picture with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what's the picture
16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside Parliament wearing Indian saris and have become photo viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of New Dealand had just arrived, he told me that I have to go back soon because I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light, this festival of light is also becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
They invite a very big accident in an attempt to make a big voice by collecting many firecrackers.
Never remember that there are things around, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, the news of the accident, the news of the fire, the news of the death, causes great concern.
And one of the troubles is that in the days of Diwali, even a large number of doctors had gone to celebrate Diwali with their families.
It's not just one day.
If you call Govardhan Pooja, say Bhai Duj, say Benefits Panchami, and take it to the Prakash Parv of Kartik Purnima, then in a way a long period of time runs.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath-Puja is a big festival in the eastern part of India.
In a way, there is a great festival, it runs for four days, but it has a special feature - it gives a very deep message to the society.
But the proverb is that Bhai, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the rising sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali, Chhath Puja - this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you but at the same time I have more time to thank and thank the people of my country, I would like to express my gratitude.
For the past few months, the events that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness and well-being.
My feelings and feelings are shadowed by the army personnel, the soldiers of the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work and my heart and mind.
And one of the same thing was done in mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen to Sandesh to Soldiers for a campaign.
But today I want to bow down my head and say that there will not be any such person in India whose heart is the pride of the army, its pride for the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine the security forces. Your message has emerged as a force.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a poor, a trader, a shopkeeper, a politician, a sportsperson or a cinema, there is hardly anyone left who has not given up for the soldiers of the country or for the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed this festival in an opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not, be it BSF or CRPF, IISc.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, Water-Army, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, I cannot utter the names of all.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, a new energy comes in that memory too.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country has shown tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did it through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers, so many things and so many things have come on this washtag in a symbolic way.
I would like to read a poem by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am glad, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am glad, I smile, all this is because, you are, I tell you today, the reason for my freedom is because of you, the reason for happiness, I sleep peacefully because, because you are deployed on the outskirts, the glass of the mountain Amber and the glass of India, the glass of the glass bending you, the glass of the mountain and the glass of India bend you, the glass of the mountain and the glass of India and the glass of you, in the same way the army is mine, in the same way, the bowels of the army are mine and mine.
My dear countrymen, whose maternal grandmother is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws too are full of army personnel, such a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Let us hear what the army family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign launched on this Diwali.
I'm from an army family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and father-in-law have been both Army Officers.
So we are full of family soldiers and there are several officers on the border who are receiving such good messages and are getting a lot of encouragement.
And I would like to say that along with Army Officers and Soldiers their families and their wives also do a lot of sacrificies.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found not only on the border but on every front of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was open defecation free and open defecation free.
Earlier Sikkim was the province, now it is Himachal, it is going to be Kerala on 1st November.
The TBP personnel, Shri Vikas Thakur are originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So at that time he was going to have a village council at that time and he was going to visit that village and it was being discussed in the village meeting and it was found that some families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is one of our patriotic initiatives.
And that is why Himachal Pradesh has got the power to make Open Defecation Free.
Similarly, in Kerala, I would like to express my gratitude to the youngsters.
I came to my notice that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no way, after walking on foot all day long, that village can hardly be reached. Such a tribal panchayat, Idmalakudi, is also difficult to reach.
People never go.
Nearby, in the urban areas, the students of Engineering came to know that toilets are being constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS people, engineering students, all of them together decided that we will construct toilets.
All the goods, bricks, cement, all the things that were required to be constructed for the construction of toilets were picked up by these youngsters on their shoulders and walked on foot in those forests throughout the day.
Work is going on in all the states at a very fast pace.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken up this task, the entire state, I am confident that the Kerosene will be free soon.
Our foreign exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, if there's a problem, the middlemen will be, the dishonest ones will.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
All their things should be said in the country even today, how to go, the standard sets for them.
You decide on this standard.
The need of the hour is that now the aspirations of the poor people of the country will have to be addressed.
We will have to take one step after another to get rid of the difficulties.
Whatever our old thinking is, but society must be freed from the distinction between son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools and also toilets for children.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to experience a discriminatory India.
Even though there is vaccination on behalf of the government, lakhs of children are left out of immunization and become victims of disease.
Mission Indradhanush is a mission to vaccinate even the deprived children, which empowers children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the health of the poor mothers and the smoke of 400 cigarettes in a day by cooking food on a wooden stove
We are trying to provide smoke-free lives to 5 crore families and we are moving towards success.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, barber shopkeepers and moneylenders used to get stuck in the interest of the moneylenders.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand Up Scheme, Jan Dhan account are a successful mission of emancipation of interest holders.
Depositing money directly into banks through Aadhaar, the beneficiary gets money directly.
This is an opportunity to get rid of middlemen in the lives of common man.
There is a campaign to run, in which not only reforms and changes, but the path to liberation from the problem is to be ensured and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October is the festival of birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, who had made the mantra of India's unity as the mantra of his life.
However, the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain and suffering also touched me: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking to Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, it is Sardar Patel's birthday on 31st.
And as we all know how events have taken place in the country after their assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that we can stop such unfortunate events and events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is witness to the fact that after Chanakya, Bhagirath work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Successful efforts to bring freedom to India under one flag, the great man who had done such a great work, bowed down to that great man for centuries.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, due to his priorities of unity struggled for unity, he was also a victim of indignation of many, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lived his life for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, injustice to the Sardars, a page of history pains us all.
But, in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
We should also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendency, save the country too.
Sardar Saheb gave us Ek Bharat, it is our responsibility to make Shreshtha Bharat.
The basic mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The journey of Sardar Saheb's life began with the struggle of the farmers.
The son of the farmer was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful attempt to transform the freedom movement into a force in the village was the result of his organisational strength and skill.
But Sardar Saheb was just a man of struggle, not so, he was also a man of structure.
Today, sometimes we hear the name of Amul.
Today people are also familiar with every product of Amul outside India and India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine vision that he had imagined the unity of cooperative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima in this series of Diwali is also a festival of Prakash Utsav.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and teachings are a guide not only for the entire mankind, but also for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and Sarbat da Bhala, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the original mantra of peace, unity and goodwill.
The campaign to liberate the society from discrimination, superstitions and evils was in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Lalo as his colleague when we were at the peak of the untouchables, caste and creed.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to quit discrimination, orders us to do something against discrimination, if we want to move ahead with this mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas then who can be a better guide than Guru Nanak Dev
I bow down to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, this Light Festival is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to you all on Diwali in the name of the soldiers of the country.
Your dreams, your resolutions should succeed in every possible way.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that your life becomes a life of happiness and happiness.
Thanks a lot.
In the last few days, in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay tribute to them.
And that is why I would say this thing to the countrymen today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day that I will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we trust our army.
We are proud of our army.
Today, I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in particular.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national forces well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have separated themselves from such elements and have walked on the path of peace.
Every parent wishes that the school-college work fully as soon as possible.
Farmers are also feeling that the crops and fruits that have been produced should reach the markets across the country.
Economic business also runs properly.
And for the past few days, the business has started functioning smoothly.
Peace, unity and goodwill are also the way to solve our problems, our path of progress and our path of development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I believe that we will find solutions to every problem by meeting and finding ways and also paving the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of governance.
To make laws and order, the government has to take some steps.
Sometimes people think differently from what we think.
In social media these days, I get the opportunity to know a lot.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to understand the feelings and feelings of all kinds of people and it promotes the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshavardhana of class 11th class put a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very disturbed.
But there was no way to do it and what a small student like me could do.
So I came to my mind as to how I should work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I will study for 3 hours a day.
I will be able to work for the country, I will be a worthy citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of anger, at such a young age, you can think of health. This is a matter of great happiness for me.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the resentment that is in the minds of the citizens of the country has a great value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this emotional world of the country in a very good way.
And he inspired the common man of the country to work for the country by giving Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra.
There is another way to express patriotism in the midst of the sounds of bombs and guns for every citizen. Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had presented this thing.
Even Mahatma Gandhi used to make very successful experiments to inspire the intensity of the movement and to motivate the intensity of the movement towards creative work within the society.
All of us should fulfill our responsibilities, the people sitting in the government should do their duty. And if we make any constructive contribution along with the countrymen, every citizen, this patriotism, then the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on the NarendraModiApp that the thletes that had visited the Paralympics created history and their performance was the victory of human spirit.
Varun Viswanathan also wrote on the NarendraModiApp that our footlets have done a very good job and you should mention it in the matter of mind.
Not two of you, every person of the country has got an emotional attachment towards our players in the paralympics.
Perhaps even more than that, this paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the attitude of humanity, of looking at Divyang.
And I will never forget this story of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he got the medal, he said that with this medal I have defeated the disability.
This sentence has great power.
This time, 19 athletes including 3 women from our country participated in the Paralympics.
When Divyang plays in comparison to the rest of the sports, physical ability, skills of sports, this is the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals while performing the best so far - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medal.
Debendra Jhajharia, the recipient of the gold medal, brought the gold medal again in the spear throw and brought it back after 12 years.
And they were not Divya from birth.
They had to lose one hand because of the electric current.
Just imagine, the person who receives the first gold medal at the age of 23 and at the age of 35 gets the second gold medal, how much hard he has done in his life.
Mariyappan won the gold medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right foot at the age of 5.
The poor also did not come in the way of their resolve.
Neither are they from a big city nor from a middle class rich family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country got medals with the capability of resolution.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, many kinds of winners have been associated with his name.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in a high jump.
In our country, in our society, in our neighborhood and in our neighborhood, these medals have done a great job to look at the medals and medals of paralympics.
Our sensibilities have been awakened, but the attitude of looking at these people with disabilities has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of the fact that the people with disabilities have achieved success in this time paralympics.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition at the same place.
Anyone can imagine that the record of General Olympics has been broken by the people of Divyang.
This time it has happened.
The record that was created by the gold medal winner in the 1500 meter race, Algeria's Abdellati Baka created a new record in the race of 1. 7 seconds, 1500 meters.
Moreover, I was surprised that the number of persons with disabilities, whose number came in the runnership, did not get any medal in the runnership, had run in less than the time of receiving gold medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth plan for the Parallympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had wonderful experiences in Navsari of Gujarat.
He told me some excerpts, and I presented them to the people, so people were surprised.
On that day, I had the opportunity to dedicate a book, which he had collected successful stories of the lives of some disabled persons.
There were big motivational incidents.
The Government of India has recorded a world record on the soil of Navsari, which I consider important.
Within eight hours, six-hundred-half persons with disabilities were successfully used to feed machines to listen to those who could not hear.
He was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for the countrymen to have a three-three world record by the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, every citizen should become a duty and an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt should be created.
Now, on 2nd October, when we are completing two years, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everyone has tried to move forward.
It means that the country has moved towards 100 million steps, cleanliness.
And that is why everybody, whether it is a common citizen, whether it is a government office or a road, be it a bus or rail, be it a religious place or be it a school or a college or be it a religious place, be it a hospital or be it a hospital or be it an old man or a village poor or a farmer woman, everybody is contributing something or the other in cleanliness.
Friends of Media have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, the efforts have been sufficient and we will succeed. This belief has also been born.
And that is why if we talk about rural India then so far about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and 1. 5 crore more toilets have been constructed in the coming one year.
When I went to Gujarat, I was told by the officials that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, congratulations to those who are trying to do it and I urge the countrymen to respect their mothers and sisters, to make the country free from this problem, let us take a pledge and move forward.
In particular, I would like to present a scheme for the young friends who use technology in abundance.
Everyone has the right to know about the cleanliness mission in your city and the government of India has given a telephone number for this - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
We celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi in 1969 and will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
You will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in your city but will also be able to apply for the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also appellated the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor such young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Wellows.
This cleanliness drive is not limited to just rituals.
Cleanliness is not enough.
In today's era, health is linked with cleanliness. Revenue model is also essential along with cleanliness.
It is also necessary to be a part of it and therefore we have to move forward in the direction of Swachhta Mission as well as in the direction of East to Compost.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost that is produced from the waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming will be provided this thing.
Those who want to improve their soil health, those who are concerned about the health of the soil, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizer, if they need some kind of fertilizer then they should provide them.
And Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors of metropolitan cities, Commissioners, all these things are going to contemplate on cleanliness alone.
What could happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I can see that there are fresh news reports for cleanliness.
One day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started Jagaran Abhiyan for the construction of toilets.
He worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets.
You must have seen that in the past, a team led by the Commander Paramveer Singh swimmed 2800 kilometers from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar in Ganga and conveyed the message of cleanliness.
The government of India has also made its own departments a year-long calendar.
Every department focuses on hygiene for 15 days in particular.
In the coming month of October from 1st to 15th October, all three of them are going to work together to make a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of the month of October, from October 16 to October 31, three more department agriculture and farming - the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the Food Processing Industries (DPI) and the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DAFW).
My citizens are also requested to join in the work that is being done by these departments.
You must have seen that a survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on these days.
Earlier, the situation of cleanliness was presented to the people of the country by surveillance of 73 cities.
Now it is the turn of those cities with a population of more than 1 lakh, which are nearly 500 and due to this every city has a belief that lets go, brothers, we are left behind, we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of cleanliness competition.
I hope all the citizens can contribute in this campaign as much as they can.
The coming 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
2 years of Swachh Bharat Mission.
I always insist on buying something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge every family to have some kind of khadi so that Diwali can be burnt in the houses of the poor.
On October 2, when it is Sunday, as a citizen, can we join ourselves in cleanliness somewhere
2 hours and 4 hours physically please associate yourself with cleanliness and I would like to tell you to share one photo of your cleanliness drive with me on NarendraModiApp.
If you have a video, share a video.
See, with the efforts of the people all over the country, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new momentum.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we should pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a sense of joy in your lives, whether someone recognises it or not.
Their campaign is to collect and deliver the food items, clothing to the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and they used to donate the old toys and those toys used to visit the Anganwadis of the poor settlements.
This donation is a kind of festival.
I convey my best wishes to the youth who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, this is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji and the centenary year of his birth is beginning from today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitaya-Sarvajan Sukhaya Antyodaya - has been their contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor get the fruits of development
He presented the entire economic agenda in two words, water to every hand and every farm.
The country celebrated her birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
The focus of the society, governments, everyones attention, the benefits of development should be focussed on how the poor can get the benefits of development and only then can we free the country from poverty.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the same century.
I respectfully bow down to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, the wealthy devotee of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, I had started the Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
It was my authentic effort that this talk of mind should not be a program to praise government work.
How does the common man of this country continue to inspire me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way you have appreciated Mann Ki Baat today, the way you have showered your blessings and blessings.
I am also grateful to All India Radio for not only broadcasting these things but also making every effort to reach them in all languages.
I also express my gratitude to the countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat and knocked down the government doors by suggesting suggestions and highlighted the shortcomings of the government.
So Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue but a new opportunity for socio-economic transformation.
What can be the reason for this greater satisfaction for anyone and therefore I thank and thank everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja next week, the festival of Vijaya Dashami, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way a different atmosphere prevails across the country.
This is the festival of Shakti-Upasana, the unity of the society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can this festival of worship of Shakti be celebrated as a festival of unity of society
How did the festival connecting people
And that is the true power and only then can we celebrate the victory by doing it together.
Come, let us practice Shakti, let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of Hockey Magician Dhyan Chand Ji on 29th August.
This day is celebrated throughout the country as National Sports Day.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I also want to remind all of you of his contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, in the Olympic Games, he played an important role in conferring the Gold Medal of Hockey Hockey to India.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked Dhyan Chand ji - We scores goals like runs. Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hit Hockey on the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
There was only 10 minutes left to end the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three goals in those 10 minutes and said that I gave revenge for the injury to the goal.
My dear countrymen, whenever it comes to Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I am seeing this thing very positively that the common man has so much attachment to Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something on it.
There is so much love for Indian citizens and sports outside of cricket, so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, this too became a source of great inspiration in itself.
A Mr. Ajit Singh has written on the NarendraModiApp. Please speak this time about the daughters education and their participation in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
Some Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention the mention of Indus, Witness and Deepa Karmakar in this time mind.
The medals we received, the daughters gave it.
Our daughters once again proved that they are in no way less than anyone.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do even better in lympics.
He has written: Congratulations to the two medals we won in Rio first.
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to make a long walk in sports.
Our parents still stress on studying and focusing on academics.
The game is still considered to be a waste of time in society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And no one can do this well with you.
One such person, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on the NarendraModiApp that there is a need to focus on etra-curricular activities especially by taking up sports for children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling in a way.
It can not be denied that we could not perform according to our hopes.
In some cases, it happened that our sportspersons who performed in India, the sportspersons who performed here did not even reach there and they got only two medals in the medal table.
But it is also true that in spite of not getting the medal, if you look at it carefully, then for the first time in many subjects, Indian sportspersons have shown a lot of good feat.
Now look, in Shooting, our innovative Bindra ji was in fourth place and he missed the medal in a very short span.
Deepa Karmakar had also done wonders in Gymnastics - she was in fourth place and missed medal due to a slight difference.
But how can we forget one thing that she is the first Indian daughter to do uality for lympics and lympic finals
Something similar happened with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in tennis.
We have performed well in athletics this time.
After P. T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar had done a qualifying service for track field finals.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached the lympics.
Krishna Yadav reached the uarter-Final in Bong but could not get Bronze.
Many players, such as Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das, have many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do the same, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The government of India will go into its depth in housing and will study what are the practices happening in the world.
We will make a roadmap of what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a far-reaching thinking.
I also urge the state governments to create such committees and what can we do in the field of sports, what can each state do, what can the state choose one sport or two sports
And I urge every citizen of India to send suggestions on NarendraModiApp for those who are interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss the Association and give it to the government.
State Governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is Teachers Day.
I used to learn a lot from these small children too.
For me, on 5th September was Teachers' Day and for me, it was Education Day too.
But this time I have to go for a G-20 summit, so I realized that today I will express my feelings and feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
As much as the mother's place in life, the teacher's place is the same.
And we have seen such teachers who are more concerned about themselves.
He spends his life for his disciples, for his students.
These days after Rio Olympics, there is talk of Pullela Gopichand ji all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher than a sportsperson.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teacher's contribution to all of us is always felt.
5th September is the birthday of the former President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates him as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live himself as a teacher.
I also sometimes think that I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our ero in our small villages.
But today I can say this thing with happiness that one of my teachers is now 90 years old - even today I receive a letter from him every month.
And even at the age of 90, his handwriting is still surprising that he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad because whenever I see somebody's good letters, I feel very much respected.
You must share your photographs with your teacher on the NarendraModiApp, an incident with your teacher, an inspiring thing of your teacher.
See, seeing the contribution of teachers in the country from the viewpoint of the students, this too is very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is going to be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is an obstacle and we all want our country, our society, our family, our every individual and his life to be smooth.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival then it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav - this is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Utsav, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening, a festival of social rituals.
And, through the public Ganesh Utsav, there should be a wide range of discussions about the questions that touch the society and the lives of the people, such programmes should be created so that the society gets a new energy and a new momentum.
Even today, not just Maharashtra, but in every corner of India, public Ganesh festivals have started.
All the youngsters make a lot of preparations to do this and there is a lot of enthusiasm too.
And some people have still tried their best to follow the spirit of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They keep discussions on public topics, essay competitions, rangoli competitions.
They also highlight the issues that touch the society in a artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birthright.
Suraj should be our priority, can not we send messages from the public Ganesh festival regarding this mantra
Let me invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of society.
The festival fills new lives in the life of individuals and society.
Life is impossible without festivities but it has to be moulded according to the need of the hour.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot especially on Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
And they are worried about the environment.
And some of them are Shriman Shankar Narayana Pacific, he has urged them not to use the idols of Ganesh ji made of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil from the village pond
The images made of POP are not environmentally friendly.
They have expressed great pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why not come back to the old tradition of Ganesha idols, Durga idols using soil.
Protecting the environment, protecting our rivers and ponds and protecting the small creatures from the pollution caused by them is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is an obstacle.
So we should not make such a Ganesh Ji, which creates obstacles.
I don't know how you will take these things to me.
Several such institutions and individuals work very hard for the soil Ganesha.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now let us decide that the idols that our old families used to build will also get employment and if they are made from the soil of the pond or river then the environment will also be protected.
My best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be conferred the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had spent her whole life in India to serve the poor.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa receives the title of Saint for serving the poor people of India throughout her life.
In the celebrations that will be held on 4th September, an official delegation led by the Government of India, our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Every moment we learn something from saints, sages, sages and great men.
We will continue to learn, learn and will continue to do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how a big change comes.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with 5 State Governments, has made a successful effort to connect people with clean Ganga and Ganga in the last few days.
On 20th of this month, those people were invited in Allahabad who were the heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women too.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast took oath in the witness of Maa Ganga that they will immediately stop the tradition of defecation in the open in their villages of Ganga coast, they will run a campaign to construct toilets and the village will contribute to cleaning the Ganga. That village will not allow Ganga to be dirty.
I congratulate these Prime Ministers for coming to Allahabad, somebody from Uttarakhand, somebody from Uttar Pradesh, somebody from Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand, somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and the Ministers who have realized this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they took an important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding the manpower.
My dear countrymen, some of these things touch me very much and I have a special respect for those who are imagined.
On July 15, more than a million students of more than seventeen-hundred schools collectively wrote a letter to their parents in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it was so impressed that after receiving the letter, when the school came on the second day after receiving the letter, the parents caught a letter and promised to give it to the Teacher and their parents had promised that they will construct a toilet by the date of their return.
Congratulations to those who had imagined this thing and also to those students who made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who took serious decision to make their child's letter toilet.
That's what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years old in this district - this daughter satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had given up food and that too was not for asking for something for themselves, not for bringing good clothes, not for eating sweets, it was the insistence of daughter Mallamma that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, daughter was stuck on id, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had done satyagraha for the toilet, so also look at the speciality of the village chief Mohammad Shafi that he had spent eighteen thousand rupees and had constructed a toilet within a week.
Look at the strength of this daughter Mallamma's insistence and see the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
How the pathways are opened to solve the problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
The resolution of some Indians has become.
Some Indians have made it their purpose.
But everyone is associated with it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing to it.
His competition will be held and those who will win on October 2nd Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can make films from your mobile phone's amera too.
Come on, move forward, you are my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relations with our neighbors are deepened, our relations are comfortable and our relations are alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President, Respected Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata, All India Radio Maitri Channel.
Now many people will feel that should the President also inaugurate the Channel of a Radio
But this is not the channel of ordinary Radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here AIR Friendship and Bangladesh Wireless, they will content share among themselves and Bengali people will enjoy All India Radio on both sides.
AIR has contributed immensely to the people's contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for connecting with us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of All India Radio for their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of a good Prime Minister but after all I am also a human being like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a bit more.
Such emotional events also provide new energy, new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A mother of about 84 years, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
Had he not forbidden me to declare my name in his letter, I had a feeling that I should talk to you by giving him my name today and he wrote a letter that when you had appealed to leave the Gas Subsidy, I had abandoned the Gas Subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
For me, the letter of Prime Minister of India is not less than a Padma Shri.
Brothers and sisters, You would be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who left the Gas Subsidy and some of my representatives should send a letter to them.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and she wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to emancipate the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and that is why I am a retired teacher, in a few years I will be 90 years old. I am sending you a donation of Rs.
You can imagine that as a normal teacher, a mother who passes on a retired pension, when she gives 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the stove dust and to provide gas connections.
The question is not of 50 thousand rupees, the question is of that mother's spirit and such kind of mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes my country's future confident and powerful.
And he did not write a letter to me as Prime Minister, he wrote a direct letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I salute that mother and also bow down to these millions of mothers of India who have been suffering for the welfare of somebody.
My dear countrymen, we were disturbed due to the famine last year, but this August month has been continuously filled with the difficulties of floods.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central government, the units of the local Swaraj organization, the social institutions and the citizens have tried their best to do whatever they can.
But in the midst of the news of these floods, there were also reports which needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, if we move together then what a big result can we get
This will be remembered in August this year.
In August, 2016, the party which had opposed the political party, the party that did not give up a single chance against each other, and almost 90 parties in the entire country, a lot of parties in the Parliament, all the parties together passed the law of GST.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And this is an example of how big a task is being done by all the parties in one direction.
In the same way, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with one voice.
He also conveyed the message to the world, conveyed the message to the separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all believe that it is the opinion of 1. 25 billion Indians, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, that if anyone knows Kashmir, whether it is a young man or a security guard, it is ours, it is ours, it is ours, it is ours, it is ours, it is our country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer to these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen our unity, to expose more and more and only then can the country make a bright future.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
That's all, thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning, I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will paint every young man with zeal and enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest sports event is going to be the Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to resonate in our ears.
Our hopes and aspirations are very high, but the work of encouraging those sportspersons and those who have been to play in Rio is also for the 125 crore Indians.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organised a grand Run for Rio, Games and Geo, Games and Players.
In the coming days, wherever possible, we should do something to encourage our sportspersons.
No matter how much hobby of food is, everything has to be left.
I'm ready to do this on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to become the Postman in order to convey your message to these players.
If there is no research and innovation then just like stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live on the basis of old technology without research and innovation then we will become outdated in the changing era of the world and therefore the government has taken several steps for the attraction of science, research and innovation towards technology in the new generation.
And so I say - let us aim to innovate and when I say let us aim to innovate, then my AI
If we want to prepare the next generation innovators then our children will have to be associated with it and therefore the government of India has taken up the initiative of an Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakhs will be given to schools wherever there will be such a tinkering laboratory and for maintenance in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre then we have a system for innovation, for start-ups, for experimentation and for bringing it to a position.
In the same way, India is facing many problems.
We see problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technological solutions.
An Atal Grand Challenges has called upon the younger generation of the country to find a problem, to find ways of technology, research, innovate and bring solutions.
The Government of India seeks to give a special prize to the technology discovered for solving our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about the famine and these days the joy of rain is also coming, the news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are working very hard to help the flood victims jointly.
Despite having difficulty due to rain, every mind, every human mind gets overwhelmed because the centre-point of our entire economic activity receives rainfall and cultivation.
Sometimes such a disease occurs that we regret forever.
Engue can be avoided.
Keep in mind some hygiene, some cautiousness and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children. And this is not the case with engue.
Engue comes first in a happy and prosperous region and that is why we understand it.
You must have seen advertising on GST but sometimes we are indifferent to its awareness.
The government, the hospitals and the doctors will do their work. However, we too, in our homes and in our families, dont enter the engagements and be cautious about the diseases caused by water.
I would like to draw your attention to another problem, my dear countrymen.
Life has become so stunning, it has become so racing that sometimes we dont have time to think for ourselves.
If you become sick, then you feel like recovering quickly and so anybody puts an antibiotic in the body.
However, my dear countrymen, the habit of taking antibiotics while walking on these paths can create a grave crisis.
You may be relieved for a few moments, but we should stop taking antibiotics without consulting doctors.
I urge you to complete the course as many days as the doctor has asked you to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves that there is no effect of medicines.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical language and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of how antibiotics should be used.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
The concerns of the lives of the mothers during pregnancy in our country are sometimes very annoying.
In our country, about 30 million women are pregnant every year, but some mothers die at the time of delivery, sometimes the mother dies, sometimes the child dies, sometimes both the child and the mother die.
It is true that in the last decade, the rate of untimely mortality of the mother has decreased, but still the lives of pregnant mothers can not be saved in large quantities.
Blood deficiency during or after pregnancy, delivery infection, high BP - Do not know when to devastate his life.
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be checked free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved and I have specially told Gynecologist whether you cannot provide this service for the poor mothers on the 9th of a month.
Cannot my doctor brothers and sisters spend twelve days in a year for the poor
I am sure you will join me.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
In the battleground of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means how much it will be, we can guess.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Aswattha: Sarvavrikshana i.e. in all trees I am Peepal.
It has been said in the Shukracharya policy - Nasti roots - there is no such vegetation, in which there is no medicinal properties.
He who donates the tree, like a tree, he also gives a wire in the heavens.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare plant good trees and follow their children equally.
Our scriptures - Gita, Venus policy, discipline of the Mahabharata - but in today's generation too there are some people who show these ideals by doing their best.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came to my notice, she touched my heart.
In the Mahabharata Discipline Parva, it is said that the tree also fulfills the responsibilities of the children in the paradise and Sonal has taken the lead in fulfilling the wishes of the society, not only of his parents.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune, in Maharashtra, he married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational manner.
Such a scene touching the mind was in that picture.
Sonal who himself is an agricultural graduate, this idea came to him and presented mango plants in his marriage. See how natures love emerged in the best way.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal saga of love for nature and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatre ji for this innovative endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the temple of Ambaji in the month of Bhadra then once a social worker organisation had decided to plant saplings in the prasad of the temple and he would say to them, See, this is the offering of Mother-Government and this plant will be made big by visiting your village-house and blessing you.
I would like to tell the farmer brothers repeatedly that the fences that we waste our land by fencing on the edge of our fields, why not we cultivate timber instead of that fence.
Today, India has to bring billions of trillions of timber from abroad to build a house, to build a furniture.
If we plant such trees on the edge of our farms, which have been used in the fields, then after fifteen-twenty years, you can sell them by cutting them off from the government's permission. You can also become a new source of income and you can also avoid importing timber to India.
In the past several states have run a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has passed an AMPA law just now, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go to plantation.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted nearly two and a half crore saplings in the entire state on July 1 and he has pledged to plant three crore saplings next year.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, desert-lands - have done such a big forest festival and have pledged to plant 25 lakh saplings.
Twenty-five million plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big a task has been taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover by Twenty Twenty-Nine (2029).
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav.
This year, Gujarat has taken up many projects like Amra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Van - as Van Mahotsav and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am not able to mention all the states, but deserve congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past few days.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign travel, there is a diplomacy, trade and discussions about security, there are several moods - all this has to happen.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Ahimsa, love and forgiveness in the world - when these words fall on the ears, then Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited the Phoeni Settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the train that Mahatma Gandhi had undertaken and the train that had transformed a Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you, this time I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities who had spent their youth for equality, equal opportunity and for the society.
He had fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela, he had lived with Nelson Mandela in prisons for twenty-two years.
In a way, he had sacrificed his entire youth and I got the privilege of visiting these gentlemen - Mr. Ahmad Kathrada, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bios, Ronnie Casrills, a close associate of Nelson Mandela.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they got ready to die for those who lived among them.
On his face, even after doing such a great penance, he could not be seen anywhere.
A kind of duties - the symptom of duties that was shown in the Gita, it appeared to be a very direct form.
My heart will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunities.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
Equality and mummy are the only way that leads us towards a bright future.
Want a good future for children.
Priority will be different, but the path is the same and that path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and mummy.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have shown the basic mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Being a woman, I'm sorry for her family.
And as technology is playing a very big role in the economic system, those who abuse it also come to the ground.
Sometimes you might be confused and they write letters in such a wonderful manner, as if it is the right letter.
Anyone who makes a Letter Pad and sends it, gets your credit card number, debit card number and your account is evacuated through technology.
This is a new method of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I think that we should avoid this fascination, be cautious and if there are false things then we should share with our friends and friends a little bit of awareness.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought good things to my mind and you must have experienced it all, but perhaps you might not have seen it so seriously, but I think there is a need to look at it.
My dear countrymen, the Parliament session is going on these days. During the Parliament session, I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Artistic paintings have been done at the station.
Moreover, they collected the plastic bottles or cans of foil in such garbage in the village and filled them with soil and planted them and made a vertical garden.
And in a way, this vertical garden has been constructed in the plastic bottles at the railway station.
If you ever visit Aligarh then you must see the station.
Nowadays, I am getting news from many railway stations of India, local people are presenting their territory on the walls of the railway station through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those working in this manner in the country, special greetings to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with you, there is also a lot of festivals in our country.
Festivals will be held in the temples, in the places of worship and you too will be associated with the festival even outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival for us.
Like last year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, can you not present Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country
Imagine, give such a gift to a sister who will really protect her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in independent India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can inspire us, create new zeal and an opportunity for our country to do something.
The whole country will be painted with the color of the freedom fighters and once again feel the joy of freedom all around.
This is not a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
You must send his picture on the NarendraModi App.
Create an environment in the country.
Dear countrymen, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I get the good fortune to talk to the country, it is a tradition.
There will be some things in your mind, which you might want to keep your point as intensely from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come to your mind, who feels that as your representative, as your Principal Servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must send me by writing.
Whatever can be said from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 1. 25 billion people.
I invite you, let us remember the sacred sacrifices of the freedom fighters, remember the great men who have spent their lives for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Namaskar to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, greetings.
I am also grateful to All India Radio for making a successful effort to present this mind in regional languages at 8. 00 pm.
And I am also glad that those who listen to me later convey their emotions to me through letters, through telephone, through MyGov website, through the Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
How active the government should be in terms of public interest and how prioritized it should be, my interaction with you for these things is very useful.
I hope that you will certainly strengthen how democracy can be run with public participation by becoming more active.
The heat is going on increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is experiencing a terrible heat fire.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut off and in a way humanity destroyed nature and paved the way for its own destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions and concerns for the environment all over the world.
This time, United Nations has placed a topic on Ero Tolerance for Wildlife Trade on World Environment Day.
It will definitely be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants and also discuss water, how to increase our forest.
Because you must have seen, the fire in the forests in Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - in the lap of the Himalayas
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. I could have had a meeting with all the drought prone states but I did not.
What the states have to say, listen to them closely.
Generally, how much money was spent in the government, how much money was spent by the Government of India - it does not matter much closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government of India that several states have made excellent efforts in the field of water, in relation to the environment, in dealing with the situation of drought, for animals, for the affected human beings and in a way for the government of any party in every corner of the country, it was experienced that what should be the permanent solutions for dealing with this problem for a longer period of time, what should be the sustainable treatment.
In a way, it was a learning experience for me. And I have told my policy commission that there should be some work on how best practices should be taken in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh, have made immense use of technology.
I would like to further convey the special successful efforts of the States through NITI Aayog to us and to the States.
Public participation is the basis of a great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some offerings and even a little offerings fall, then there is an irritation in the mind.
They pick him up and apologize to God five times.
This water is also God's offering.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should have pain.
And that is why water conservation is equally important and water conservation is equally important. And that is why per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and minimum water crops.
Now it is a matter of great happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation and someone is doing sprinklers.
While sitting with the states, some states have successfully used drip-irrigation for paddy and also reduced wages.
When I heard from these states, there are several states that have taken huge targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a great job in drip-irrigation and it is their effort to connect 2-3 lakh hectare to micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign is being carried out in all the states then cultivation will also benefit a lot, water will also be stored.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to make the best use of Godavari and Krishna river waters through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharging in the Neeru Pragati Mission.
People are also shedding sweat and giving money in the mass movement that Maharashtra has created.
I feel that the Jalakshit Camp Campaign - indeed, this movement will be of great help to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has Balram Talab Yojana - nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small figures
Rajasthan and Gujarat have started a big campaign to revive them as Jal Mandir.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Jal Swavalamban campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a massive campaign of hack Dam.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have started a campaign to stop 10-20 km of water by constructing small obstacles in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - let us decide that even a drop of water will not be wasted.
And this is not just a matter of farmers.
This village, poor, labourer, farmer, urban, rural, rich and poor is a matter related to everybody. Therefore, when rainy season is coming, water should be our priority. And this time when we celebrate Diwali, please also enjoy how much water we saved and how much water we stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
What a precious treasure that God has given
Media gave a detailed account of the trouble of water in the past.
I hope that Media should guide people towards water conservation, campaign and Media should also become a partner in ever-growing water crisis.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to make transparent India.
If we want to bring many systems from one corner to the other equally, then our old habits will have to be changed slightly.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic on which if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give so much vegetable in return.
Business was run from a market system.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards cashless society.
We can get the money and also pay the money through the electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can even pay the bill.
And this will never raise the question of theft of the wallet from the zeb.
There will be no concern for maintaining accounts. Automatic accounting will be maintained.
It will be a bit difficult to start, but once the habit is felt, this system will be simple.
And this is the possibility that the bank accounts of almost all the households of the country which we have started the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana these days have been opened.
So in coordination with Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM we can move forward towards this cashless society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan-Chan account.
In the coming days, this card will be used both in terms of credit and debit.
Removing money from the zeb, counting, no need.
There is no need to roam around with it.
Whatever initiatives the government of India has taken, how to pay the payment through a PSLV, how to get the money.
It will be very easy to transact the money through your mobile phone and it is a matter of great happiness that NPIs can be transacted.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your doorstep.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and get used then we will not need this currency, we will not need notes, we will not need money, business will run on its own and there will be a transparency due to this.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobile phones would be in our every hand.
Gradually became habituated, now he can not live without it.
Perhaps this cashless society can take the same shape but it will be better if it happens in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the sports of Olympics come and when the sports starts, then we sit in Sir Patak, how far behind we have not got the gold medal, we have not got the silver mix, we dont run with Bronze.
Everyone in their own way has encouraged and encouraged our sportspersons who went for Rio Olympics.
Writing a song, creating a cartoon, giving a message, encouraging a game, but the entire country should create a positive environment for our sportspersons.
The result will come - will come.
This becomes an extremely powerful force in itself, when a sportsperson feels that 125 crore Indians are standing with him then he gets a lot of courage.
And I have seen the suggestions that came to me from all over the country and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of outball has started to be seen throughout the country.
Many people are making their own teams by taking initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Many people may not be playing but there is so much interest in the sports of thousands and millions of youngsters of the country that it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We are well aware of the attachment of cricket and India but I have seen this kind of attachment in the football which in itself indicates a very happy future.
So we will create an atmosphere of excitement and enthusiasm for all our sportspersons who deserve the liking for Rio Olympics in the coming days.
Nothing can be done by the criterion of victory and defeat.
With sportsman spirit, India will make its mark in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and excitement towards our sporting friends.
In the last eight-ten days, new results have been coming from somewhere.
I am talking about the students who worked hard throughout the year, they gave exams, 10th, 12th, one after another.
It has become clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a pleasure.
My best wishes and congratulations to all those who have succeeded in these results.
Once again I would like to say to those who have not been successful that there is a lot to do in life.
If there is no result according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
We should live with confidence, we should move forward with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come in front of me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me the same thing, hey man, four marks were more likely to be 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friends, my teacher no one was pleased with my 89.
Everyone was telling me, man, your 90 percent remains for four marks.
Now I do not understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this all in life
What I did wasn't that good
Did I get a little less
I don't know, I have a burden on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that perhaps this pain will not only be of you but also of millions and millions of students like you because an environment has become such that instead of satisfaction, dissatisfaction with it is another form of negativity.
We can never take the society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction with everything.
Well, if your family, your friends and friends had appreciated your 89. 33 per cent then you would have liked to do more on your own.
I have written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur in a similar manner.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I do not remember poetry at all, but I had read it a long time ago, a poet wrote that on the anvas of life I made a picture of pain.
I wish, some audience would have shed tears on the picture of this painting.
This was the word of poetry, I do not remember it anymore, but it was the poem of a long time ago, but this was the expression.
You are burdened to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I would say so much to you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening, but remain on your point of view and try to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what you have got, you will never be able to build a new building again.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
The dissatisfaction caused by success cannot become a ladder of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
However, I would like to say this thing more to my neighbours and parents and colleagues that please do not impose your expectations on them.
Friends, Has there ever been a failure in life, does that live
Those who can never get good marks in exams, they go a long way in sports, they go ahead in music, they go ahead in art work, they go ahead in business.
God has given some or the other wonderful mode to everyone.
Just recognise your inner strength and emphasize on it, you will go ahead.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santoor.
There was a time when the Santoor instrument was associated with the Dolk Music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who handled him and made him an important instrument in the world today.
Clarinet - Shehnai was limited to the whole area of our music.
The courts of most of the kings and kings used to reside in their gates.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan handled the clarinet, today it has become the best instrument in the world, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure incurred on the health of our poor families also imbalances the tracks of life.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very low but after getting sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why should we not live such a life, so that there is no disease, there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for preventing cleanliness from disease.
If anyone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the second thing I insist on is Yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
There is an attraction for Yoga all over the world, there is reverence and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have a valuable gift to us, which we have given to the world.
Yoga gives the power to live a balanced life to the stressed world.
Prevention is better than cure. To stay healthy in the life of a person associated with yoga, to remain balanced, to be rich in a strong will power, to have a life full of immense self-confidence, to have concentration in every work- these are comfortable achievements.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just an event, it should increase its scope, it should become a place for every person in his life, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes and 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And June 21, Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes a collective environment causes a change in the life of a person.
See that, get it done in your village, get it done in your locality, get it done in your city, in your school, institution, even in your evening offices.
Start a month from now, look, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that when Yoga and Pranayama are collective in several offices regularly in the morning then the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes, the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to remain behind.
Your being healthy is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I constantly connect with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, greet you all again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please change this situation, Ravi Ji has expressed his anger but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry at the situation, you will remember that former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that print only positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to keep saying this thing. A few days ago a newspaper had written a letter to me, he had said that we have decided that we will not report any negative news on Monday, Positive news will be given, these days I have seen some TV.
This time also I have seen that a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received, there are a lot of stories, suggestions, inspirations, everybody wants to do something or the other and he wants to say that there is a lot of response in all these things that I would like to reconcile.
You might remember the last time I had discussed a book of stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share some of the books with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information about a variety of books
I liked that people are discussing and discussing books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle and many such topics.
Some people have even advised me to talk about many more books .
But one thing I have to admit is that now I ' m not able to spend too much time reading books
But there is an advantage that if you write and write, I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But the experience that we have experienced in the last one month makes me feel that we have to take it forward.
Why don't we create a parent books corner on the NarendraModi App and whenever we read a new book, write about it, discuss it and you can also suggest a good name for our books corner.
Friends, It seems that when I had touched this point in the matter of conservation of water, but perhaps today I am feeling that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart, it was a favourite subject of the common man.
And I am experiencing that water has shocked the hearts of India these days .
Several innovative and effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Be it the government, the NGOs are doing something or the other at the war level.
Looking at the power of collectivity, the mind feels very nice, it is getting very satisfactory.
Villagers worked to provide a definite direction to the waterfalls flowing from the mountains by donating labor.
that ' s also pure native way
This not only prevents soil erosion and waste of crops but also provides water to the fields.
You will be happy to know that Meghalaya, the beautiful state of North East, has become the first state in the country that has formulated its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, cultivation of crops that require less water and do not cause any damage to the farmer.
I would particularly like to congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with farmers and inspiring them to move away from traditional farming to low-water crops.
Now the time has come for the festivals
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from all walks of life reach the fairs .
In these fairs, we can deliver the message of water conservation in a very effective manner, we can set up exhibitions, play street plays, we can deliver the message of water conservation along with festivals very easily.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with zeal and especially children's achievements, their exploits, give us new energy and therefore today I feel like talking about some children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
What I will tell you about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It looks like death is at the entrance, but all these ten children, in the battle of their lives, have defeated not only the fatal diseases like cancer, but have illuminated India's name all over the world due to their exploits.
In sports, we often see that sportspersons become champions after winning tournaments or entering the medals, but this was a rare occasion where they were champions before they participated in the sports competition and that too the champion of the battle of life.
Actually, this month, World Childrens winners games were organized in Moscow.
This is such a unique sports tournament, in which young cancer survivors i. e.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Cootball and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched the A-Sat in March and after that there was not much talk of big and important news like A-Sat in the wake of elections in Chandrayaan-two.
While we gained the ability to kill Satellite, three-and-a-half kilometers from the A-Sat missile, in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this milestone and now, on 22nd July, the entire country saw with pride how Chandrayaan-two moved from Sriharikota to space.
Pictures of the launch of Chandrayaan-two filled the countrymen with pride and zeal and happiness.
Chandrayaan-two, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-two, will further clarify our understanding of the moon
This will enable us to get more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what two great lessons I have received from Chandrayaan-two, I would say, these are two lessons: air and airlessness i. e.
We must trust our talents and capacities, trust our talent and capabilities.
You will be pleased to know that handryaan-two has completely embedded in Indian colors.
It ' s Indian from Heart and Spirit
is entirely an indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it comes to doing something new in the new sector, it will be done in a new way.
Just as our scientists launched all the technical issues in record time, day and night, and launched the handryaan-two, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and a lot of people are surprised that despite disruptions they have not changed the time to reach.
We also have to face temporary set backs in our lives. However, we always have the ability to overcome them.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very interesting competition with the students of the country, with the young friends, about competition and to invite the youngsters of the country.
I urge the young colleagues, students to participate in this ui Competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable by their participation.
I specially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious
This will be a historic event for these victorious students. But for this, you will have to take part in the ui Competition, you will have to score the highest marks and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done one thing observe
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similar efforts towards cleanliness have always inspired the mindset.
The journey that began five years ago, today is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
Its not like that we have achieved an ideal position in sanitation, but the way success has been achieved in sanitation drives from public places to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty .
Just a few days ago I was watching the story of Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in Media
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharti
Some time ago, he took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful.
He started with his team with the dustbins of Lodhi Garden
Through the Street Cart, several areas of Delhi were decorated with beautiful paintings.
When they started engraving their skills from the walls of the school to the slums, the people also got together and in a way this process was going on.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
There may not be any sound in the colors and lines, but the rainbow produced from these pictures proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also feel this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making East to Wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move from waste to Kanchan.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This Comment was from Mohammad Aslam, brother of Shopian of Jammu and Kashmir.
He likes to hear the mind talk program
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June
I think such programmes should be organized every three months .
Also, arrangements should be made for online monitoring of the programme.
In my view, this was the first such programme of its kind, in which the public had a direct dialogue with the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my curiosity to know about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
The program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are
In this programme, for the first time senior officers reached the villages directly and those officers who were never seen by the villagers, they came to their doorsteps so that they could understand the obstacles in the development work and solve the problems.
The programme lasted a week and in all about 4,500 Panchayats in the state government officials gave details of government schemes and programmes to the villagers.
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
How can their services affect the lives of ordinary human beings  The villagers also openly explained their problems .
Friends, This programme was not a government Khanapurni that the officers returned after visiting the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Many more things were also included to make this program interesting
Sports Competition for children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, job cards of MNREGA and SST fertiicates were also distributed
People of Kashmir become open partners in this celebration of development
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was organised in far-flung villages where government officials had to undertake one day and one and a half days pilgrimage while climbing the hills through inaccessible routes.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their reception that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
Organizing Gram Sabhas in these areas, taking part in it in large numbers and formulating schemes for themselves, all this is very pleasant.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred and obstruction in the path of development can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, awarded the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the Sawan month in one of his poems in this way.
People from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way throughout India.
In this season whenever we look around us , it seems as if the earth has covered the greenery sheet .
All around, a new energy begins to communicate
In this holy month many devotees visit Kawand Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami
During this time the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brother and sister .
When it comes to the month of Sawan, you will be very happy to know that this time Amarnath Yatra has included the maximum number of devotees in the last four years.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave
More than the number of pilgrims who joined this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time they have joined in just 28 days.
I would like to especially praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who come back from the journey become convinced of the warmth and affection of the people of the state
All these things are going to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I have been told that in Uttarakhand since the start of Chardham Yatra this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
For the first time since the horrific disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have arrived there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty is made during the monsoon.
There cannot be a greater teacher than tourism and travel to see this beauty of our country and to understand the spirit of the people of our country.
My best wishes to you all for this beautiful and vibrant month of Sawan to communicate new energy, new hopes and new hopes in all of you.
Similarly, the month of August is remembered for uit India.
I would like you to make some special preparations on 15th August so that you people can seek a new way of celebrating this festival of independence and increase public participation.
This is the time on the other hand, when heavy rains are occurring in many parts of the country
By the way, when we look at TV, the only aspect of the rain is flooded all over, flooded water, traffic jams
The second picture of the monsoon, which is enjoyed by our farmer, chirping birds, flowing waterfalls, earth covered with greenery, you will have to come out with your family yourself.
Rain, freshness and happiness i. e.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Today, the people of Christian community around the world are celebrating Easter.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Easter.
And there will be a criterion for some people that on the one hand the exam and on the other the T-20 Ricket World Up. Even today you will probably be waiting for the match of India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
It's a nice momentum.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
It is not a matter of fact that 65 per cent of the population is young and we are lost in the world of sports.
It's time for a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
In 1951, 1962 Asian Games, India won gold medal and in 1956 Olympic Games, India was at fourth position.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower pyria, withdrew, fell down.
Cootball is an opportunity, can you give me your suggestions
I consider it a great opportunity to brand India globally.
I consider it an opportunity to identify the youth power of India and what was found between Match and not in that sense.
With the preparation of this host, we can demonstrate our strength, our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, NarendraModiApp
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism during the holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time also I had requested you people to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, food and living there do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see, you will watch forever, you will watch
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to travel a lot.
When the Chief Minister was not there, the Prime Minister was not there and was a young age like you, I traveled a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you contribute to cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening scientifically but it's happening.
As a tourist, can you also emphasize on cleanliness on tourist destination
I believe my youth will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
However, we 1. 25 billion Indians should decide that if we want to strengthen our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world tourism and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youngsters of our country.
Whether it is a government or institutions or a society or a citizen, all of us have to do this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, I do not like this thing that the holidays should come in such a way.
You also think in this direction.
Will your vacations, the important years of your life and even the important times of your life go the same way
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you make a pledge to add a new thing to your personality, a talent in your holidays
If you do not swim, you can make a solemn pledge in the holidays, if I learn to swim, if I don't come to cycling then I will take a bicycle.
Even today, I type computers with two fingers, so can I learn typing
How many skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why don't we increase our strengths
Just imagine, somebody wants big classes, some trainer, some big ees, some big budget. This is not the case.
You should also assume that I will make the best of the waste.
Look at something and start making it from it.
Namaste Prime Minister, you said in the last summer holiday that the birds also feel heat, so we should put a pot in water in a utensil and put it on our balcony or on the terrace, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I enjoyed it, on this pretext many of my birds became friends.
I request you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I didn't think that today I would say something on this subject but that Abhi reminded me that last year I had been in the pottery outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi, a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved the birds a lot.
He wrote in his poem - Do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donations and fill in the hood, we will fill the sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi Ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and express my gratitude that you have reminded me of very important things.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that those who sell milk near our house, those who sell newspapers, those who come to Postman come.
Sometimes those who sell utensils pass through there, those who sell clothes pass.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Have we ever watered him
Shilpa, I am very grateful to you. You have placed a very sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
This thing is very small but if the postman came to the house in the midst of the heat and we drank water then it would be very good for him.
Well, this is the nature of India.
But Shilpa, I am grateful to you for observing these things.
What is the situation in the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the period of good harvest these days, what are the reasons for medicines
Moreover, there is a button in it that connects you directly with agricultural scientists and with experts.
If you put a question in front of him then he answers, explains to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters to download this farmer facility App on their mobile phones.
Try, do you do something for you
And yet if you feel some deficiency, please make a complaint to me.
But our countrymen will also have to think about what will happen without water
Whether these are the ways of water supply in our ponds, through water flow in our ponds where there is garbage or some encroachment then the water supply stops and the water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places for more water harvesting by digging and cleaning once again
If you save as much water as you save, if the water is saved in the first rain, if the ponds are filled, if our river drains are filled, then if the rain is also left behind then our loss is reduced.
This time you must have seen that you have taken the lead in constructing 5 lakh ponds, farm ponds.
MGNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water harvesting.
There will be several such villages in the country, several such progressive farmers will be there and there will be several such aware citizens who would have done this thing.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizer has made our motherland sick and we are the sons of Mother Earth and children. How can we see our motherland sick
This is the case with the fertilizer, however best fertilizer, but if we use more fertilizer then it will become a cause of wastage.
The more the water will be saved, the more it will be beneficial for the farmer, the more it will be saved.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has focused on World Health Day and beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of illness Kurupi guests enter their house and body behind it.
It is said that in 2014, there were about 6.5 million diabetes patients in India.
The reason for 3 deaths is that diabetes was found.
And there are two types of diabetes, one is descendant in Type-1, Type-2. Type-1, it is hereditary, it is for the parents so the child gets it.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, hence it has been kept in the World Health Day on 7th.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for this thing.
Physical labor is decreasing.
The name of the sweat is not-o-disappointment, it is not happening.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking inspiration from 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We never hesitate to get medical check-ups done.
And after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that Oh, yes, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know that when I was young, I used to be afraid to hear the name of TB.
But there is a lot of TB patients in comparison to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
You should check once.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and continue the treatment till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you that whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to defeat it.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But it does not happen to the government, doctors, medicines unless you do it.
And that is why today I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important occasions are coming in the month of April, especially the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Sahib Ambedkar on April 14th.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mau, the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
Baba Sahib has given us a lot to become a good citizen.
We can pay our homage to them by following that path as a good citizen.
Within a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Celebrated differently in different states.
My best wishes to everyone for my New Year.
You can hear at your own time.
You can listen to your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to you.
Indias youth takes time to get information about it and to watch on TV.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to go.
As before, he doesnt go on the same route, he wants to do something new, he wants to see something new.
And there is a lot of employment potential through tourism.
And the identity of your personality will increase so much that your self-confidence will increase.
It will probably be a matter of your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download it in your mobile phone through this Kisan Suvidha App then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and wealth.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for the rest, there has been an opportunity for summer vacations but it becomes an opportunity for the farmer to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his farm so that he does not want to waste even a drop of rain.
It is very important for the farmers to start the season of cultivation.
Isn't that bad food
You must worry about him.
But when TB and deaths were added then we were scared but now we have become irresponsible towards TB.
My dear countrymen, greetings
You might be listening to me on the radio, but the mind will be thinking that children's exams are starting and some people's 10th-12th exams are probably starting on 1st March.
So the same thing will happen in your mind.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about the exams of your children.
But if we change our way of looking at the exams, perhaps we can be anxious.
I had said in the last episode of my mind that you must send me your experiences, your suggestions on the NarendraModiApp.
I am glad that the teachers, those who have been careers, those students, parents, some thinkers of the society have sent me a lot of things by writing to me.
Secondly, there were thousands of things that I believe that perhaps this is a very important topic.
However, most of us have confined the topic of exam to the school premises or to the family or the student.
The suggestions received on my App suggest that these topics should continue to be discussed throughout the country.
I would like to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers in this episode of my mind today.
I will also tell some of the things I have heard, which I have read, which I have been told.
I will add something that I think.
But I am confident that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to give exams.
I would like to recite to you the message he has sent to the youth of India such as Bharat Ratna, Mr. Sachin Tendulkar, whom he is proud of: - Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that the exams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
I have only one message that your parents will execute from you, your teachers will do the rest of your family members and friends.
Wherever you go, everybody will ask you how your preparation is going on, how many personalities will score you.
I would like to say this thing that you yourself will set some target for yourself and you will not come to the expression of someone else's expectation.
You will work hard, but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to indulge in a solution.
And I always tried to achiev those targets.
My focus was on ball pay and targets automatically became slow-slowly achievable.
I would like to tell you that it is very important to have your thinking positive.
Positive results will follow the positive thinking.
So you must be positive and the top one must give you good results, this is my full hope and I would like to give you best wishes for the exams.
Friends, See what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't press the burden of this expectation.
You only have to make your future.
You decide your goal by yourself, decide your target by yourself - free from mind, free from thinking, free from power.
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, no one will be able to stop you from moving forward and when you break your own previous record then you will not be able to expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from within.
Friends, do not consider the examination to be a game of digits.
Where did you reach, how much did you get
Do not get stuck in that account.
Life should be linked with a great purpose.
One should walk with a dream, one should be determined.
These tests, whether they are going to the right place or not, they account for it.
And that is why if these dreams remain vast and vast, then the examination will automatically become a joyous festival.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
Let's move forward with a very big objective and it will never be less than expected, then disappointment will not come.
And you'll have the courage to try, to force, and to try.
Thousands of people have written small things to me on my App.
Shreya Gupta has emphasized that there is a healthy mind in a healthy body.
Besides studying students, also take care of your health so that you can write well in your eam.
Now, on the last day I will not say that you will start punishing and you will go for three kilometers or five kilometers to run.
But one thing is true that what kind of routine you have, especially during your exams.
Anyway, 365 days our routine should be in line with our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with one thing of Shri Prabhakar Reddy Ji, he has specifically requested that he sleep on time and he should get up early in the morning and revision.
Access to the examination centre and other things should be reached prematurely.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said this thing, I probably do not dare to say this because I am a little indifferent to sleeping and my friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
This is one of my shortcomings, I'll try to fix it too.
Sleeping time, deep sleep is as important as your day-long activities and this is possible.
Otherwise, some people are used to talking on long telephones before sleeping.
And when I talk about gold, don't think that I'm asking you to sleep for exam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free condition to give you a good examination at the time of the exam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be such that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the sons came down, then say that Modi had asked him to sleep, so I fell asleep.
You won't do that
I don't believe you.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if one or half part of our body suffers a little.
Not only this, our routine also gets ruined.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You see, do not entrap yourself in the habit of doing composition in whatever is determined by you people.
Decide and look at it.
You must have seen these two types of people.
The kind of paper that will be produced will have a negative impact on the tension.
On Viswanathan Anand, he will share his experiences.
You must have seen that their eyes do not go anywhere.
Never listened to us, the incident of Arjun's life, how he looked at the bird's eye.
Just likewise, when Viswanathan is watching him play, his eyes are absolutely bigger than his eyes and he expresses peace within him.
It is true that someone should say this thing, that is why it is difficult to say that there will be peace within.
You are not talking to your friends or you are walking alone, you are shivering, you are shaking a lot of books and last moments, then it cant be a peaceful mind.
You can imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and there are very good things at the bottom.
But suddenly a stone hits the water and the water starts to move, then what a wonderful look that looked below
If the water is calm, then how deep things are, they appear.
But if the water is turbulent, then nothing looks down.
You will not be able to find that treasure.
If you have a peaceful mind then your treasure will emerge before you and your exam will be very simple.
Sometimes I try to understand it by concentrating more and more, I feel stress within me.
Then I guess, no, I'll relax a little, I'll be fine.
So I have developed my own technology.
I'll breathe a lot.
I breathe deeply.
I take a deep breath three times or five times, the time goes up to 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind gets completely calm and gets ready to understand things.
Maybe this is my experience, you can also be of use.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If the parents are also educated in the house and even if their parents are teachers, then they write the entire paper again, tell me what you wrote, what happened
Man, I made a mistake.
Hey man, I knew this, but I did not remember.
We get stuck in the same.
Refresh the memories of old laughter and happiness.
If you ever have gone somewhere with your parents, then remember the scenes there.
Spend half an hour just after leaving them.
Rajat ji's talk is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while explaining it in the present context, is trying to bring this ritual to the country and the world.
I am also grateful to revered Murari Bapu for giving us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I can see that this time the people who have told me their experiences have discussed Yoga.
And it is a matter of great happiness for me that somebody does something or the other about Yoga.
Friends, I must say today, start doing yoga tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least exams, so dont do it today.
If you do then do it.
But it is true that whether a student is in his life or the heir of his life, Yoga is a very big key in the journey of inner development.
Simple is the key.
You must pay attention to that.
Yes, if you are familiar with any yoga close to yourself, if you ask them about it then they would not have done yoga earlier in the days of exam. Even then two or four things will tell you what you can do in two-four minutes.
Look, if you can
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are very quick to attend the exam hall and you want to sit on your bench at the earliest.
Why do these things hurry
Why not manage your entire day's time to stop in traffic, even then we will be able to reach on time.
Otherwise, such things create a new tension.
And one thing, whatever time we have got, the question papers that are instructions, we sometimes feel that it will eat our time.
It's not like that, friends.
If you closely read those instructions then it will take two minutes to three minutes to five minutes and there will be no harm.
However, once again I had the same paper with confidence, now I have this paper, no new questions are coming, I have to deal with so many questions. And when I started thinking again, he wrote that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I did not read the same thing, but when I read the same thing again, I came to know that no question has been placed in another way, but this is the same thing I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems to be difficult by not understanding the questions.
I would like to emphasize on the fact that you read the questions twice, read the questions three times, read four times and try to match with those whom you know, that question will be simplified before writing it.
It is a matter of great happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our most respected scientist, CNR Rao, have stressed on patience.
In very few words, but very good message has been given to all the students.
Whatever I take half an hour to say, they say that in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
This is what he has said, dedication, determination, diligence, remain firm, friends, remain steadfast.
If you are stuck, then you will be afraid too.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now, on my App, Ruchika Dabus has shared her exam experience.
He said that there is a constant effort in his family to create a positive atmosphere at the time of exams, and this was also discussed in his fellow families.
Together, there is a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, Positive approach exposes the political frame of mind positive energy.
Whatever you may be at any stage of your life, the best examples, the truthful events also provide a great inspiration, a great strength and a new path in times of crisis.
We all read about the inventor Thomas Elva Edison, our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bubble illuminates the lives of our people.
This is called, the prospects of success are also inherent in failure.
K. Rolling is an excellent example that anybody can achieve success at any time.
Harry Potter Services is popular all over the world today.
But it was not from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face.
Rolling himself had said that in difficulties, all the energy used to be used in that work, which really mattered to him.
Nowadays I am not only for a student but also for the entire family and the entire school, for a teacher.
But the situation is not good without the support system of parents and teachers alone.
By combining all these things, be it the teacher, the participants or even senior students, we can become a team and move ahead in a planned manner with the same thinking.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on App, he has complained that parents should never pressurize their children to ask for more marks.
Just encourage to prepare.
They should remain relaxed and worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden his expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to say more to parents today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he's talking to some of his friends, don't stop.
Create a light environment, create a positive environment. See, how much contribution will be made by your son or daughter.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead with the speed of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, science and technology should be an integral part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes success is achieved very late and when success is achieved then the world view also changes.
Perhaps, you might have been very busy in exams, perhaps you might not have received a lot of news in your mind.
But I want to repeat this thing to the countrymen too.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important discovery in the world of science.
Scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, something went on and after nearly 100 years, a success was achieved.
Gravitational aves were highlighted and detected for the sake of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only certifies the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is also considered a great discovery for Physics.
But as an Indian, all of us are happy to note that the sons of our country, the promising scientists of our country are associated with it in the entire process of exploration.
I would like to congratulate all those scientists from the bottom of my heart.
Our scientific efforts will continue to pursue this discovery in the future.
There are two such systems in the world, India is third.
Indias engagement will give a new impetus to this process and a new momentum.
India will surely be an active partner in the process of this great scientific discovery of human welfare in the midst of its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I want to write a number and you can listen to my mind by calling it a missed call from tomorrow and also hear it in your mother tongue.
I also have to give the exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians are going to take my examination.
But yes, you must have seen, I must have heard how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just get my exam tomorrow, you start tomorrow.
And if we all succeed then the country will also succeed.
Friends, I convey my best wishes to you all.
Freedom from the stress of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I take a closer look at this portal from Pune, Shri Ganesh V.
No, we have to change it according to the requirements of India, wherever a poor person works for his labour, he gets physical labour, however, if an innovation makes such a thing that the poor should get some facilities for his labour, I also consider it a start-up and I would ask the bank to help such a young man, I would like to say to him that he will get courage to move forward, will he get a market in the same way, is the intelligence and wealth of our younger generation limited in just a few cities
Then I came to my mind that I think that with an eye we feel that he is a disabled person, but experience suggests that he has an extra power and an extra power. And then he came to my mind that why we should use the word 'Divyang' instead of a disabled person in our country. These are those people who have such a part or more organs that have divinity, there is a communication of divine power that we do not have the ordinary body. I like these words.
When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, can we celebrate 26th January by citizens, by children of schools and colleges, the number of great men who have statues in our city, cleanliness of the premises, the best cleanliness, the best hygiene, the best and the best beauty in our city on 26th January
Dear Countrymen, Namaste
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated the holiday very well.
There must have been an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business jobs have also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas will also be started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes the festivals work to heal the wounds, and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes at this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Every corner of the world has consistently reported natural calamities.
The news of such natural calamities continues to emerge.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
In our country, in the last few days due to heavy rains and unseasonal rains and long rains, particularly in Tamil Nadu, it has affected the states as well.
Many people died.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of grief.
State governments gather full power in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving forward at a rapid pace and will continue to play his role in taking the country forward.
But when they look at the crisis all around, we need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be a part of an agriculture department, because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was limited to this place.
Today its form has changed.
After Nepal's earthquake, I had spoken to Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
A good start has happened.
Today, I got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District, Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide a lot of people on farming.
One of my questions is, how to guide these fields, how to fire the fields, how to guide them on the straw or wheat shrub, how much damage is being done to the micro-organisms that are causing this pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji was very happy to hear your message.
One is that you are a farmer who cultivates organic farming.
And you do organic farming yourself. You understand the problem of farmers very well.
And your concern is correct but it does not happen only in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of all of us in India and traditionally we are on the path of burning the residues of our crops.
Secondly, what are the measures, there is no training.
And when the impact of this crisis started coming towards the cities, a slight sound was heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
Crop residues are also very valuable.
They are an organic manure in themselves.
Secondly, due to the burning, the upper layer of the earth is burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters should think for a moment that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidney should be good but if the skin above the body is burnt then what will happen
Similarly, the remnants of the crop do not burn the stubble just by burning the stubble, the skin of the mother Earth burns.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And so his positive efforts should be made.
Once again this chin was dumped in the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if you put a little water by putting earthworms in a pit, then it becomes a good type of organic manure.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated bananas.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, sometimes they had to spend Rs.
And as long as those who picked him up brought tractor-workers, he used to stand like this.
However, some farmers produced 66, 8-8 inches of that chin and buried it in the ground.
There is so much water in this banana pool that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then it does not need to get out for three months.
The first thing that had to be spent on the cleaning of the thumb, today the demand for the thumb has increased.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist, how small experiments can benefit.
Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 3rd December.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had discussed Organ Connectivity.
I had also discussed the helpline of NEET for Organ Connectivity and I was told that after that thing the phone calls increased by almost 7 times.
Very well-known people, including film actress Raveena Tandon, joined it.
Organ conation can save valuable lives.
Angadan comes in a way with immortality.
When one body goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation than this
I am confident that there will be greater awareness on this sector and in the true sense the needy will be of great help as these help cannot be obtained from anywhere unless one donates.
As I said earlier, December 3 is observed as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped, they are also rich in a tremendous courage and strength.
Sometimes the pain occurs when they are ridiculed sometimes.
Occasionally the feeling of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision and look at them then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to go through.
If we get a little trouble, we sit down to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And that is why all these things are a source of inspiration for us.
Their will power, their way of dealing with life and their desire to transform the crisis into strength is immense.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 years old.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists.
I lost a part of the intestine and the intestine.
Serious nature has become a special injury.
The ability to stand on his feet always went for the sake, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism injury could not even hurt them.
Their own zeal, but the biggest thing is that without any reason an innocent person has suffered such a big problem, the youth has been in danger but neither any resentment nor any anger has changed this crisis into sensitivity.
He offered his life in social service.
The body does not accompany but for 20 years they have been drowned in children's education.
How did the infrastructure improve for physically handicapped people
How to develop systems for disability in government offices, in public places
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specifically remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and dedication to him on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
They are giving new light of living, showing the path.
3rd December is an opportunity to remember everyone like this and get inspiration from them.
Our country is so huge.
There are several things in which we are dependent on governments.
Whether it is a middle class person or a lower middle class person or a poor person, a dalit, afflicted, exploited or deprived, there is a constant connection with the government systems.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad experience with some government babu in his life.
And that evil experience changes the way we look at the government system throughout our life.
There is a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government are doing such good work with a sense of service and dedication that we can never see.
Sometimes we dont even know that it is so easy because we dont know that a government system, a government servant is doing this thing.
ASEAN workers in our country, which is a network of networks across the country.
Sometimes we have heard or heard discussions about ASEAN workers among the people of India.
But when I am the world famous family entrepreneur of Belgates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
The last time we had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both such Belgates and Milindgates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Their own retirement time and whatever they have earned throughout their life are working for the poor.
Whenever they come, they meet and those ASA workers who have got the opportunity to work with them, they appreciate them so much and they have enough to say that what kind of dedication they have to do to the ASHA workers.
He tells all these things how much enthusiasm is there to learn new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has given special respect to an ASA worker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is a hope-maker and the entire population of the schedule-tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Mani Singh, a hopeful worker of this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this Tendgaon.
If you get the news of a small fever from home to home then you will be able to reach there.
Based on the primary arrangements he has been taught to get treatment.
Emphasis on using every home pesticide mosquito nets.
Just as your own child sleeps properly and as much care as he should, ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with complete dedication to save the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he fought malaria, prepared to fight the entire village.
How many such Jamuna Mani will be.
How many millions of people will be next to us.
We'll look at them with a respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How do the happiness and sorrow of society become big companions
I glorify all such ASEAN workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to look at this.
See, not only this, but also show it to others and you may feel like adding such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
And if an enthusiastic young man visits the schools of Ados-Noveh, Class VIII and tells the children of class VIII, Novy and Tenth about these books then look at this thing that happened here.
So you can truly become a social teacher.
I invite you to join us in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
There is also concern about climate change, global warming and dagger-dagger. And before doing all the work, it has been approved as a standard.
Earth's temperature should not increase anymore.
It is also a matter of concern for everyone.
I had once said that one should shut down the street lights on the night of full moon and take a bath in the light of full moon for hours.
You should experience the light of that moon.
A friend had sent me a link to see and I got the opportunity to see him, so I felt like telling you this thing.
Noorjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have got the opportunity to read more from a woman TV.
But one such thing is doing that perhaps nobody would have thought.
He is working to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting the war from the dark and is illuminating his name.
She has formed a committee of women and has installed a plant of solar powered lanterns and she gives lanterns for a monthly rent of Rs. 100.
It costs around Rs. 3-4 per day but there is light in the entire house and it works day long to recharge the lanterns with solar energy in that plant.
Now look at what the big people of the world will do for climate change but one Noorjehan may inspire everyone, it is doing this thing.
And anyway, Noorjaha means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Nurjahan and I also congratulate EET because he presented the work that is going on in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
Thank you Abhishek ji.
The message you sent to me from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA Yojana under the funded.
Those who do not get the money, they get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has been good. In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri MRAY scheme.
Be it a washerman, a barber, a newspaper seller, a milk seller.
Small businessmen and I am glad that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are from SC, ST and B, who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told the story of his enthusiasm.
I've got a lot of news.
Someone just told me that there is no Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs. 8 lakhs from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And he started sweeping dress and cleaning business.
I had said during my cleanliness drive that cleanliness drive is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker and they are doing that work and I was told that in such a short span of time 2 lakh rupees were returned to the bank.
After all, this is our intention under the MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Mamta Sharma of Bhopal that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
She is working to make a wallet.
But earlier he used to get more money and he used to run his business with great difficulty.
Now due to his good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And due to the earlier extra interest and due to the reasons that he was spending, this money came into his hands this month, almost a thousand rupees were saved every month.
And his family started flourishing even a good business.
But I would like that the plan should be further publicized.
All our banks are more sensitive and help more and more small people.
These people really run the economy of the country.
People who do small things are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize that.
It's good, but it's better to do.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary, I had discussed Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that should continue to be awareness in the social life.
Rashtriya Jagrayam Vyama International Vigilance is the price of liberty, this ritual should continue.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, I want to make it a plan.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on that.
How is the structure of the programme
What are the people
How to increase public participation
I said for all suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big pries have also been declared.
You should also apply your creative mind.
How can Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra of unity integrity connecting this mantra with each other
What kind of plan, what kind of program is there
Whether it is life-style or magnificent or life-saving, it should be easy to connect with everyone.
What should the government do
WHAT DO WIVIL SOCIETY
There can be many things.
I enjoy wearing clothes, but I will be urging exercise.
I would urge you to keep the body fit, for some time or the other, this good weather will definitely be used for exercise.
And this is what we have to do in the family by creating an environment, by celebrating one family and one hour all together.
So it's a good weather, then it's a good habit.
Once again I got the privilege of connecting with you all with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India is going to play the fifth e-day match between South Africa and South Africa in Mumbai.
This series is named Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all my players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Kendra of AIR.
Congratulations because when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I have to talk about Kerala once again today.
The students of Saint Mary Per-Primary School of Chittoor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
On the one hand, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb impressions, on a very big cloth.
That image of Mother India, the map of India has sent me.
Earlier, I was surprised that why he made a map of India with his thumb mark.
However, when I read his letter, I realized how wonderful symbolic he has given.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are also trying to make people aware in their area and their mission is Angadan.
They are running public awareness campaigns for organ donation.
He has also performed drama in many places so that the understanding of Angadan spread among the people.
Angadan became a trend and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter asking people about organ donation in their minds.
They say Angadan should make a festival.
These days I also receive a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me such a message.
One million eyes need light every year.
Organ can be donated on death in road accidents.
There are many legal confusions too.
Efforts have also been made to guide states in this direction.
Some States have made a very good effort to speed up the paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the frontline in the field of organ donation.
Several social institutions and NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been established to promote organ transplant.
A 247 helpline 1800114770 service is also available.
And we have been told that Ten Tukten Bhunjitha is a very good description of the joy of renunciation of Ten Tukten Bhunjitha.
In the past, we had all seen on TV that a poor handmaid, Hawker and his wife were transplanted at GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this fiber was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by special arrangements.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Angadan Mahadan
We must fulfil this feeling of Ten Tukten Bhunjitha and emphasize this thing.
Dear countrymen, just now we celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, Deepawali will also celebrate the festival.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
For the first time on the soil of India, it is being organized on such a large scale.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
One of the largest conferences of African countries is being held outside Africa.
India-Africa relations are deep.
The population of India is the same as the population of African countries.
And if we combine both then we have one-third of the world's population.
And say millions of years ago, it was the same land.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And nearly 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a major role in training the younger generation of African countries.
Human Resource Development, Apacity Building, has studied more than 25,000 African students in India.
And today there are leaders of many countries of Africa who have studied in India.
So how deep is our relationship
And from that point of view this summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit occurs, the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, a meeting of the leaders is going to be held in a summit.
See, it is our endeavor that this should also be a meeting of the people.
And this time, the government of India, especially the RM Ministry, has done a very good programme.
The programme of 'Shay Competition' was organised amongst the children of all the failing schools of BSE, the programme of writing poems, the program to increase their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren wrote about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar to Memories of Mahatma Gandhi, an exhibition, Mobile Exhibition is reaching Delhi on 29th October while travelling from Porbandar to Northern States.
Millions of school children saw the exhibition, village-village people saw it.
There were very excellent types of compositions in this competition.
My attention goes to a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But we clearly see the opportunity to connect with the people.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the R Ministry.
On August 15, I had proposed a proposal regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana for the last time.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Being engaged in a big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
Wherever these ideal villages are happening, the head of the village, the collector of that place, some MPs of that place, the Indo-Government and the state government together discussed the topic of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas of that area have been wasted.
However, our MPs of that place are very senior and sometimes there have been deputy speakers in the Parliament. Mr. Karia Munda ji has spent his life for the tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Karia Munda ji, Honble Member of Parliament.
That's what I got from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself got consumed in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose the village panchayat of Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh for the ideal village.
The rest of the system is being arranged but they have done a very special innovative job.
Shriman Ruvala ji started the Kurtai Kut Sugarcane festival on 11th March in the village.
People from all regions united in it.
How can the village be made a hub of economic activity, how can we mark the village's production
His endeavour to build a self-reliant village along with an ideal village is indeed a privilege of congratulations to Shriman Ruwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of mind and not of sanitation.
Savita Rai from Mumbai has sent a message through a telephone, every year we clean our homes to prepare for Diwali.
We should make this Diwali clean along with our homes and our outdoor environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I want to remind you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media has launched a big campaign especially after the festival of Diwali. And after Diwali, everywhere the firecrackers were lying there, they said that it is not right.
So your point is that we should do as much as we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I especially want to congratulate the entire media world of India.
India Awards were given and I was also looking at the kind of activity that is going on.
How-how people are working themselves like a One Like One Mission for this.
How many places are there in our country that have been kept so clean
All these things were exposed and I had heartily congratulated that commendable work of India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhata Abhiyan has been undertaken, I have seen that Shri Ramuji Rao is very old and specially from Andhra, Telangana, but his enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children from about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public spaces, stations, religious places, hospitals or parks, a massive campaign of cleanliness has been started at several places.
Now these news in itself gives a glimpse of the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News has started a programme in the name of 'India is the country of mine' and he has trained the countrymen by highlighting the awareness about cleanliness among the people.
There are hundreds of channels and thousands of newspapers in our country, everybody has not been able to take the names of all, I have been running this campaign due to lack of time.
And that is why Savita Rai ji has suggested that today the entire country is considering this work as its own and it is moving forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor, Mr. Shanmuganathan, has written to me a chitti and by writing a chitti, I have mentioned the Mavalynnnong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has taken a lead in sanitation and almost every generation is fully dedicated towards this cleanliness.
And they say that a few years ago they got the award as the Cleanest Village of Asia.
This is the belief that our country will be clean.
And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say that 1. 25 billion Indians with pride that we have freed our Mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has gone home.
When a poor person goes for a small job, no one knows what to recommend, what to suffer and how a group of brokers grabs money from them.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who tests a person in a minute or two minute interview.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we should end the tradition of interview on these small piracy jobs.
My dear young friends, today I want to say with pride that the government has completed the entire process and there will be no interviews for recruitment in Group D, Group C and Non-Getted posts of Group B of the Central Government.
1st January, 2016 will come into force.
We will not make any obstacles in the ongoing process, but, from January 1, 2016, it will be implemented.
My best wishes to all young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget we announced an important scheme.
In our country, gold has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold is considered the medium of economic security.
The key to crisis time is considered gold.
Gold can become the economic wealth of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am glad that whatever we had promised in the budget, in the festival of Diwali and while Dhanteras and people purchase gold specifically that day, we are going to launch important schemes before that.
We have brought the Gold Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest on it like you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier, we used to keep in the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep the gold in the bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say that the countrymen can now become gold property or not
Can gold be converted from head-money into a vibrant force or not
That's what we have to do with you.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
One more thing is that in the sovereign gold bonds you do not feel sleepy in your hands.
So you'll get two and a half thousand rupees for that paper.
So we are starting this.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will keep this scheme guaranteed for security in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold queen.
It has been almost 70 years since independence but we have been using the Foreign Gold Coin or the Gold Bullion Bars as well.
Besides, the Gold Division of 20 grams will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
Iron man has introduced his strength in the form of a man.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was.
Geographically, he showed taxes, but the mantra of unity should always be a medium of contemplation, behaviour and expression.
Many creeds, many sects, many dialects, many castes, different surroundings, many diverse surroundings, our country is full of diversity and this diversity is due to which we are decorated.
If this diversity was not there then perhaps the beauty for which we are proud of can not be done.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill and unity are the herbs of development.
Over the last several years, on 31st October, Run for Unity programmes are being organized in many corners of the country.
I have heard that its plans are being made around this time too, people are preparing for the race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race for unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also the race for unity.
Let us pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Push forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali and the house will be cleaned.
New things will be purchased.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated separately in every corner of our country.
My best wishes to you all for the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come to mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Deepawali, I have to visit Britain.
I'm very excited to visit Britain this time.
The government of India and the state governments also provide scholarships to such promising children who go abroad, whether they are Dalits, tribals or backwards.
I believe that when our children from India go to study in the UK then this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for him, it will become a land of inspiration and learn something in his life but later living for the country, Baba Saheb Ambedkar gave this message and did it.
And that is why I am saying that during my visit to Britain, I am particularly thrilled, I have been entangled in the topics for several years and now that building becomes the property of 125 crore Indians and Baba Saheb Ambedkar's name is associated with it then you can guess how much happiness people like me will feel.
I am also going to get another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Visvesvara.
The work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy and for the Empowerment of Women several years ago is a truly studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visvesvara on the land of London is an excellent example of how the great personalities of India thought centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are connected then the hearts of all of us are filled with thrill.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with the matter of mind.
Through telephone, I keep receiving your suggestions through MyGov.in.
AIR is also discussed in your letters.
There is talk of calling government officials.
Some people write their problems, they also try to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but still there are so many languages that I have learned no.
However, I am grateful to All India Radio for broadcasting this thing in the regional language of every state at 8 pm.
Even if that voice belongs to someone else, but the thing is in my mind.
Last year I was completing one year and today we are entering a new year.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jai Hind
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
And on the other hand, the Parliament of the country is also discussing about the cleanliness of India and on the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the other hand, the children of this country should talk about cleanliness and on the other hand what could be the good fortune of this country, this movement that is going on, the atmosphere of hatred towards filth, the atmosphere of hatred towards filth and cleanliness will compel the governments to work.
Institutions of local Swaraj - be it Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Municipality, Municipal Corporation or State or Centre - everyone has to work on it. We have to move forward this movement, we have to move ahead despite the shortcomings and we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we should work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
And I was surprised to know that when I asked him, he used to interpret the verse in English, he used to define it in Hindi, when I asked him, when I asked him that he was speaking from the age of five years.
They said, we dont even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, just read the Gita and do something else
Once again, I got the opportunity to talk to you people and to come amongst you.
People in the far south are dyed at the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes and schemes for social security for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, in a comprehensive manner, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small request that we should give this security plan to our sisters on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
The big information that I have received is that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since its inception.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been given to mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I also extend my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, as I am talking to you, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a massive scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
We had to open an account with zero balance but the poor saved and saved Rs.
The mainstream of the economy is the banking sector and this system has reached the houses of the poor so that the scheme of bank-friends is also emphasized.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
Now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraft under the Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And the belief that the poor can get money from the bank is also born.
Once again, I congratulate all the stakeholders and urge the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened their bank accounts so that you do not break the bond with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, it's your job to hold it now.
All our accounts should be active.
But in a very short span of time, the enlightened people of Gujarat, all my citizen brothers and sisters took care of the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and then once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood is right and we have to walk shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell you the truth that the experience, the way I got the opportunity to hear them, in a way something like music is playing.
Selecting his words, his way of talking, that is, the generosity that is in the Sufi tradition, which has a musical rhythm, all of them have been experienced in the midst of these scholars.
I liked it very well.
Perhaps it is most necessary to reach the right form of Islam to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition, which is associated with love and generosity, will take this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity and also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we dont believe in any sect but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate to receive this invitation.
In India, scholars from the Buddhist traditions of many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also been invited to it and it is a matter of great happiness for me that they have invited me to Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, went to Bodh Gaya.
I am going to have the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a very happy moment for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to tell you something specially today.
I have already mentioned this topic in the matter of mind.
You must have heard, I must have heard in Parliament, I must have heard in public meetings, I must have heard about the mind.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mind is open about the dispute regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I have been repeatedly saying that I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers.
It means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
However, there was one thing incomplete and that was 13 such points which were to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought them in Ordinance but during these disputes, the matter got entangled.
We have been implementing the 13 points related to direct economic benefits of the farmers by bringing them under the rules so that the farmers do not face any loss or financial loss. And that is why we are completing the 13 points that were left in the previous law. And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that for us Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not a slogan.
One more thing I have to say is that two days ago it was fifty years before the war of 1965 and when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Mantra.
And it is very natural to remember the tricolor of India, its pride and pride.
I salute all the relatives of the victory of the 65th War.
I salute the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi tradition last week, it was a pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to interact with the dignitaries of the country for hours.
And I am glad that India is doing excellent work in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are actually doing excellent kind of work.
Now we have the opportunity to see how these amendments reach the common man.
How to convert the principles into tools
How to connect Lab with and
He has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that for me it was a very inspiring and education too.
And I saw that many young scientists were talking to them with excitement, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And the last time I had said in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting I feel that there are a lot of opportunities and possibilities.
I have many letters from citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I specially want to tell my young friends that on 15th August I had told Red Fort that why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is one of the reasons for corruption at the bottom level.
And on 15th August, I had said that I want to get rid of the tradition of interview below one level.
I am glad that it has been 15 days in such a short span of time but the government is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The information is being sent and nearly now the decision will be taken that small jobs will be missed due to the interview.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no exploitation, there will be no corruption.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the sake of health, especially for maternal mortality and infant mortality, 24 countries of the world have contemplated in the land of India for their action plan.
This is the first time outside the United States, this programme was held in another country.
And it is true that even today nearly 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die in our country at the time of and immediately after delivery.
This is worrying and scary.
Well the improvement is enough.
India has also started to appreciate at the international level, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers and save our newborn babies.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue keeps coming.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And it is directly related to what I am talking about clean India.
We see advertisation on GST but we do not pay any attention.
Advertisement is published in the newspaper but our attention is not paid.
There are ways of maintaining cleanliness in small things in the house with pure water.
There is widespread public education in these things, but we dont get attention and sometimes we feel that we live in a very good house, we have a very good system and we dont know that ourselves are full of water and somewhere we invite dengue.
I would urge all of you that we should not allow death to be so cheap.
Life is precious.
This is not right because of the ignorance of water, the apathy towards cleanliness and the cause of death.
Free screening facilities are available for dengue at about 514 centers across the country.
As soon as the time has come, it is useful to save lives and cooperation with all of you is very important.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, festivals are celebrated in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see, rituals will become a nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have a good news to tell you, I always say that we will not get the opportunity to die for the country but we have got the good fortune to live for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
In America, Race Across America is a ycle-race, it is very difficult, it has a race of about four thousand and eight hundred kilometers.
This year these two brothers won this race.
See how everyone is making efforts to pursue the country.
And this is what happens when you hear such incidents then the chest gets tired.
Occasionally, we do injustice to our youth due to exercise.
And the older generation always feels that the new generation has no understanding and I believe that this process has been going on for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, we also get to learn a lot.
I have met a number of youngsters who say, "Brother, I have taken a vow in my life on Sunday.
Some people say that I have kept a ycle-day in a week.
It is also good for my health.
And I also enjoy being young.
Nowadays cycling runs in many cities in our country too. There are many people who promote bicycles.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two youths of my country hoisted the flag in America, I like to mention the direction in which the youth of India thinks.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I enjoy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - the land of Indu Mill of Mumbai - the case had been pending for a long time to make his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has accomplished this task and now it will become the grand Divya Motivational Memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who will continue to inspire us to work for the oppressed, exploited and deprived section of the society.
But at the same time, where Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has now been purchased.
When Indians travelling all over the world will go to London then the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to build there will become our inspiration.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two efforts of honouring Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your thoughts before the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, because I believe that democracy runs with peoples participation.
The country can move forward only by joining shoulder to shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely get help in sowing kharif.
And I've had a pleasure in my mind and I've had a great pleasure.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should have pulses, vegetables and some oil for their food.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this. I congratulate them very much.
My dear countrymen, July 26 is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much from the land as from the country's youth.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was overwhelmed by hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who have failed their enemies for centuries, regardless of their lives.
Kargil war was not fought on the borders only, in every city of India, in every village, it contributed to this war.
This war was fought for those mothers, those sisters whose young sons or brothers were fighting enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, the henna of the pearl did not land.
And therefore, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all our fighters.
On 26th July, in one more way, I consider myself very important because in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on 26th July.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, to connect people with development and today I am happy to say this thing after a year that nearly two crore people have seen MyGov.
Around 5. 5 lakh people made comments. And it is a matter of great happiness that more than fifty thousand people gave suggestions on PM applications, they took time out, Mindapply, this work was considered important.
Now the matter is small, but no one has ever noticed this in the government, nor has it ever been thought of.
But on the suggestion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government seriously considered it and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, those people who are made, tag lines, programmes are created, policy is created, very positive suggestions are made on MyGov.
A new fresh air experience is experienced in the governance system.
There is a new consciousness experience.
These days, I have also been receiving suggestions on MyGov, what should I say on 15th August
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Speaking on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this has given me an idea, what should I say on August 15 this time, can you send me suggestions
You can send letters to MyGov, write letters on All India Radio, write letters in the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on 15th August should be suggested by the people.
I am sure you will send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I do not want to preach nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibilities of the units of state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I glanced at the scene of an accident in Delhi and the scooter driver was suffering for 10 minutes after the accident.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people keep writing to me continuously on the point that you should say something on road safety.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Amey Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidri of Karnataka.
And when you look at the statistics, the heart moves.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
An accident causes a death every 4 minutes due to road accident.
And the biggest concern is that about one-third of those who die are young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years and one death shakes the entire family.
The government should do whatever it should be required to do, however, I appeal to my parents, to my children whether it is two-wheeler or running four-wheeler, the atmosphere of concentration should also be increased in the family.
One more project is for us, it is going to be expanded in the future, it is going to be expanded in the future, it is going to be expanded in terms of Washles Treatment, Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon, Mondiya highways, we are giving priority to an ashles treatment.
In order to provide information about the accidents across the country, toll-free number 1033, ambulance system, all these things, but all these things have been done after the accident.
We all really are very dear to know that one life is very sweet and one life is very dear, it needs to be seen in that form.
Sometimes I say, become an employee.
Some incidents have come to my mind in the past, I like to talk to you, sometimes a person gets tired of working and sometimes he gets tired of doing his job.
I was very pleased to see this great example of how life can be brought to my work.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his ability can be linked to his work.
Perhaps Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And one more thing came to my mind - the entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started a work that touched my heart and I like it very much.
He started Operation Malayalam - now this is someone, listening to it, it will look like something else.
See, the meaning of Raksha Bandhan has changed. I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes these small things enjoy my heart and so I am sharing it with you.
There is a small village in Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to construct toilets for the last few months.
And now no one in that village has to go to the open defecation.
They did this, but, when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated a big festival like this.
These are the best examples of how the society is changing the values of life, how the minds of the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing to Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, regarding the questions of North-East.
However, the people of Northeast are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
But today I would like to tell them that there is a separate ministry for the North-East.
They will go to the districts, they will visit the villages, they will meet the local government officials, they will talk to the people's representatives, they will talk to the citizens.
You will listen to the problems, you will also do whatever the government of India has to do in the direction of solving the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And the officers who visit this place feel that how beautiful the state, how good people, now they have to develop this area and they have to solve their problems.
If you return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is to move from Delhi to Far East, which I am saying Act East Policy, this is the act.
My dear countrymen, we all take pride in the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes this idea comes, if we talk to the younger generation today and ask them what you want to be ahead then one or half of the 100 students will be found who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern that the trend towards science is low.
There is a great need to take an interest in innovation, get encouragement and know their capabilities.
I would also like to tell the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone ahead by reading so much, then you should also visit some school and college near you for two-four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience and your strength will certainly be of use to this new generation.
The work is difficult, but to do it.
We have started this and in the coming years, we will provide 24x7 electricity to our villages.
If the children of the village also have to study during the examination days then there should not be any problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then electricity will be obtained.
Today even if you have to charge mobile phones then you have to go to other villages.
The villages should get the benefits that the cities get.
And that is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
I know that such a big country, lakhs of villages have to reach far and wide, we have to reach every house.
But, it's only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, I felt like talking about different things.
In a way, our country has the opportunity to celebrate the month of August, the month of September.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to you all.
Must send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be of great use to me.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had requested you people that if you go anywhere during the holidays and if there is a memorable picture of that place then it will be incredible.
When I said it, I didn't think it would be a tremendous result.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter pay, Facebook pay, Instagram.
I can say that India is full of so many diversities.
Be it architectural, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers or sea.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big thing that you people have done.
And I also felt so much that I had re-tweeted him.
The world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see this thing.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but the person within me sometimes loses himself from all other dignitaries.
June 21st, International Day of Yoga I can say that my mind was stirred in the same way as I had put this topic in the NCER.
We can claim that the sun never falls in the world of yoga practitioners.
The way the world has honoured Yoga by laying a blind eye, the way the whole world has raised it on its shoulders, who will not be proud of it
The mind got overwhelmed.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean River and the Fiel Tower are a very glorious symbol, they chose that place to do yoga, they gave a place of equality.
People in New York performed Yoga on Times Sure.
It is a matter of Australia and Sydney that the image of the Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia kept Yoga at the same time as the Opera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milans Eumo Cathedral, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, NPEC-Kepping Force has also performed well in the field of Yoga.
In India too, our soldiers were performing Yoga on Siachen, white ice sheets, while Yoga programmes were organised around the sea by the Navy, wherever our naval ships were there.
Delhi has recorded its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogpath.
I am grateful to the country and the world from the bottom of my heart. And I can say that this was not a programme of fate.
It seemed as if a new curiosity, a new joy, a new excitement, a new engagement from every corner of the world.
A few days ago, when a family from Vietnam had tweeted a photo while doing a small child's yoga, that photo was so dear, it became so popular all over the world.
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, every village, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody who is
Yoga became a reason to connect the world in the true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is eager to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the legacy of this place, the world wants to know.
It is the responsibility of all of us to share this legacy of ours, the world and the world with us.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our legacy.
Sometimes we are so familiar that we feel that what is new in our things, what is new in it, like our family values, we dont know that Indias family values are a big thing for the world.
I'm sure it would be amazing.
There are so many things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to the best.
The success of International Day of Yoga has brought a new responsibility with joy and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the best yoga teachers to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from the world through a platform.
Institutions related to yoga should be introduced, knowledge of yoga gurus, knowledge about yoga.
If you want to learn Yoga then where can you learn Yoga, if you want a Yoga teacher then you should get it, you should prepare a database and I believe that you can do it.
Come, let's start something from somewhere. This will also become a new force.
In the last few days, we have seen the results of the work done by the government, the running government, once a target is set, we have seen this thing in the past few days.
And when there was despair all around, we should not forget that a year ago only one voice was heard all around, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government and sometimes no one pays attention to it.
In 2-5 years, if a small news comes to the newspaper sometime or the other, then come so much. In one corner, a small department, but he leads Yoga Day.
And the small departments in the world have done such a great job.
If the goal is in front then the small unit also works so well, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved people from Yemen.
Within hours, the people of India had reached Nepal to help Nepal. When the working government had to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank, the people of all the banks had come to the ground and in a short while they had connected millions and millions of people with the bank.
On 15th August, I had appealed for toilets in schools from Red Fort and I had said that we have to complete this work by next 15th August.
The work that could not be completed in 60 years was a courage to invoke in a year, about 4. 5 lakh toilets were constructed but today I can say with satisfaction that the delay in the arrival of 15th August is not yet complete, however, people have completed the work of constructing toilets in almost every school.
It means that the government, people, government officials, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month we had launched three public safety schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short time.
Very little work has been done in terms of public safety in India but due to these three schemes we are putting up a massive jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people but we have to move forward.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a huge gift.
Let us all strive to fulfil this resolution by working with me.
When I talk about mind, many people also send suggestions to me.
This time, I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that you must tell me something about the mind for the monsoon.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also be enjoying hot pakodas, bhajiye, corn as well as tea in the rain.
But along with the way the sun rays give life, the same rain gives strength to our lives.
The water of the village should remain in the village, the water of the city should remain in the city, it should be our resolution and efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if it returns to the land and recharges the land then problems of the year are solved.
I always tell the people that if you visit Porbandar in Gujarat and visit the house of Mahatma Gandhi then there is a tank inside his house two hundred years old in which rain water was provided directly to him.
Porbandar is on the beach but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water.
We can also do it.
In this rainy season, plantation of trees, plantation of trees should be done by social organizations and by the youth in a big way.
And I give you a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a very successful experience.
This is my entire rural technology.
When you plant the plant, put an old soil pot in the side of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill water twice a month, it will also run.
I keep telling the farmers to plant trees instead of fencing on the banks of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days the diseases spread a lot.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment bacteria start flourishing and for this cleanliness becomes very important and cleanliness becomes very important.
The urgency to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of care we do will stay away from us.
Water should be there, rain should also be there but one should also avoid illness.
Ladies and Gentlemen, just now we have launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have launched a massive campaign to make our cities liveable.
In the same way, such a country should also be able to equalize the world.
And on the other hand, the poorest of the poor of the country should have their own house to live in the country and the house should have electricity, water, toilets and schools to read nearby.
In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
We have started a big scheme with these three things.
I am confident that all these schemes will be helpful in bringing about changes in urban life.
I myself have been associated with you all through social media. Many new ideas keep meeting me with you people. I also get good information regarding the government.
But sometimes even a person sitting in a remote village touches our hearts.
You know that a daughter Bachao-Beti Teacho program is going on by the government.
But when the government's programme makes a person, society and village his strength increases.
In the past, Sunil Jaglan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana took a very interesting initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrying.
The highest in Haryana.
But when the Sarpanch of a small village of Haryana will turn the daughter-in-law Bachao Abhiyan into such a turning point then the mind is very happy and a new hope is awakened.
Therefore, I express my happiness.
However, this incident has inspired me. Therefore, I also urge you to post your selfie with your daughter and daughter.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao with her, you will write a tagline that will strengthen this idea, you will write a fine line, you can do it in any language, be it English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any language.
The most inspiring tagline I will be from Selfie to your daughter and I will retweet you.
In a way, we can convert this thing into a mass movement by teaching Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
The work that was started by Bhai Sunil from Bibipur village of Haryana and all of us should march ahead together and I urge you to post your selfiewithdaughter.
So my best wishes to you all in this rain, enjoy the rain.
Make our country greener.
You will continue to practice Yoga not for one day on International Yoga Day.
You see, you'll see the benefit.
Make it a part of your life, do it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, you must send photos.
The country and the world will know how diversity our country has.
One thought that there was very little in relation to handicraft.
We have to reach out to the world, we have to spread the specialties of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we will definitely reach.
My dear countrymen, this is all that I will meet next time for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
In a lighter atmosphere, 130 crore Indians used to listen and repeat a lot of things as a family member. Sometimes their own things became an inspiration for themselves.
You can imagine how the middle era must have been.
Perhaps, it wasn't a live program
This programme had a vibrant character, affinity, an attachment to the mind, an attachment to the hearts, and because of this thing, the time between the two was very difficult for me.
I was missing a few moments every moment and when I speak of the mind, I may say, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the power is yours, the bravery is yours.
was feeling an emptiness
But this Sunday has made a lot of waiting
Well, we've got a chance.
Several messages have come in the last few months in which people said they ' re missing the mind ' s point .
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the universe .
This is my journey from age to age .
My silent dialogue with you for me was in a way a part of my experience of spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath
Most people have drawn political meaning from it
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell you other things today but I will certainly do this thing that the emptiness that was due to this comfort of Mann Ki Baat, in Kedar valley, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given an opportunity to fill up something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I ' ll discuss it sometimes .
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your effort to emphasize a positive thing, I feel constant in your words.
The letters and inputs received for the matter of mind are completely different from the official functioning.
In a way your letter sometimes becomes a source of inspiration for me and sometimes becomes a cause for energy .
Sometimes my thought process can be sharpened by some words .
If people keep the challenges facing the country and society in front of them, they also give solutions.
If someone writes for hygiene then he is expressing his displeasure towards filth but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness .
If someone talks about the environment then he feels pain, but at the same time he also tells about the experiments he has seen and the imaginations he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
There is a need to include those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities and to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also indicates that all the 130 crore Indians want to join in the progress of the country with vigour and vigour. And I would like to say one thing that so many letters come to me in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls come and so many messages are received but the element of the complaint is very small and someone has asked for something, he has asked for something for himself, one such thing has not come to my mind in the last five years.
When I analysis these things you can imagine how much my heart will enjoy, how much energy I will get
Actually I haven't come - you have brought me, you have settled me and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling , let ' s go ahead with the talk of mind .
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to political realms, it was not confined to politicians, the movement was not confined to prison bars.
In the Emergency, every citizen of the country began to feel that he had been stripped of something.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the massive election campaign, the richest of the poor in our country, all of them were happily looking forward to deciding the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance and its amazing facts are also ignored.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people cast their votes.
This number may seem very ordinary to us but if according to the world I say if we leave China then in India more than the population of any country in the world had voted.
The number of voters who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double the number of voters.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of entire Europe .
It introduces the vastness and vastness of our democracy .
2019 Lok Sabha election was the worlds largest democratic election in history
You can imagine how big resources and manpower would have been needed in conducting such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff worked hard day and night to make elections possible
Nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their obligations to successfully conclude this great sacrifice of democracy, the same number of policemen from different states also worked hard.
As a result of the hard work of these people this time more than last time voting took place
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big archery you can imagine.
All this was done to ensure that no voter is denied his franchise
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a polling station was created for a female voter.
Polling station at the highest altitude in the world is also in India
The polling station is located at an altitude of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is another fact that is proud in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The voting percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact about this is that a record 78 women MPs are in Parliament today.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the electoral process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, many times you must have heard from my mouth, Book No Book, I urged that we can give books instead of flowers in the reception.
Since then , people have started giving books to a large extent .
However, I could not find much time, but during my stay I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again
His stories embodied the spirit of the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of intoxication written by him, my mind went on its own to the economic disparities prevailing in the society.
This story of Bir of the landlord's son Ishwari and the poor family learns that if you are not careful then when the effect of bad companion gets affected, I don't know.
The second story, which touched my heart, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, the pure love for his grandmother, so much mature at that young age.
4-5 years old Hamid reaches his grandmother with a tongue from the fair, in fact, human sensitivity reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a great truth of life, child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina, girl Amina.
One such great poignant story is the night of pus
The story showed a lively depiction of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life .
Even after destroying its crop, the Haldu farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter.
Though these stories are about a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading these, I had a different kind of feeling
When it comes to reading, in a media, I was reading about the Akshara Library in Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated in the thick forests of Idukki .
PK Muralidharan, the elementary school teacher and PV Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling the bundle and loading it on the back
Today, this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this book reading campaign .
In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, I would urge you to take some time out and place the book in your daily route.
You will truly enjoy a lot and write about whatever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat can know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about those issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the NarendraModi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belagavi's Pawan Gaurai, Bhubaneswar's Sitanshu Mohan Parida, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about the challenges related to water.
Water is of great importance in our culture .
Like your mother , that is , your blessings . Keep showering your blessings on us .
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received from rain in a year is saved in our country.
I believe that just like other problems, we will solve this crisis with the help of peoples participation, manpower and the strength, cooperation and determination of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen.
Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country keeping the importance of water paramount
This will enable speedy decisions on all matters related to water .
A few days ago I tried to do something different .
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs across the country to the village head
I wrote to the Gram Pradhans that to save water, to store water, to save drops of rain water, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and discuss with the villagers.
I am glad that they have shown full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month millions of people have performed Shramdaan in thousands of Panchayats
People in the village pledged to store every drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
Listen, what is the message given by the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katakamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas
People there, once again are ready to play their active role in water conservation
My best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, to all the Sarpanches for this activity.
There are many sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation
In a way it has become an opportunity for the entire village .
It seems that the people of the village are now in the race to build a water temple in their village.
As I said, collective efforts can yield great positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country .
Efforts are being made in different ways and in different parts of the country for this.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that's to save water, water conservation
Correction of train lines in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
Construction of tank in Thimmaipalli in Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, a big change has been brought about by the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women came together to revive Nag river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well together on rainwater harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we unite and strive hard, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will join, water will survive
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I request 3 requests from my countrymen
My first request is to make Swachhata a peoples movement, just like the people of our country have made it a mass movement, initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Together, let us resolve to save every drop of water. And I believe that water is God's Prasad, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier it was said that the touch of Paras makes iron gold .
I say, the water is Paras and from Paras, by the touch of water, the new life is created
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Explain about water related problems in it, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I particularly urge people from different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is film industry, sports, media friends, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, people who narrate the story, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake the society, join society, join society
You see, we will see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that in our country many traditional methods of water conservation have been being used for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar and the place of birth of revered Bapu, then there is a second house behind the house of revered Bapu. There is a water storage tank of 200 years old.
Let us connect with water conservation and motivate people to conserve water by making a list of more and more ways.
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShakti hashtags
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude and gratitude to the people of the world for one more thing.
On 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, with the activism, zeal and enthusiasm, three or four generations of each family came together to celebrate Yoga Day.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care is increasing the importance of Yoga Day.
Everyone, every corner of the world, if a Yoga lover welcomes him as soon as the sun sets then it is a complete journey of sunset.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from air-force to aircraft carriers, from A gyms to the ascetic desert, from villages to cities, not only was Yoga done but it was also collectively celebrated.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a happy family.
We all know that a healthy society requires healthy and sensitive individuals and Yoga ensures this.
Therefore propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service .
Should not such a service be recognized and honored
The announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me in itself.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have made significant contributions in the promotion of Yoga .
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roi of Italy who started Sarva Yoga International and spread yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in itself .
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind in it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honoured. For decades, Yoga has been dedicated.
Connecting to your thoughts is a very important journey for me .
Let's keep meeting, keep talking.
Keep listening to your feelings, keep alive, keep understanding
Sometimes I try to live those feelings
Stay your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the mind and keep the responsibilities of life.
Then meet again next month for Mann Ki Baat
Thank you very much to all of you
This season is also of heat on one side, and there is happiness somewhere.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
I have organised a special one-hour programme and I have seen that it was not just a programme of evils of the government, it was a matter of concern and I believe that in a way there was a lot of difficulty in getting out of the problem and due to that an atmosphere of good deliberation has started, the responsibility of the government has also been sensitized, they feel that they cannot remain indifferent.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
This is the money of drugs if they go to terrorists
If the terrorists buy weapons from these money
And with those weapons a terrorist will shoot bullets in the chest of my country's soldiers
My country's young man will be martyred
Have you ever thought that the one who killed a mother's red, the life-loving mother of India, the one who lives and dies for the country, has been shot in the chest of a soldier or not
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their secular progress with our children
Modi ji, you are not tired
A month is very long .
Many incidents happen in the country and the world .
You all celebrated Diwali with zeal and enthusiasm .
Festivals are celebrated from time to time, be it poor or rich, be it villages or cities, everybody has their own significance in life.
Sometimes they think that quit, people are useless, people have nothing to do. Our country is like that.
It is very important for me to change the thinking of the past and today I say this thing in my mind that our country is not like that.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead, the governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps even the governments need to change their mindset .
And that is why I am saying that these young people are specially committed to doing something or the other. They are looking for opportunities.
and doing it in its own way .
Last time I said, buy at least one khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become Khadi - holders . But I came to know from Khadi - stores that in a week there was an increase in sales of nearly 125 per cent Hundred and Twenty - five per cent .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in one week from 2 October as compared to the previous year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the people of India .
Cleanliness. One can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of a mass movement.
There are plenty of expectations and should also be.
And I can see a good result. Cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
One of the old filth, which is dirty, is a government machinery. What will the people sitting in the government take for it
It ' s a big challenge , but you can ' t run away from responsibility .
All the governments have to take steps for this responsibility by all municipalities as the pressure of the people is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect which is very exciting, joyous and satisfying to the mind is that the common man is beginning to feel that let's quit the past, now we will not filth.
We ' re not going to add to the new filth .
I am a member of Satna, Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bharat Gupta, who has sent a mail to my mygov.
He was going to his railway. He said his own experience of going to the railway. He said that he used to go to the railway before, this time also he went to the railway but I see that every passenger in the railway, people keep eating and drinking in the railway, keep throwing paper. Nobody throws, not only that, they used to find that there is dustbin somewhere in the compartment, put garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no system in the railways , he himself collected the garbage in the corner .
He said , It was a pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharatji for communicating this information to me .
But I am seeing that the biggest impact has been seen in small kids.
Hundreds of families refer to the fact that if our child eats chocolate somewhere then he immediately picks up the paper .
I just saw someone in one . social media that . . someone wrote . . My hero today and in today 's hero hero he gave a picture of a child .
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country will not be dirty.
We ' re not gonna be filthy .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, they immediately get somebody to stop them.
I consider it auspicious sign .
One good thing is also happening that people from all walks of life meet me these days.
Someone talks about cleanliness, someone talks about education, someone talks about social reforms.
Someone is discussing the loss of our family life .
I think , otherwise , if a merchant comes first , he will talk to the Government of his own interests .
But I see a big change .
They talk less about their selfish interests, they talk more about taking some responsibility related to society.
These are the things that I see by adding, so I can notice that we are moving forward in the direction of a very good change.
If a poor family of mine is not ill , there will never be any financial crisis in his life .
If he is healthy, he will work hard, earn and run his family.
And so my hygiene is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we can serve the poor better or not, whether we do not do dirt or not, the poor will be benefitted.
However , I have seen that those who are working in this field are sending me their success stories .
But I found out two things from my Government .
After my advice the officers of H . . . ministry who were officers felt that we should also do something .
And the officers made a plan together .
See how the changes in government are initiated .
One, he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give special scholarships to such a thousand good specialty-Abeld children by enlisting them.
I congratulate all these officers of the department for their ideas .
I had the opportunity to visit Siachen recently .
I spent Diwali in the midst of the dead soldiers for the country .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because because of them we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them.
I have experienced the hardships they spend their lives.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have another pride to say .
The soldiers of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamities nobody dares to defend us by putting a bet on life .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity to felicitate the young students, youngsters and youngsters from our country who had come here as a winner in sports.
I got a new energy .
Their enthusiasm, excitement, I was seeing that our facilities and facilities are very low compared to other countries but they were talking about doing something more excited and enthusiastic than complaining.
In itself, tea-drinking programme was a great inspiration for me, for these players.
One thing I want to say to my countrymen, and I really want to say it to my mind.
And I believe that the countrymen trust my words and trust my intentions.
But once again , I would like to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your Prime Servant, it is an article of Fath for me.
The money that has gone out of the poor of India should come back, it is my commitment.
There can be differences of opinion regarding the path and the method.
And democracy is natural , but on the basis of my understanding and knowledge I have , I assure you that we are on the right track .
Today no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, neither the previous government knew how much money was outside.
Everyone keeps telling different figures in their own way.
I dont want to engage in those figures, my commitment is two rupees, five rupees, crores, billions, billions and billions. This is the money of the poor people of the country, it should come back.
And I assure you , there will be no shortage of efforts .
No action will be taken .
Just make me bless you.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do, I will definitely do it.
I assure you of this .
I have received a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even though I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this feeling.
He has asked me to discuss this matter with your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I will talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss this addiction, this drug, this drug mafia and the kind of crisis that can cause India's youthful wealth.
If you have some experience in this matter, you must have some information, if you have saved the addictive children, if you have some methods of saving them, if any government officer has played a good role, if you give me such information then I will bring to the countrymen these good efforts and we will create an atmosphere in every family that no child should go on this path due to frustration, we will definitely discuss this in detail.
I know that I am handling matters in which the Government first comes to the dock .
But how long will we keep things hidden
I ' m also daring . Because of your love .
With your blessings , I shall continue to do so .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that please give us suggestions, give them on face book, give them on Twitter, send e-mails.
But there are very large sections of the country who dont have this.
Your point is correct .
They don ' t have this facility .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then you listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will also send a letter to me, the matter of mind, the All India Radio, the Parliament Road, New Delhi, if you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because active citizens are the biggest capital of development.
You write a letter, I mean you're very active.
For my mind's sake, your mind should also be linked.
You might surely write a letter .
I'll try, then talk to you next month.
I will try, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I ' m increasingly facilitating access to you .
Slowly it is getting cold .
It is a very good season for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
My best wishes to you all on Vijayadashami.
I will try, if possible, I would like to talk to you twice a month by taking out time once a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and the time will be at 11 a.m. then you will also be comfortable and I will also be satisfied that I have been successful in conveying my thoughts to you.
The festival of Vijayadashmi, which celebrates the festival of Vijayadashmi today, is a festival of victory of good over evils.
But a gentleman from Mumbai, Mr. Ganesh Venkatadari, sent me a mail, he said that in Vijayadashmi, we should resolve to eliminate the ten evils inside us.
I express my gratitude to him for this suggestion.
Everyone must have thought of defeating as many evils as they can, but as a nation, I feel that on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashmi, all of us should take a pledge to get rid of the filth and overcome the filth, we can make this pledge on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will upload their video in social media while cleaning themselves and they will invite nine more people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi comes in very natural attention.
You know, our own scientists have successfully used to reach Mars at the least cost, successfully.
There is no shortage of strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
I always miss one thing that Swami Vivekananda ji used to say, Swami Vivekananda always used to say one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up.
He said hey, what are you doing
You're a lion.
They have made me big.
Look at my voice, see my way of conversation.
So the lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as you awakened self-esteem from within, he got his own identity, like that lion, the lion among the sheep also started roaming.
The substance within him got awakened.
Swami Vivekanand ji used to say this.
My countrymen, 1. 25 billion Indians have immense power and immense potential.
We need to recognize ourselves.
We need to recognise the strength within us and as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, if we move ahead with that self-respect and with our right identity then we will be victorious and our nation will be victorious.
I spent two hours with him, perhaps he was a very emotional and inspiring event of my life.
God has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the whole nation.
Later, so much I was emotionally touched that I used to do separate Olympics for special Abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come and I used to go there myself.
And that is why I liked Gautam Pal's suggestions, which he gave me. And I felt that I should share with you the suggestions I have received.
A story brings me more attention.
You knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we pledge to walk, we will not stand by ourselves.
We will not be able to catch the finger and run.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that 1. 25 billion people are capable of walking and will continue to walk.
Many suggestions that come to me for a few days, people send big interesting suggestions.
Some people have told me that when they start small scale industries, the process of registration of them should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have written to me and sent them to teach skill development from the fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be dust beans within every hundred meters, if you have to arrange for cleanliness.
Some people have sent me by writing that polyethylene pack should be banned.
People are sending me a lot of suggestions.
I would like to tell you from now on that if you send me a true event, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if you send me with proof of such true events then I will definitely talk about my mind, I will certainly bring the things that have touched my mind to the countrymen.
Come, let us all work together to serve our Mother India.
We should take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came to my mind today.
Then when I will meet on Sunday, I will meet at 11 a.m. but I believe that our journey will continue, your love will remain.
If you want to say something to me after listening to me, of course, deliver me, I will like it.
I liked it very much today that I can reach far and wide by talking to you all and using radio.
I will reach out to the poorest of the poor households because my country's strength is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and the youth, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
With your trust, the country will move forward.
I express my confidence.
I believe in your power, so I believe in the future of India.
Starting the mind today is full of mind
Ten days ago, India and Mother lost their brave sons
These brave heroes, we spent ourselves in the defense of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Therefore, these brave sons had kept them together day and night so that the countrymen could sleep in peace.
In Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, there is a trauma and resentment in the minds of people across the country and in the minds of people.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families, all around
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives in the defense of Mother India.
The challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget racism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive than ever before.
Our Armed Forces have always been introducing unique courage and valour .
For the establishment of peace , where they have shown wonderful ability , the same attackers have also responded in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
Army has taken a pledge to destroy terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring words of his family through the media have further strengthened the frenzy of the country.
Ramniranjan ji, the father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all to know the zeal that has been introduced in this hour of grief.
They said that they would send their second son to fight against the enemies , and if necessary , they would fight themselves .
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha
He has vowed to get his only son to join the CRPF.
When the body of Martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in a tricolor reached Gumla in Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I too will go to the army
The repentance of this innocent manifests the feelings of the children of India today.
Similar feelings, our brave and valiant martyrs are being seen in every household
One of our brave martyrs is not an exception, his family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would request the younger generation to know and understand the sentiments and sentiments shown by these families.
What is patriotism, what is sacrifice and penance, we will not need to move towards the old events of history.
In front of our eyes, these are living examples and this is the reason for inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that was waiting for us for so long after independence is going to end now.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen is very natural about this.
Udupi on NarendraModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty Ji of Karnataka expressed his happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised and painful that there was no National War Memorial in India .
A memorial where stories of brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be such a memorial in the country.
We decided to construct the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i. e.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
A new memorial has been built just near the heart of Delhi where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present.
I am sure this National Military Memorial will be like going to a place of pilgrimage for the countrymen .
The National Military Memorial symbolizes the gratitude of the nation to the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice since independence.
The design of the memorial shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers
The concept of the National Military Memorial focuses on four concentration circles, which depicts the journey from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
The flame of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second circle is the gallantry cycle that shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
It's a gallery where the bravery of the soldiers on the walls is engraved
Next, the sacrifice cycle demonstrates the sacrifices of the circle soldiers
In this the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters
After this the protector cycle displays the security
This circle has a line of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and convey to the citizens of the country the message that every guard is stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe .
Overall, the National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude and research on them.
Here is the story of those sacrifices who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can survive so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express in words the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary Forces in the development of the country.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to those men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go, share your pictures on social media so that other people get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, thousands of your letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat keep me reading through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comment I received a very interesting comment from Ashish Mukhopadhyay ji .
He has written that on March 3, 1900, when the British had arrested Birsa Munda, his age was only 25 years old. It is a coincidence that Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also on March 3.
And he further writes that these two personalities are entirely from two different family backgrounds that enrich the heritage and history of Jharkhand .
In a way , paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand .
These two great personalities have enhanced the name of Jharkhand not the whole country .
The whole country is grateful for their contribution .
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality to guide, then it is Lord Birsa Munda
The British had secretly caught them very cleverly when they were asleep .
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action
Because the British who built such a big empire were also afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had shaken the British rule equipped with guns and cannons only with his traditional arrows.
Actually, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people is overwhelming on the power of weapons.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom from the British but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the dark life of the deprived and the exploited, the sun shines like a sun
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 years
Birsa Munda is the son of Mother India, every part of the country.
Perhaps some corner of India would be such that no one has contributed in this war of freedom that lasted for centuries.
But unfortunately the stories of their sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation
If, a personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize our existence, a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country big institutions
Jamshedji Tata was truly a visionary who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is necessary for the future.
Not only that he established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries too .
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 29.
As you all know , it comes only once in 4 years .
Intuitive, peaceful personality rich, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country
Morarji Bhai Desai ' s name is the record to present the most budget in independent India .
Morarji Desai led India in a difficult time when there was a threat to democratic fabric of the country
Morarji Bhai Desai struck himself in the movement against Emergency to protect democracy
For this, he had to pay a heavy price even in old age .
The then government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
44th Constitutional Amendment was introduced during his tenure
This is important because the 42nd Amendment brought in during the Emergency, which included the reduction of the powers of the Supreme Court and other provisions that violated our democratic values - was restored.
Like the provision of publication in newspapers of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies through the 44th Amendment
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in this amendment also it was made that the fundamental-officers found under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time such arrangements were made that the President will announce the Emergency on the written recommendation of the Cabinet and it was also decided that the period of Emergency cannot be extended for more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that by implementing the Emergency, the manner in which democracy was murdered in 1975 could not be repeated in the future.
Generations to come will always remember his invaluable contribution in sustaining the glory of Indian democracy
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma awards.
Today, we are moving towards a New India. In this, we want to respect those people who are doing their work in a dull manner on grass-root level.
Through their hard work they are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways
Indeed, he is a true Karmayogi, who is selfless in public service, social service and above all in the service of the nation.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I consider it a great success because these are the people who are not on the T.., Magaine or the front page of the newspapers.
These are far from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their names just believe in working at the grassroots level
Yoga : Karmasu Kaushalam lives the message of the Gita in a way
I want to tell you about a few people like this .
You must have heard of Odisha's divine heroes. They are not called "anal Man of the Disha". The divine hero cut the mountains in his village with his own hands and made the path of the canal for three kilometers.
Take Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did wonderful work to revive the traditional Rogan painting of Kutch.
They ' re doing a great job to bring this rare painting to the new generation .
The Tree of Lie Artwork created by Abdul Gafoor was gifted to former US President Barack Obama .
Among the recipients of the Padma awards , Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata .
The way he spent his entire life in the service of the goddess is unique in itself .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first attempted to empower the victims and exploited through the Kalanjim movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated a community based small financial system.
Even at the age of 100, he is training yoga to people around the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers
Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Hady Taran in Jharkhand, did the bold work of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites, not only saved 50 hectares of forest degradation but also motivated ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is the glory of Jamuna ji's hard work that today villagers plant 18 trees on the birth of every child and 10 trees on the marriage of a girl.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, despite being a Divya himself, it is difficult to get an example of the work done for the upliftment of Divya women by establishing an institution called Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the noble work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of the farmer aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, i.e. the story of Princess Devi is very inspiring.
He set an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable .
Kisan Aunt inspired 300 women from their area to make them self-reliant and financially self-reliant
He trained the women of the village along with cultivation and other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked to connect technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time it has happened that in the Padma awards given this year, 12 farmers have received the Padma awards.
Usually very few people associated with agriculture and very few people directly cultivating have come in the list of Padma Shri .
This is in itself a living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to talk to you all about the touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going, my effort is to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme PM-JAY or PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
He was treated with this scheme and he became healthy, the head of the house, the caretaker of his family by working hard and was unable to work. This scheme benefited him and he got healthy again and started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have availed the benefits of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change was taking place in the lives of the poor .
If all of you know any poor person who is unable to get treatment due to lack of money , tell him about the scheme .
Different education boards across the country will start the process for testing of boards of class  and II in the next few weeks
I extend my warm greetings to all the examiners, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago in Delhi a massive programme of Pariksha Pe Charcha was held at Town Hall Format.
One of the features of the discussion on the examination was the open discussion on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that can certainly be beneficial for the students
If all the students, their teachers and parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube, then I extend my best wishes to all the exam warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it is not possible to talk about India and the festival.
There is hardly any day in our country which does not have any significance, which does not have any festival.
because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture .
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, a special significance of it is covered in our temple.
He discussed a number of topics and his confidence was really impressive - inspiring
During the conversation when I was talking to an eminent young man, he said, I am stag artist, I am mimicry in entertainment programmes, so I asked him whose mimicry you do
So he told me that I do the mimicry of the prime minister
So I asked them to show me a little bit and it was a pleasant surprise for me. So they gave me the entire mimicry of the way I talk about Mann Ki Baat.
I like to hear that people not only listen to the mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really impressed by the power of that disabled youth .
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through the radio , I ' m going to meet millions of families every month .
Sometimes when you talk to all of you, read your letters or listening to the views sent on your phone, I feel that you have accepted me as a part of your family.
It has been a very pleasant feeling for me .
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in all the elections
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be held on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and throughout the month of May, all these three months of our feelings, after the election, with the power of your blessings with a new belief, I will once again start the process of our conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Sri Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji, the doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka was not amongst us
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us Kayakve Kailas i. e.
His reputation was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages .
He was a social reformer .
He devoted his whole life to finding food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge .
Be it the welfare of the farmers in every way, it was a priority in the life of Swami ji.
Siddhaganga Math regularly organised animal and agricultural fairs .
I have had the privilege of receiving the blessings of the supreme venerable Swami ji several times .
In 2007, our former President, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam went to Tumkur to commemorate the centenary year celebrations of Shri Shivkumar Swami ji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for revered Swami ji on this occasion .
On giving, you receive happiness Almithy will bless, all your actions. This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Sri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math beautifully.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
25th January was the Foundation Day of the Election Commission which is celebrated as National Voters Day.
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countryman to be proud of the Election Commission after seeing the good way our Election Commission organizes it .
In our country, no stone is left unturned to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, registered voter, gets the opportunity to vote.
When you listen to these things it is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission .
In view of that one voter, that voter gets the opportunity to exercise his franchise, the entire team of EC employees goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting and that is the essence of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also compliment the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel, other staff who participate in the polling process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century will use their vote in Lok Sabha elections.
They have had the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to be part of the decision making process in the country .
It is time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the young generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote simultaneously - this feeling must grow within us.
There should be great pain in life for any reason, if not able to vote
Sometimes there is something wrong in the country , it should be sad .
I urge the eminent personalities of the country to make people aware about the fact that we all have to collectively vote for a voter registration or voting day.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is Bahuratna-Vasundhara
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that within the Red Fort many such rooms, buildings had been closed since independence.
The closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into very beautiful museums.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history lies.
Things that narrate the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the museum's rocks inspire us to enter the history.
Col Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Maj Gen Shahnawaz Khan were sued by the British Government at this venue.
When I was seeing the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, in the Kranti Mandir, then the family members of Netaji presented me a very special cap, cap.
Sometimes Netaji used to wear the same hat
I kept that cap in the museum so that the people coming there could see the cap and take inspiration from him for patriotism.
In fact , the valour and patriotism of their heroes need to be continually conveyed to the new generation .
Just a month ago, on December 30, I visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
A tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a tradition on August 15.
This occasion was to complete 75 years of the formation of Azad Hind Government .
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organiser
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle .
Come to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with shining slogans
For many years it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this thing.
I remember that day when the whole family of Netaji came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we talked about Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Bose
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop several places associated with Indias great heroes in Delhi.
Whether it is Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or the Kranti Mandir
If you come to Delhi you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium of connecting with the people. Likewise, Netaji too had a deep connection with the radio and he had also chosen the radio to interact with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations also broadcast weekly news bulletins which were in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu etc.
Programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir .
This is an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner .
There are 4 historical hehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
The museum showcases excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Saloj Mukherjee.
And I would particularly urge you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji .
Now you might be wondering that there is talk of art here and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
You have so far known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician .
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his work .
He believed that the painting seer himself understood that painting, know the message given by him in the painting from his point of view.
Their paintings have been displayed in European countries, in Russia and in the USA.
I hope you will visit his paintings in the Kranti Mandir .
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions .
One such saint was - Sant Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on 19th February
The couplets of Sant Ravidas ji are very famous .
Sant Ravidas ji used to give a big message through a few lines
He said that there is a caste in the caste, which is the caste of Ketan, which can not be added to the caste, unless the caste is thrown out of the banana stem, then the leaf under the leaves and in the end nothing comes out, but the whole tree ends, in the same way human beings have been divided into castes and human beings have not been there.
They used to say that if God really is in every human being, then it is not fair to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas Ji through his messages tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained to the world the true meaning of the reputation of labour .
He used to say that if the mind is healed then in Kathauti Ganga means that if your mind and heart are sacred then God lives in your heart.
The messages of Sant Ravidas ji have influenced people from all walks of life be it the Maharaja of Chittor or the ueen of Chittor or Meerabai, all were his followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think beyond the skies in some ways - Kiran ji, I appreciate your idea and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the opportunity to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Numerous young scientists of the country have contributed in our space programme.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching out to space today.
Kalam set created by our students on 24th January has been launched
The sounding rockets built by university students in Odisha have also made many records .
In the last four years, the space mission has been started almost as much as the space mission has been started since independence in 2014.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using space technology to protect the lives of people.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technology is getting a lot of help in all these.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their security as well as economic growth.
We are using space technology to further improve the delivery and accountability of government services.
Housing for all i. e. nearly 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been geo-tagged under this scheme.
Along with this, about three and a half crore properties under MNREGA were also geo-tagged.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country .
It has contributed greatly to our better relations with many countries of the world .
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through its extremely competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
For children the sky and the stars are always very attractive .
Our Space Programme gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond those limits which were considered impossible so far.
It is a vision to keep watching stars for our children as well as motivate them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that all the youngsters and young sportspersons have come to the fore in Khelo India this time.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strong, that is, only when our base is strengthened will our youth be able to demonstrate the best of their capabilities in the country and around the world.
This time in Khelo India sportspersons from every state have performed well at their own level.
Life of many medal winners is a great inspiration .
They live in a parking shed with their family
Maharashtra's under-21 female kabaddi team captain Sonali is a resident of Helvi Satara
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted Sonali's skills
It is often seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi
Despite this Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed excellently
10 year old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner at Khelo India Youth Games
Akshata Baswani Kamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka wins gold medal in weightlifting
He credited his victory to his father, his father is a farmer in Belgaum
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is the resolve of youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India are telling that not only the people of big cities have contributed to the creation of New India but also the youth, young sporting talents coming from small towns and cities.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contests.
But have you heard about the toilet polishing contest
Hey, more than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in this unique contest running for nearly a month.
The name of this unique contact is clean beautiful toilet
People are making their toilets clean and colorful, paintings and beautiful by making them beautiful. You will also be able to see a lot of clean and beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I call upon all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in my Panchayat
Share your clean beautiful toilet photos with MylatGhar on social media
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and to make our country open defecation free.
With the support of the people of India today, India is poised to become Open Defecation Free much before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have contributed immensely in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat and that is why you are happy to share that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves as Open Defecation Free and sanitation coverage has crossed 98 in rural India and nearly nine crore households have been provided toilets.
My little friends, the days of examinations are going to come.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and am carriers
Anshul ji, thank you for raising this issue
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is Cam Season
From students, their parents to teachers, all the people are busy with the work related to the examinations.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this topic today in this programme of Mann Ki Baat but you would be happy to know that I am going to interact with students from all over the country in the Pariksha Pe Charcha Pariksha Pariyojana two days later on 29th January at 11.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in the event
In this examination, I will have a lot of discussions with my young friends on all aspects related to examinations, especially the stress free exams.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas for this.
And I am very happy that a large number of people on MyGov are sharing their views
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions in front of you during the Town Hall programme
You must be part of this program. You can also see its live telecast through social media and NAMO app.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock the whole country pays homage to the martyrs
We also pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes
Remember the virtue of revered Bapu and come forward with this resolution to realize the dreams of revered Bapu, to build a New India, to fulfill our duties as a citizen.
Successfully pursue this 2019 visit
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
This is where he showed his determination towards justice .
Today, I would like to say that one thing that touches my mind in the feedback of Mann Ki Baat, the maximum number of people said that when we listen to the mindset of the family sitting amongst all the people then it seems that the head of our family is sitting in the midst of us and sharing our own things with us. When I heard this thing widely, I was very satisfied that I am among you, I am among you, I am among you, you have made me bigger and in a way I will continue to join you as a member of your family, I will continue to associate with you your happiness, my happiness and sorrows, your aspirations, your ambitions, my ambitions, my ambitions, I thank you very much for this journey.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
