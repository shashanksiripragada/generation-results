Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only Indians participate in it.
Now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social movements there are also celebrating Diwali with full fervor and enthusiasm.
In a way, it can also be said that India is the country that is set up there.
Friends, there is an attraction of festival tourism in the world.
There are immense possibilities for festival tourism.
Whatever our efforts should be, we should showcase Holi, Deepavali, Onam, Pongal and Bihu.
In our country, in every state, in every region, there are various festivals, in which people from other countries are more proud.
Therefore, the participation of overseas Indians is crucial in expanding festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in the last Mann Ki Baat that we will do something different on Deepavali
We all had said that on this Deepawali, we will celebrate the women power and achievements of India, that is, we will respect the ladies of Indian origin.
Within a few days, there have been innumerable stories of inspiration in the social media.
Millionaire from the concession, Ramesh ji, on the Namo App, described his mother as his power.
In the year 1990, when my father was a time, my mother accepted the golden sustenance of five children.
Today, all five brothers are sitting in good work.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother too.
Next, Geetika Swami ji, who is very enthusiastic about Twitter, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the lord of India.
For Kavita Diwadi, if she is the daughter of India, she gives her strength.
It is a matter of great pride for the mother that her daughter is a beautiful painting.
He has also received good marks in the CLAT entrance examination.
People are sharing such information.
You must study, inspire and share something in your neighbourhood. On this occasion, I offer my respectful greetings to all the ladies and gentlemen of India.
We are aware that the foundation stone for this was laid by him in the 17th century itself.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November this year, the 550th birth anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev ji is spread all over the world not only in India but also in India.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world, who are fully dedicated to the noble cause of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget that I visited the Gurudwara in Venkuwar and Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji is going to share a lot of things about him, but this requires a lot of sections of Mann Ki Baat.
Nanak Dev ji was above all considered to be serving.
Guru Nanak Dev ji regarded selfless service as priceless.
He strongly voiced and acted against social evils such as untouchability.
The message of Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji spread all over the world.
He was one of those who travelled a lot in his time.
He went to many places and wherever he went he would win everyones hearts through his simplicity and devotion.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had undertaken several important religious journeys which are called Udasi.
He carried messages of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, in all directions, to the people of everywhere, to the saints and the saints.
It is believed that the famous Shanker Dev ji of Assam was also inspired by him.
He undertook a pilgrimage to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Devji had stayed in Gurubagh Gurudwara, a sacred place of Kashi.
He also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bihar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had found a solution to the water conservation there.
It reminds us all of us that a famous place named Guru Nanak Jeera Saheb is in Bihar, which was dedicated to him.
There was a time when Guru Nanak ji had travelled north, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
This led to a strong link between Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev ji went to Tibet and the people there accepted him as a guru.
He is also bowed down to Uzbekistan on his pilgrimage.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited Islamic countries in large numbers, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He also took place in the minds of millions of people, they followed his teachings with full devotion and are still following them.
A few days ago, government ambassadors from around 85 countries went from Delhi to Amritsar.
They visited the Golden uadrilateral and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
It is on this day that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, the iron man of India, was born, who connected the country to Orissa.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful talent to integrate the people, while he was capable of compromising those who had differences.
He's actually the man of Detail, the smartest to look at the nucleus.
Besides, he has expertise in organisational activities.
He had the art of planning and designing strategies.
While reading about Sardar ji's actions, we can understand how strong his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were to attend the 1921 congressional conference in Ahmedabad.
All the arrangements for the convention were imposed on Sardar Ji.
He used this opportunity to repair the city's drinking water network.
He asserted that water scarcity should not happen to anyone.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to do Khadi bags.
At the same time, substantial increase in khadi sales was also ensured.
Our country would have been grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He worked with great significance in deciding fundamental rights, thereby making no inequality based on caste and religion.
Friends, as the first Home Minister of the country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji had succeeded in unifying the princely states with a pen-writing and pen-writing effort in the books of history.
In fact, while we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we are only talking about his contribution towards certain areas of integration of the country.
As soon as Sardar Patel received this message, he did not delay a minute, but immediately took active action.
Under his orders, the tri-flood was immediately flew, and while he was watching, the enemy's evil desire to capture a million islands was dumped.
After this incident, Sardar Patel urged the brothers of Lakshadweep to ensure that all possible assistance is provided for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep has been contributing significantly to India's progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to commemorate Sardar Vyas.
This is the world's largest image.
This statue is two feet higher than the statue of independent Goddess in America.
Every Indian is proud of the world's tallest statue.
The head of every Indian stands with pride.
I am glad that more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the Statue of Unity in a year.
Thus, every day 8500 people have seen the glory of the Statue of Unity.
It is evident that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Chapatikalli Garden, Butterfly Gardens, Vandiperiyar, Child Nutrition Park, Unity Nursery etc. which have improved the economy of the region and are providing new opportunities for employment to the people.
Friends, for the country, for the tourism sector, this statue of unity can be a scientific thing.
We all are witnesses to how a place can become a world-renowned tourist destination within a year.
There are people from our country and from foreign countries.
Traffic, accommodation, guides and environment friendly organizations are developing each other.
You too, take a little time out of your precious time and visit the Statue of Unity.
But at the same time, I once again urge every Indian travelling with his family to visit at least 15 places in India and stay there at night.
Friends, you are aware that from 2014 onwards, 31st October is being celebrated as the day of national unity.
This day tells us the message to save the country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, every year, the Run for Unity is being organised.
This includes all sections of the society and all sections of the society.
In this way, this drive is being carried out not only for the body but also for the inner and friendly nature, for the unity of India and for India to touch new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel ji connected the country with the thread of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a friend in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we must add strength to this mantra of unity at every level, at every stage, at every step, at every step and at every step.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very productive and awakened to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around, we can see many examples of those who are engaged in sustainable work to promote mutual harmony.
But sometimes the effort of the society, its contribution, disappears very quickly from the memorial board.
Friends, I clearly remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the issue of Ramjanmabhoomi.
But after the verdict on the Ramadan land, the then government, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions, sages and priests gave a very soft and neutral expression.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure on the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duty.
This is an example of how the word unity gives strength to the nation.
Even the gods who benefit from it are 125 crore Indians.
But there is a pleasant experience and an interesting experience.
I heard why I felt that I should not share with you.
Just imagine... the world's tallest battlefield, with a temperature of 50-60 degrees below zero.
The air has some nominal form of oxygen.
In such an adverse situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is no less than a mighty act.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders but also running a clean Siachen movement.
I congratulate and thank the people of our country for this wonderful duty of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to swallow anything in the extreme cold of the area.
In such a scenario, it is very important to analyze and arrange garbage dumps.
If there is an ecosystem here then it is a place for rare animals like snowy slopes and rare animals like ipex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are the time to create a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on Deepawali, in particular, buying something new and bringing something from the market is happening in almost every family.
I had also once said that we should try to buy local items.
If we get the necessary things in our village then what is the need to go to the regional level
If one thing is available at the regional level then what is the need to go to the district level
As much as we are trying to buy locally available goods, Gandhi will automatically blossom into a great opportunity.
I repeat my request to buy something from the hand of our weavers, from the garments made by our weavers and those produced by our weavers.
Along with conveying the best wishes of Deepavali, I also urge you to turn into those who want to buy more local products.
We have to accomplish how important we can contribute to realizing the dreams of Gandhiji through this.
Once again I convey my best wishes for this Deepavali.
On Deepawali we burn a variety of firecrackers.
But sometimes it burns due to our lack of attention.
It's getting hurt.
Therefore, I urge you to preserve yourselves as well as to celebrate festivals.
My best wishes to you all on Diwali.
Thank you so much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and express his support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the valour festival of Bharakram Parv.
We were reminded of the precise attack in 2016, and our soldiers retaliated vigorously in the covert war that had been fought against our nation.
Our soldiers organised exhibitions at various locations across the country to showcase our strength to the citizens, particularly the youth of the country.
Look how eligible we are and how our soldiers risk their lives and protect our countrymen.
One day like the Mount Bharakram reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our soldiers.
And it inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, Veerbhumi Rajasthan.
Now it has been decided that our soldiers will give a strong response to those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development of our country.
India has always been with a sense of dedication and commitment to peace.
In the two world wars of the twentieth century, more than a lakh of our soldiers made their great sacrifice for peace, even if we had nothing to do with those wars.
This is also a mighty act of militarism in the direction of peace by our armed forces.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will always be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has drawn the attention of each and every citizen of the country by showing its capability in the sky.
They have given us a sense of security.
On the occasion of the Independence Day, Air Sahas is one of the most eager and keen expectations of the people in the march, in which our Air Force will showcase their strengths with desperate activities.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1932, our Air Force, which launched a small operation with six aircraft and 19 air warriors, is today one of the most adventurous and powerful Air Forces of the 21st century.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all air warriors and their families who are serving the nation.
In 1947, in an unexpected attack by Pakistanis, our air force decided to save Sri Lanka from the attackers, and landed the Indian Army's weapons and war equipment on the battlefield at the right time.
In 1965, the Air Force retaliated strongly against the enemy.
Who would not know about the 1971 Bangladesh Freedom Struggle
In the Tiger Hill area, everywhere the enemies were hiding, they rained in the night and shook the soil.
Whether it is rescue and relief operations or disaster management, the nation is grateful to the Air Force for the commendable efforts of our air warriors.
Their sense of hurricanes, floods and forest fires is extraordinary to deal with all calamities and to help the countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of their departments for women.
Now the women joining the Air Force become permanent in addition to their short term work and I had announced this thing from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
We can proudly say that not only the male power but also the role of female power is growing in the Indian Army's military forces.
Women are powerful, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, an officer from the Navy, Abilash Tomy, had faced the struggle of life and death.
The whole country was concerned about how to save Tommy.
You know, Abilash Tommy is a very adventurous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel in a small boat and travel worldwide, without any modern technology assistance.
For the past 80 days, he has been moving ahead without decreasing his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern Indian Ocean.
He was an extraordinary example of Sahasam, Consolation and Majesty, a few days ago, when I had rescued Abhilash from the sea and brought him out, I telephoned him.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the excellent health of Abilash Tomy. His courage, his might, his determination, the power of fighting and fighting will definitely inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country knows what is the significance of our country on 2nd October.
Another highlight is the 2nd October this year.
From now on, we have organized several programmes around the world to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Gandhijis ideas have inspired the entire world.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of the sacred brother.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some thoughts as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle was intensified in 1945, he prepared a compilation of those ideas.
He placed his views before the people of the country on a wide range of issues such as the protection of the rights of farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most unique form of his distinction.
He made every person feel that every person is very important and indispensable for the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle was to transform this into a mass struggle.
All sections of the society and all sections of the society took up the challenge of Gandhi Ji in the freedom struggle.
And the mother said, "I give you a coffee table, whenever you have doubts, you have this kind of measure, look at the person who is the poorest and the weakest. Look at his face and come back to his memory and ask your heart how much you will do.
Will his life and future brighten up
My dear countrymen, this shield of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the growing middle class people of the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
If we go to buy something then can we remember the breasts for a moment
Can you remember that safeguard from your brother
Whose face will rejoice
If you buy, who will be benefitted directly or indirectly
If the poorest of the poor gets a profit, my happiness will be many times more.
Remember this mantra of Gandhi Ji and when all of us buy something in the coming days, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, when we buy every item, when we buy every item, it is good for our countrymen, especially those who have studied their sweat to create this thing, those who have invested their money, those who have sown their capabilities, all of them should get some profit.
Even though he did not know how this would happen, but this happened, India got freedom.
Just like this, today we can feel that how this small task of mine can contribute in the economic development of my country, in the contribution of economic power and in the power of the poor to fight against their poverty.
But today this is the real patriotism, I believe this will be the charity we can offer to the brotherhood.
He said that all these gates are hard-wrenched, and every corner of them should be used.
And there was an admiration for the nation, and a love for the people of the land, and an admiration for every neighbour of the land.
We are going to celebrate Shastri's birthday with a sacred brother two days later.
His slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a symbol of his foresightedness.
As a result of his selfless commitment towards the nation, in less than one and a half years, he was able to give the mantra of achieving the peak of success to the soldiers and farmers of the country.
Crores of people joined this movement and I got an opportunity to serve with the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
The foundation for that school was laid by respected Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people across the country are engaged in this service on 15th.
Organisations also contributed enthusiastically in this regard.
School children, college students, National Cadet Corps, Nation Cadet Corps, Youth Organisations, Media Corps, Corporate Organisations etc.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Swachhta loved countrymen for their contribution.
Come on, let's get a phone call.
But if you didn't telephone on how this was a lucky thing for you after the toilets, you might have missed the attention of the people associated with this movement.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world.
This time, India is organising the worlds largest Swachhta Convention, which is historically unprecedented.
At Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC), Health Ministers and experts from across the globe share their experiences and experiments related to cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October this year to mark the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Annal.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's constitution provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993, inspired by this vision.
The Commission is set up to complete 25 years in a few days.
The Commission has not only protected human rights but has also done the work of enhancing the dignity of man.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, who is close to our hearts, said that human rights are not alien to us.
Our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) symbolises the principle of 'Sarve Bhawantu Sukinah' from the Vedic era.
The Commission has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence for the countrymen.
It provides a healthy society with confidence in the best democratic values.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also functioning.
As a society, we need to understand and practice the importance of human rights and this is the basis of progress for all, for all.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, the birth centenary celebrations of Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji are going to begin.
Let us remember that all these dignitaries have been inspiring us.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji will come, and I will speak in detail about it in the next Mann Ki Baat, but today I would like to mention why for a few years, on the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, on 31st October, a Unity Campaign is being organised in every small town, area and village of India.
This year, we have to make efforts to organize this drive for unity in our villages, regions, cities and metropolitan cities.
The movement for unity is the best way to think about Sardar ji because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
I urge all of you that on 31st October, we should strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society, every unit of the country through the mission of unity and this will be a special tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
My best wishes to all my countrymen on this auspicious day.
Rakshabandhan showcases love and trust among brothers and sisters.
This festival is also a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Even Raksha Kairu, the Kapuk Kairu, has a special story in the history of the country connected with the thread of faith to two different regions or religious people.
A few days later, Jenmashtami will be coming.
Elephants, horses and turtles - Jai Kanhaiyalal Ki and Govinda-Kovinda all over the ecosystem are sounding to the threshold.
In Sri Krishna's devotion, the joy of blissful joy is indescribable.
Our youth will be making preparations for Dahi-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
My heartiest congratulations to Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami for all the countrymen.
Thank you, sister inmai, for bringing forth a special thing.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, we are celebrating Sanskrit Diwas on the eve of Chiravana Parunami.
I extend my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bringing this great treasure to the people of Merukoti and the common man.
I have a great significance in every language.
India is proud that Tamil language is the world's oldest language
Similarly, it is a matter of pride for all Indians that from the Vedic period to this day, Sanskrit language has played a major role in spreading wisdom.
The enlightenment of every sphere of life is enshrined in all languages and its literature.
Whether it is science, technology, agriculture, health, astronomy, architecture, architecture, mathematics, management, economy or environment.
I am glad to know that the villagers of Battur district of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit as a litigation.
There are possibilities of creating 200 insertions, i.e. prefix, 22 differentials, i.e., suffix and the indiscriminate words of society.
Therefore, any precise feeling or thing can be precisely described.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji, we always remember him.
It is his birthday that we celebrate Teachers Day throughout the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I convey my best wishes for science, education and the dedication of teachers to the students.
My dear countrymen, this season has brought the aspirations of our hardworking farmers.
In some places, it is natural that there is more rainfall than others.
We all saw how bad the lives of the people were affected by the terrible floods of Kerala.
Though we cannot fully compensate for their grief, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this sad hour.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover at the earliest.
Everyone has taken a resolution on how to mitigate the sufferings of the people of Kerala and how to share their grief.
We are well aware that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue operation in Kerala.
They did not leave any attempt to save the people trapped in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Army, Border Security Force, Central Industries, Security Forces and Expression Force have all contributed immensely to the movement.
In particular, during this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the NDRF survivors.
The festival of Onam was celebrated yesterday, let us invite the nation, particularly Kerala, to give strength to this onam festival, to rise rapidly from the impact of this disaster and to see the rapid development journey of Kerala.
Once again I assure the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters from all over the country that the entire country is supporting and helping you in this difficult time.
My dear countrymen,
This time I was watching the suggestions made for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see what the people of the country have written a lot about - our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Keerthi of Gaziaabad, Swati Vatsa from Sonib, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
MyGov has also been requested by Narendra Modi on Narendra Modi's Narendra Modi Mobile App to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life, like Swabna Bannerji and Akhilesh Pandey from Kadihar in Bihar.
On the 16th of August, the nation and the world were filled with sadness by the news of Atal ji's time.
He quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he has been out of active politics for the past decade.
He did not appear in the news and lived away from public life.
Though New Year is a big gap, the nation and the world have seen that after 16th August, this ten year gap has not grown in the minds of common Indians.
Atal ji's love, suffering and sorrow enriched the nation, showing his enormous uniqueness.
Over the last few days, the greatest dimensions of Atal ji have emerged before the nation.
People recall him as an outstanding Parliamentarian, a sensible writer, an outstanding speaker, a Prime Minister with a plunder of minds.
The nation would have always been grateful to Atal Ji for bringing good governance in the mainstream.
But today I would like to mention another dimension of Atal jis wide-ranging personality, which will be of immense benefit to India in the coming days due to the political culture that Atal ji has given to India, its efforts to transform it and its institutionalisation.
It's sure.
India would have been grateful for the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This transformation led to two significant changes in Indian politics.
First, the number of Ministers of States should be only 15 of the total number of Assembly Constituencies.
Secondly, under the anti-party legislation, he increased the size of one-third of the previous membership to two-thirds.
At the same time, there were clear protocols for ensuring the losing of members of the party attackers.
Over the years, there was a political culture of forming large-scale ministries in India, and these great cabinets were established to retain political leaders and not to share their work.
Atal ji changed this situation.
His activity saved money and expenditure.
More efficiency has also improved.
This was possible only by a prophet like Atal ji and a healthy tradition began to live in our political culture.
Atal ji is a true patriot.
During his tenure, the budget was modified at the time of his presentation.
Earlier, the budget was presented at 5 pm as per the British rule.
In 2001, Atal ji shifted the time of presentation of the Budget from 5 PM to 11 PM.
Similarly, today you people are seeing the discussions going on between the central government and the state governments on holding elections simultaneously.
On this occasion, we assure ourselves that we will realize his dream of a Comprehensive and Developing India, I also dedicate to Atal ji on behalf of us.
When there is talk of parliament, it is spoken about frozen, shouting and postponement, but if something good happens, it does not speak much about it.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
All MPs have tried to make the Monsoon Session more productive, beyond party differences, resulting in passage of 21 Bills in Lok Sabha and 14 Bills in Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
During the session, a number of important bills were passed for the benefit of the youth and the backward classes.
This process will help in achieving the goal of social justice.
The amendment to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed.
The Act further protects the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
And there shall be hope in the hearts of the humble, which shall prevent the atrocities of the guilty.
No civilized society can tolerate the injustice committed against women.
The country is not ready to to tolerate the perpetrators of sexual abuse
The Congress has, therefore, passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill to impose severe punishment.
You might have read a few days earlier that a court in Mandsor, Madhya Pradesh, had sentenced two offenders to death in two months, who had tried the case and sentenced the girl to sexual assault.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, completed the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have expedited judgments in such cases.
The legislation will help in curbing crimes committed against women and girls.
When we move ahead for the welfare of the nation, we can transform the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time, in the Monsoon Session, everyone collectively set a special model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions and millions of people has been on the ongoing Asian Games in arda.
It is only to see which Indian soldier has won the medal in every day's footsteps in newspapers, television, in news and on social media.
Asian Games are now underway.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
I also extend my best wishes to the sportspersons who will be participating in the upcoming event.
Indias sportspersons have achieved excellently in the field of shooting and wrestling, but our sportspersons have also won medals in the past in the fields of Wushu and Boating.
These are not mere medals - the testimony of the hopes and dreams of Indian sportspersons...
This is a very positive sign that our women are among the increasing number of medal winners for the country.
In such a scenario, among the young athletes who have won medals, our youth below the age of 15-16 will be among them.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
We all have seen the construction of houses and buildings with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that a large mountain, a single single rocky hill, has been carved into a very special, extensive and magnificent temple. This is beyond imagination, but this temple is also the Kailash Temple in Ellora, Maharashtra.
India has been a land engineering experiment.
Several engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved unimaginable things and presented examples of wonders in the engineering world.
Lakhs of farmers and ordinary people are now benefitting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam that he had constructed across the Cauvery river.
He is bowed down to these parts of the country and the nation pays his respect to him.
In his memory, we observe the 15th of September as Engineers Day.
The engineers of our country have put a mark in the entire world on the path shown by him.
While we talk about the miracles of the engineering world, we recall an incident that occurred in 2001 when a terrible earthquake struck Kutch in Gujarat.
When I was working there as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village where I had to meet a ancestor who had crossed 100 years of age.
They used to make fun of me, they used to call my house a park in Bar-Kutch.
He further said that my house has seen three earthquakes.
I myself have faced three earthquakes.
I know them in the same house.
But there is no impact anywhere.
Several centuries ago, the engineers of that period had inspired me to see how these buildings were constructed in accordance with the local environment and how the people were able to live safely.
Today, as we commemorate Engineers Day, we have to think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural calamities.
We will meet in Mann Ki Baat, we will speak openly, we will carry the country forward through our hearts, we will be united.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July, 2018
My dear countrymen, salute.
The vastness and diversity of India, though on the one hand, sometimes rain shows its distinction.
But why should we criticize the rain
As a result, nature sometimes expresses its anger.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to preserve nature, to preserve nature and to preserve nature so that there is a disruption in the gifts of nature.
A few days ago, a natural calamity drew the attention of the entire world and stirred human society.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave.
But the game of law was different that day.
After they had gone far inside the cave, suddenly the water of the cave was substantially stagnant due to cockroaches.
Their way out was blocked.
They stayed on a small rock inside the cave for 18 days, not one day, not two days, because there was no way out.
When death takes place in front of your eyes, you can imagine how the situation would have to be spent every moment.
On the one hand, they were impatient and on the other, the entire human society was united and expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were praying for the safety of these children.
It is not that the parents will not suffer or tears will not grow in the eyes of the mother.
Crossing so many difficult situations, the world was surprised to see that the boys did not let down their faith while expressing so much adventure and adventure in a water-rich cave.
This thing tells us that when a human society stands united, miracles take place.
But we need to work tirelessly to target ourselves from being calm and steadfast.
Just a few days ago, the favorite poet of our country, Neeraj ji, left us behind.
He has a special significance - belief, self-confidence and dedication.
The months of July-August are the most important months for farmers and all the youth.
Because these months they are the peak season of colleges.
Millions of youth like Sathyam come out of school and join colleges.
If the months of February-March are for examinations, papers and answers, the months of April-May are joyous on vacations and decide the results, the direction to travel in life and the work to do.
It is only in July that the focus of the youth has shifted from questions to cut-off marks, an extremely important period.
Students' attention goes away from home and students go to the hotel.
Students leave the umbrella of their parents and join the umbrella of professors.
I am fully confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting college life.
This is the first time that you leave your house and leave the village and leave a safe environment and start driving yourself.
For the first time, so many youngsters have come out of their homes and set a new direction for their lives.
Many students would have joined their colleges and some would have joined them.
Whatever I want to say to you, be calm, enjoy your inner self-consciousness in life, there is no doubt that it is important to read books, while at the same time keep yourself in search of new things.
There is a special respect for old friends.
Young comrades are very valuable, while selecting new friends, eating and pursuing friendship is one of the greatest intellectuals.
You can learn some new things, some new skills and new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started the new contest.
Talking about the college season, it was reported that Asharam Chowdry, a student from a poorest family in Madhya Pradesh, had overcome the difficult challenges of life.
He was awarded the first ever medical examination in the Jothpur AIIMS.
His father is working as a sanitation worker and is managing his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
Students from so many such poor families have achieved their relentless endeavour to overcome the worst situations.
Their achievements inspire us, the father of Kushi from Nagpur is a driver at the school bust, the father of Karthik from Haryana is a guardian, the father of Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand is working at Brindal Sulai, and student Ramesh is also selling sports goods at the festival.
Likewise, Anushka Panda, a Divyang woman from Kutka, has been suffering from a spinal muscular atrophy since birth...
All of them, with a sense of dedication, with a sense of faith, with a breaking of obstacles, made the world look back.
If we look around ourselves, we can see many such examples.
And some good thing that happens in some corner of the land fills my heart with strength, and gives inspiration.
When I talk about such youngsters, I am bringing to your notice the thing about Neeraj ji, this is the meaning of life.
I would like to hear the songs of the earth. I would like to invite all of you to the light. I would like to eradicate the cruelty of Vali with flowers, I would like to sing the mountains with my songs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes went on a message saying, Two youths have realised Modi's dream.
And when we read it more in detail then we came to know how today our youth is making efforts to transform the lives of the common man by using technology intelligently and constructively.
Once in the city of San Jose, which is known as the centre of technology, I was talking to Indian youth.
I had requested them to take time to think about how they can use their capabilities for India.
I appealed to the people of the country to make use of knowledge and talent for the motherland by exiting abroad.
Two IT experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji took up this challenge and made a new effort.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji jointly created the Smart Gaon App and Intellectual Villages App.
This App connects the villagers to the world and enables them to access any information and information on their mobile phones.
Rae Barelis Tawatpur residents, Panchayat Chairpersons, District Judges and District Collectors all created awareness about the use of this App.
And if you look at this event very minutely then we must keep in mind that these youngsters live in the United States and live in the midst of their ideas and lifestyles and ideas that despite being out of India several years ago they have negligible knowledge of their village, have understood the challenges and have been emotionally associated with their village.
This is the reason why we have been able to understand the requirements of the village and work accordingly.
It is natural for every Indian to have a grip on their villages and their roots and to achieve something for their motherland.
But sometimes, due to the compulsions, distances and conditions of time, this feeling becomes slightly blurred, and if a little filthy, this sentiment immediately catches up and drags them towards past days.
Bundarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the audience, the devotees of Varkari are walking with their teeth on a pilgrimage to Bandarapur.
The pilgrimage is called Vari and lakhs of devotees participate in it.
They are singing and singing and dancing and composing music and lyrics on the teeth with the hands of great saints like Swami and Dukaram Swami.
Tirthankars reach there to visit Lord Vittopa or Pandurangan.
Lord Vital protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the deprived.
The devotees of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with pain and devotion.
Walking to the Vitoba temple in Bunderpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all the wonderful experiences.
My appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat is that if you get the opportunity then once you have the opportunity to enjoy the bundle of turmeric.
Several great saints like Gyaneshwar Swami, Namadeva, Eknath, Ramadas Swami, Dukaram Swamis have been guiding the common people of Maharashtra even today.
They have been giving strength to fight against superstitions and the heritage of these great souls has been inspiring every corner of India.
We get a great message of the importance of harmony, love and brotherhood, be it the parrot song.
Just as the great legacy of the great saints who presented themselves at the feet of the Lord was in our land, so were the great men who had dedicated themselves to the motherland of India, and presented their lives to her.
This great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has put an endless mark in the minds of many Indians.
On 23rd July, we observe the birth anniversary of Tilak ji and commemorate his birth anniversary on 1st August.
Lokamanya is full of adventure and confidence.
He had the power and intellect to directly point to the mistakes of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was fascinated by Lokmanya Tilak.
On the 1st of August 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak passed away, he had vowed to build a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected as the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality, he immediately selected Victoria Garden, named after the ueen of Britain, to set up the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Inside, the British were enraged by the action, so the ruler refused to permit it.
It is interesting to note that after Sardar Patel assumed office, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got a good person but has also got a lot of heart because of which the statue of Tilak has been constructed.
My dear countrymen, the special feature of this Thiruvananthapuram Statue is that this Thiruvananthapuram Statue is very rare, in which he is sitting in his chair, in which he is engraved.
I am talking to you about the period of our year by the British.
It is because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak that there is a tradition of celebrating social Ganesh Utsav.
Our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history are still deeply inspired by our younger society.
Today, in almost all the streets of many cities we can see the bowls of worshipping the heroes.
I would like to introduce a widespread campaign on environmental friendly festivities in every city, on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp and on environment friendly festivities.
I will definitely take your views to the people.
Every Indian should reach goodwill and goodwill for development.
This will build a New India.
On the same day that is 23rd July, another son of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the cause of the people of India to breathe free air.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad Ji.
The youth of India who will be inspired by these words - Revolution thirsty in our hearts, and the power of the enemies alone, these poems became sympathetic to many youngsters like Ashfaqullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
The courage of Chandrashekhar Azad, his freedom struggle and his passion inspired many youngsters.
Azad ji risked his life, but did not bow to foreign rule.
I was overwhelmed by Chandrashekhar Azad's visit to the village Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I express my heartfelt condolences to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Just a few days ago, Hima Das, India's heroine and farmer daughter, won a gold medal in the 400m event at the World Athletics Championships in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman from the country, has written to my letter by email from Indonesia, and is now preparing for Asian Games.
It gives me immense pride that if an athlete is the most important moment in his life, it is the capture of the Tricolour on the world stage and I have done it.
Ekta, we are all proud of you.
You have made the nation proud.
Grand Prix, the world athlete for Persons with Disabilities (Tunisia) won the Ektan Gold and Bronze medal in 2018.
His achievement is that he has converted the challenge of disability into a means of success.
In 2003, due to road accidents, Ekta Bayan lost her lower limbs, although she did not lose her chest, strengthened herself further and achieved her numerous targets.
Yogesh Kaduniya, a disabled person, won a Gold in Grand Fire, Grand Fire and won a Gold Medal in the Screenplay along with Sundar Singh Gurjar who won the Gold Medal in the Screenplay.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to Ekta Bhayan ji, Yogish Ghaduniya ji and Sundar Singh ji for their self-confidence and unparalleled thirst.
You should go further, play more, enjoy and open.
My dear countrymen, in August several events of history are full of festivals and festivals, but sometimes due to the weather diseases also enter their homes.
My best wishes to you all for your excellent health and for the patriotic motivation and for the many centuries-long celebrations.
Once again, we will definitely meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June, 2018
A few days ago, a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore.
All of you must have realized that I am mentioning about the competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first international test tournament from Afghanistan and the historic test competition from Afghanistan has happened with India.
Afghan President Ashraf Kani also tagged me and said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan."
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for setting up a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talent.
Rashid represents the special features of Afghanistan.
This acting will be unforgettable for all.
On the one hand, I consider it a special one for other reasons, even though it is a memorable one because of the first one.
The Indian team has demonstrated something that is exemplary throughout the world.
We can understand the nature of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is a wonderful way to connect the world and to showcase the skills and skills of our youth.
My best wishes to both the Indian and Afghanistan teams.
I am confident that in the future, we will play with each other in the same way as in the spirit of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, when we celebrated the fourth International Day of Yoga, the entire world joined it.
I am told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga has been organised by women in a big way.
In the highest peaks of Ladakh, India and China's soldiers joined hands in Yoga.
Some of the soldiers also studied Yoga in submarines
Similarly, some soldiers studied Yoga at the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen.
Our air warriors performed Yogasan at a height of 15,000 feet in the middle of the earth and drew everyone in awe.
The point to be noted is that they did not do this as they sat on the plane, but did it in the air.
Yoga sessions were held everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
Around 750 Divyang brothers and sisters from different walks of life took part in Yoga and became world renowned.
Yoga has done the job of uniting the people of the world without any restrictions on caste, religion and geography and we have been living with the feeling of harmony between Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and the world for centuries.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We are reminded of physicians when there are difficulties.
But on this day when we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of the doctors, I thank them.
The doctors of our country have sealed the world because of their capabilities.
While the medical profession is skilled and hardworking, our doctors are well-known in solving complex medical problems.
India is a nation with a rich history of a day without a historical event or a month.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I will be visiting Maghar on 28th.
You all know why Kabir Das Ji had gone to Maghar.
Saint Kabir Das emphasised on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poetical forms of Shakis and Dohas.
This was his objective.
This objective is to be seen in his works and it is equally encouraging in today's world.
Listen to his Doha - Kabir Soi Peer Hai, Joe Jane Peer, Joe Peer Peer Na Janahee, So Ka Peer Man Peer.
Kabir Dass emphasised on social harmony.
In Doha, what he says...
There is sin where there is grief and mischief.
He added, Jadi Na Poochso Satu Ki, Pooch Legiye Gnan.
Neither ask you of the saints what their caste is, but seek wisdom from them.
His appeal to the people is to embrace and respect the people through their wisdom, beyond casteism.
His comments have been impacting centuries after and even today.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji said that the service done to the poor and needy is a favour to God.
Wherever he goes, there are a lot of social benefits he has done.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had introduced a cooking system called Langar.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The long, widespread India's war of independence is very profound and full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the state of Punjab.
The year 2019 is about 100 years of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a shameful demand for humanity.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi, on the Narendra Modi App, Dr.
First of all, I express my gratitude to you all.
I am glad to see your passion for India's success.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
It is well known that at the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji addressed the convocation of Kolkata University in Bengali.
This is for the first time that Englishmen addressed the Convocation of the University of Kolkata during the reign of the British.
From 1947 to 1950 Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and, in fact, he laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development and laid a strong foundation for it was not surprising.
The first Industrial Policy of Freedom India, which was released in 1948, unfolded with his ideas and vision.
Doctor.
Mukherjees dream is to make India self-reliant and self-reliant in every sector.
While India is developing large industries, he wanted full attention to the medium and small scale industries, industries, textiles and slum industries.
During the period 1948 to 1950, he constructed all the Handloom Boards, Gadars and Rural Industries Boards to provide financial and institutional support for the holistic development of MSMEs.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees contribution.
He was keen on the development of West Bengal.
Her understanding, intellectual and creative activity has saved a large part of Bengal and is part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video conference.
There was an opportunity to go beyond the files and learn directly from them about the changes in life.
While knowing about an ordinary man... his simple words, his language of experience, the incident of him, gave a yearly look to his mind.
Women from remote villages have been providing services ranging from pension to passports to senior citizens in villages through the Common Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister collects and sells ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash from Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are conducting medicines and also going to villages around the country and getting affordable medicines.
School children from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste management in the tinkering lab at school at their young age.
Throughout this programme, more than the success of the government, more than the success of the ordinary people, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of New India and the strength of the soul of New India.
On the contrary, there are some people in the society - unless they talk about delusion, unless they are sorry about inability, unless they don't instigate distrust, unless they seek a path of unity and diversity.
In such a scenario, while talking about the events in their lives with the common man, with new hopes and enthusiasm, I dont think that this is the fame and success of the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village turns into an inspiration for 1. 25 billion countrymen.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people joined this video bridge programme and you have worked to provide me with a new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I have always seen that if we look around, there is something good in our eyes somewhere or somewhere.
There are people who understand good.
We can also smell the aroma of good things.
Over the past days, one thing attracted my attention, which is a very strange combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers and on the other there are farming brothers and sisters who work in the fields.
Farmers included themselves, planned and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
Experts and engineers trained farmers through this Trust on how to learn new techniques of farming and how to do organic farming and crops with one thousand in the fields.
Today they are not only cultivating vegetables but also selling their vegetables through this trust and selling them at affordable prices.
In another way, I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, engineers and technicians have left their clutches and have joined the farmers and connected themselves with the villages and have taken the path of working together with fields and crops.
Friends
Your youth is truly an inspiration for any young man.
Other youngsters of the country will also be able to visit their portal and look after their work closely and they will also be encouraged to work in different areas of the society in their respective areas.
One dream for all the countrymen, one nation is one tax.
If anybody wants to appreciate the implementation of the One Tax Reform, I would like to commend the states in the same way.
Till date, 27 GST meetings have been held, various political ideologies have been held, participants from various states, states with different priorities have participated.
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being levied.
The success of the GST currency and the celebration of currency actions.
The checkpoints have come to an end, the movement of goods is going on at a rapid pace, and the time is being saved and substantial profits are being made in the goods sector.
It may be the world's largest tax reform.
It was generally considered that it would take 5 to 7 years for such a massive reform, such a massive nation, such a massive population.
In this context, the biggest success has been achieved by 125 crore Indians.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat May, 2018
Hello.
Once again I got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I am sure all of you will remember that a group of six women commanders of the Indian Navy have sailed for months.
They travelled over 22,000 nautical maritimes in different oceans and many seas.
This is the first time that such a journey has taken place in the world.
On Wednesday, the lady had the opportunity to meet the gems and hear about their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their excellent work in enhancing the pride of the navy and the glory of the country, especially the women of India, who have proved that they are no children in the world.
Who will not know the spirit of adventure
For centuries, Everest has been a challenge for humanity and the heroic people have faced this challenge.
On May 16, a group of five tribal students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, including Manisha Durve, Premesh Ale, Ugandan Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam, climbed the highest peak in the world.
The students of the Ashram School started their training in August 2017 and were trained at Warda, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youths were selected as part of the SHAURYA Abhiyan training programme.
In accordance with the name, they made the nation proud at the Everest Peak.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur School and to my young friends.
Shivangi Padak, a 16 year old Indian girl from Nepal, is the youngest Indian woman to reach the Everest peak.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya will join the first father and daughter of India touched by Everest.
It is not that some youngsters are climbing the Everest peak.
On May 19, Sangeeta Behal, who was more than 50 years old, climbed the Everest peak.
Some climbers on the Everest Peak show that they have talent and emotion.
In the past few days, a group of Border Guards had climbed the Everest peak under the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan and Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, but when they came down, they brought together a massive dump.
It is a matter of appreciation, while it highlights their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
For years, people have climbed the Everest peak, many of whom have won.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave-hearts, especially women.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, when I talked about Fit India two months ago, I didn't even think that such responses would come to me.
I didn't even think that people from all walks of life would support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the kind of sports we are engaged in, the kind of sports that the country will be involved in.
In the social media, people are sharing videos of fitness challenges, decking each other and challenging each other.
Today everyone is coming together with this mission of Fit India.
Whether it is film industry, sports, or the common man of the country, be it soldiers or school teachers, India will be determined everywhere.
I believe that this challenge will help us to keep ourselves healthy and motivate others to make ourselves healthy.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports played on the streets were a part of every child's life, which continues to be close today.
In particular, these games have been an important part of the summer vacations.
Children will be playing for hours without worry or anxiety after lunch and after lunch.
In some of these games, the entire family was a participant.
The games ranged from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Kutch to Samaria.
Yes, they may have been known by different names at different places.
For example, it is known as 7stones, which is known as Lahore, Pittu, Sadolia, Dikori, Sadodiya.
We can find solidarity and unity in the backdrop of our country's diversity.
One sport is known by different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat where I know about a game called Somal-Isdo.
It is played on a square platform of 8  8 square feet with turmeric or turmeric.
It has been played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, they called it 'Saukabara' and 'Attu' in Madhya Pradesh, which was called by many names - 'Bakhetali' in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, 'Tamil Nadu' and 'Sangabo' in Rajasthan.
Even though I don't know how to speak in every state language, I came to know only after playing it.
Are there any of us who don't dancing kittyp hoofs and killi dandu
It is known by various names in various parts of the country .
In Andhra it is called Kotibilla or Karrabilla, in Odisha it is called Kulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitthalu.
When everyone gets airborne, when everyone is playing, we can express the unique qualities that we have without reservation.
You can see many kids shouting but when they are playing they become very active.
They express themselves themselves, they look deeper, and the childhood that is hidden inside them is revealed.
Determining the goals, how to achieve the mindset, how to create team spirit and how to help each other.
I can see that in the training programmes related to business management, we are now using our traditional sports to improve overall personality and mutual skills.
From children to adults, when everyone is playing together, generation gap is called, it disappears magically.
We can also understand our culture and traditions.
Many sports create awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be produced, played in the streets and shoes, and these games that seem strange to our new generation will be developed.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, India will officially organise World Environment Day celebrations.
This time the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution (BEAT PLASTIC PLUTION).
I would like to appeal to all of you that by understanding this significance, we should decide to avoid using polythene and low quality plastics, we should strive to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, wildlife and our health.
Enter the World Environment Day wed-india 2018, where a lot of suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner. See, know, try to adapt them to your daily lives.
When there is heavy heat, when there is a flood, when there is no rain, when there is unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, talk about global warming, climate change etc.
In the last few weeks, we have seen dust storms, strong winds and heavy rains in many parts of the country. This is not a natural season.
This has also resulted in the loss of lives.
All this is the outcome of a major change in climate change
Our culture and our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live in harmony with nature and be in harmony with nature.
Gandhiji had put forward this thing in every step of his life.
We will make arrangements for the maintenance of the tree not only with tree plantation but also till it grows and grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
The message that Yoga has provided for unity is Yoga and a harmonious society, the world has experienced it again and again over the last few years.
Yoga is born with psychology, it always preserves us like a father.
Things are born, this is like the mother of children, mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
By continuously practicing Yoga, verbalism becomes our children, our sisters, our brothers and sisters, the land is our bed and wisdom keeps our hunger away.
If all these qualities are comrades of each other, then that Yogin triumphs over all kinds of fears.
I once again invite all the countrymen to take forward the tradition of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the commemoration of the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
I salute Panditji.
He was a brave association with someone else this May.
In 1857, in the same month of May, our countrymen showed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers united against injustice and showed their courage.
The tragic thing is that for a long time, the 1857 riots or the soldiers were saying that they were mutiny.
In fact, it is an attempt not only to underestimate that event but also to insult our self-respect and self-respect.
Veer Savarkar wrote without fear that 1857 was not a mere riot, it was the first war of independence.
Several freedom fighters along with Savarkar celebrated the 50th anniversary of this event in India House in London.
He is an expert in handling both weapons and weapons.
We know Veer Savarkar, generally for his heroism and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has been a stupendous poet, social reformer and has always strengthened the cause of harmony and unity.
I remember the respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji saying about Savarkar ji.
Besides being a poet of understanding, he was also a brave revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of our daughters and daughters with hope and aspirations.
If there is a desire to achieve something then if you decide to achieve something then you can achieve success by crossing all obstacles.
The story is about someone who dedicates himself to fulfilling the dreams of others, who lives in the hut of Cuttack, Odisha.
Prakash Rao is theirs.
You will be surprised to know that today an ordinary tea seller is burning the education fire in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides all the facilities like education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I congratulate Shri Prakash Rao Ji for his untiring hard work, his vision and for giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has removed the darkness in their lives.
Who knows not the scripture of the scripture of Damascus Maa Jyotiramaya
But one who showed it was D.
His life is a concept for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
There may be instances of inspiration around you.
They will wait for Piraichandran's visit in a few days.
I am confident that all of you will celebrate Eid with great enthusiasm and on this occasion the children will get an excellent accomplishment of a nice day.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated in the event.
You can imagine the situation in which thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating.
If there is an atmosphere of enthusiasm, hope, inspiration, aspirations, aspirations, aspirations and a spirit of accomplishment then can anyone be impressed by it
India has made an unprecedented achievement.
Winning the medals is a matter of pride for the soldiers and a moment of pride for all the countrymen.
Enthusiastic and enthusiastic.
We all mix together with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I would like to share with you what these players have told me.
For the first time, many things have been done.
Wrestlers who have participated in Indias Commonwealth Games this time have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has won medals in all the sports she has participated.
She was the first Indian woman to win the Gold in the Table Tennis Single Winner.
India won the highest gold shooting competition.
Sachin Chaudhary won the medal in the Commonwealth Games, India's only Para Power Lifter.
Moreover, if these competitions were special, most of the winners were women.
Whether Squashak, Boxing, Weightlifting, Shooting, Women Veers displayed their talents by playing very well.
The Final Competition of Bhubaneswar was attended by two Indian heroes Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
Sindhu was interacted.
I had asked them to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am glad that people have joined it with a lot of enthusiasm.
Several people have written letters to express their support for this, sharing important information and information about their physical activity in the social media.
Sasikanth Bhonsle shared the film he took in a swimming pool and wrote that my body is my weapon, water is my own, swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written I feel happy and healthy after walking in the morning
As for me, smile was mixed with smile and when we were happy, he wrote that smile should be smiled.
After seeing all this, it is good that many well-known people are also inspiring our youth in the most interesting ways for Fit India.
Film star Akshay Kumar has given a video on Twitter.
His other video has become more popular, in which he can see people playing handcuffs.
Many youngsters have been sharing their experiences by connecting themselves with Fit India initiatives.
Its not just your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the age groups, men and women should make efforts to associate themselves with Yoga.
You must have been thinking about how to enjoy holidays and where to go.
Today I invite you to do a new job
I can see many youngsters nowadays spending their time learning something new.
The significance of summer training is on the rise and the youth are engaged in this search and training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, we get a new dimension of life beyond writing and computer.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water, are jointly organising the Swachh Bharat Summer Exercise 2018.
You should visit MyGov portal and register for your participation in Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I believe that our youth will further take this movement for cleanliness.
Definitely send your information, send photographs, and give video gifts.
Come on, come on
Let us have the opportunity to learn during these vacations to get a new experience.
Just a few days ago, young people from Delhi were showing something about Good News in India and they are serving the poor children for teaching.
These youngsters have stepped up a massive campaign to educate the street children and children living in slums in Delhi.
This innovative work was undertaken by children who were betting on the streets or sucking the conditions of those engaged in retail jobs.
This campaign, which started with 15 children in the slums near the Gita Colony of Delhi, is today connecting 2000 children in 12 locations in the capital.
Youth, teachers and professionals who have been associated with this movement have been trying to transform the society by sparing two hours in their daily schedule.
Brothers and sisters, Likewise, some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
Because of their concerted efforts, they have not only enriched their position but have also enriched the future of their region.
Farming of millets, pesticides, maize and parli are done in Bhageshwar in Uttarakhand.
As a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for it.
They set up a cooperative organisation in Munnar village, where they set up a biscuit manufacturing factory.
Considering the mindset of farmers, management has linked it to the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being transported not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres in Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, every year the income of this organization has not only reached 10-15 lakh rupees but it has also created employment for more than 900 families and it has also stopped people coming out of the district.
Everyone talks about it but is it not our obligation
Do we not think that water conservation is a responsibility of the society
It must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our forefathers have done this for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have discovered new methods to understand how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, you might have noticed that some temples there were big inscriptions related to dipping, water conservation and dry-time arrangements.
Large inscriptions are found everywhere in Mannar Temple, Cheranma Devi, Mandirpatti and Kathgodam.
Don't forget that even today, various stadium wells are known as tourist destinations and these are the living examples of our ancestors about the water conservation mission.
Adalaj in Gujarat and Rani Kee Wave in Patan have been declared as the world heritage site of UN education, science and culture.
In the months of April, May, June and July, they get an excellent opportunity to conserve rain water. The more we are already ready, the more benefits we get.
The budget of MGNREGA is being spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, everyone has been making their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
An average of 32,000 crore rupees has been spent on water conservation and water management beyond the MGNREGA every year.
About 2017-18, out of the total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore, about 55 per cent, i. e.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through these water conservation and water management works.
7000 people working under this project have worked hard in seventeen days to revive the Kuttapore river in Kerala.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-ridden rivers, but in some areas of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers Sasur and Kaderi have dried up in Fatehpur district.
District Administration faced the challenge of massive land and water conservation activities under MGNREGS.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, these dried Sarsur and Kaderi rivers were revived.
Whether it is animal husbandry, birds, farmers, farming or villages, you have seen such a great success of blessings
The months of May, June and July will be coming, we will also take some responsibilities for water conservation and water management.
My dear countrymen, before Mann Ki Baat, there are reports from all four sides, letters, telephone calls etc.
Ayan Kumar Banerji from Devidola village of North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal has written in MyGov: We are celebrating Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about Rabindranath Tagore's philosophy of 'peaceful, beautiful and honest'.
Please talk about this thing in Mann Ki Baat programme and there will be an opportunity for people to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was an integral part of wisdom and wisdom and his writings have left an indelible mark in the hearts of all readers.
Rabindranath, an intellectual, a diverse person, but we can enjoy that within him every moment a teacher lived.
He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students, he wrote in his Geetanjali.
I am not a person of Bengali language, but I was used to awakening early in my childhood and the broadcast of radio in eastern India will start very fast and it will start late in western India.
When there is an opportunity to hear these poems Anandaloge, Ahuner and Boroshmoni, there will be a lot of inspiration in the mind.
You too, Rabindra Sangeet must have written his poems.
My dear countrymen, in a few days the holy month of Ramzan will start.
All over the world, the month of Ramlan is being celebrated with a lot of hardship and respect.
Nothing's social page is that when a man is hungry, he feels the hunger of others, and when he is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an occasion to recall the message and teachings of the sovereign Mohammed Nabis.
The lesson we learn from his life is to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked a sovereign ambassador what activity in Islam was very important.
The messenger said that providing food to the poor and needy is harmonious in everyone, whether we know them or not.
Sovereign Mohammad Nabis believed in wisdom and compassion.
Sovereign ambassador Mohammad Nabi has said that if you have something more than you need, give it to the man you need, that is why the gift has been given more importance in the month of Ramzan.
People donate money to the poor during this holy month.
The sovereign Mohammed Nabis claim that no man is rich because of his clean soul, but because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb empowered crores of people on the edge of the Constitution, be it the victims, the deceitful, the oppressed, or the underprivileged.
There can be no better example of compassion than this.
The compassion of the people is one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, Buddhist traditions are mixed with their roots.
This is the reason why we are enriching the infrastructure of Buddhist tourism and connecting the important sites of Southeast Asian countries with the special Buddhist religious places of India.
Today there are conflicts and the misery of the people everywhere in the world and the path to eradicate the hatred of Lord Buddha by compassion.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the Lord Buddha spread across the world for Buddha, for those who are devoted to compassion, for those who believe in compassion and for all others.
I offer my blessings to the entire world from Buddha, through which we can fulfil our responsibility to create a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
You must have heard of the idols of Laughing Buddha which you are laughing and said that this laughing Buddha would have been fortunate, but very few people know that Buddha is associated with an important event in the defence of India.
Yes, you can imagine what is the connection between Buddha and the Indian soldiers who are immersed in fervor.
A new self-confidence has emerged from the Indian diaspora spread all over the world.
That day is also a Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998, India carried out nuclear testing at Pokran, Rajasthan, on its western border.
In a way, India's experiment was successful and in a way, India's strength in the field of science and technology was enhanced.
And it came to pass on that day, in the history of India, that it was written in the golden signets of the power of our armies.
Lord Buddha showed that the power of Andrama is essential for peace.
Similarly, today, if we are strong as a nation, we can be at peace with all of us.
It is the same day that we have demonstrated to the world that India is capable of achieving new goals and summits every day under the mighty leadership of a land full of great scientists of India.
We can see in front of our eyes the journey that Atal ji had started, the new joy and fresh joy of taking it forward.
My dear countrymen, once again we can join Mann Ki Baat and talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March, 2018
Today is Rama Navami Punya Diwas.
My best wishes to the people of our country on this auspicious day.
We could see the power of Ram Ram in the life of a sacred brother in every moment of his life.
On 26th January, when all the leaders of ASEAN countries came here, they brought a Cultural Group with them.
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries have given Ramayana before all of us.
It means that Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in ASEAN countries of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to everyone for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, this time and every time you all have received letters, emails, telephone calls and comments in a big way.
Gomal Docker ji started on MyGov online and I read it.
Besides being from the computer sector, I am also happy to see their attraction towards harmony.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I appeal to all those who are engaged in the work related to Mann Ki Baat and to all those who are engaged in the work related to harmony that you should suggest how to implement Gomal's ideas.
Kanshyam Kumar from Barhar village in Nalanda district of Bihar, I read your comments on the Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed concern over the declining ground water levels, and this is very important.
You have been asking for water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all lovers.
Do you know what Yogish Bhadresha ji has said and this time he has applied to the youth about his health.
He considers our youth to be physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I would like to talk to everyone in detail about health - Fit India.
Youngsters, you all can join hands in implementing a healthy India mission.
The President of France visited Kashi during his visit to the country in the past days, and all the scenes of the Yatra were heart-wrenching and impressive.
I would urge you to look at them, redouble them and also bring them to your friends.
Anaka, Jayesh from Chennai, and many more children and Exam Warriors have sent me the grateful cards they found in the background of my book.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that after seeing your letters, all the fatigue of that day disappeared like the ice that saw the desert.
As far as I can read from so many letters, so many telephone calls, comments, and so many things that I can hear are inspired by my heart.
I have to say for months only about those things.
This time most of the letters have been written by the children and they have written about the examinations.
They are sharing their vacation plans.
They have expressed concern about the water for animals and fertilizers in the summer.
Letters have been received from the farmer brothers and sisters regarding the activities being organised throughout the country for the farmers' festivals and farming.
There have been positive suggestions from some citizens regarding water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture and our traditions have been touching upon.
It means that Mann Ki Baat changes according to the climate and the fact is that our Mann Ki Baat has changed the climate of many people.
Why don't change
In these aspects of yours, in your experiences, in these examples of yours, this kind of perception, so much strength, so much understanding and the thirst for doing something good for the nation is reflected.
These include the capability to transform the entire nation.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how a Rickshaw driver from Karimganj district of Assam, Ahmad Ali, with his intense willingness, had established 9 schools for poor children to study.
Thirteen years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, Kolkata's taxi driver Saitul Laskar's sister had to die.
In order to ensure that no poor person dies due to non-treatment, he insisted on establishing a hospital himself.
Situel sold jewels at his house and collected money.
Several passengers travelling in his taxi paid a heartfelt tribute.
An engineer sister donated her first month's salary.
After 12 years of collecting money in this manner, Saituel Laskar finally made substantial efforts
Today, due to his hard work, a 30-bedded hospital is being constructed at Panari village near Kolkata.
There are so many such incentives that mirror my country introduces and mirrors.
Today, when the name of India is pronounced with utmost respect, it is behind this that the incomparable works of Mother India's Itelan are enshrined.
Today, this belief has developed in the minds of every person across the country, among the youth, among women, among the backward, among the poor and the middle class.
We can move forward and our country can make progress.
There is an atmosphere of self-confidence, a positive atmosphere full of desires and aspirations.
This self-confidence, this positive feeling will fulfil our dream of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the coming months will be extremely important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why a lot of letters have come about agriculture.
This time when I saw the video of the discussions with the farmers on the Kisan channel for the farmers of Doordarshan, I feel that every farmer should associate himself with the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and see that the extravagance there should be applied to his fields.
Whether it is Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everyone has considered agriculture, farmers as an important part of the country's economy and the lives of the people.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to talk frequently about the importance of preserving trees, plants and plants and the importance of an excellent agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has called for greater public awareness to ensure better income, better irrigation facilities for our farmers and to increase the production of food and milk.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technology and innovate.
Recently, I visited the Agricultural Development Festival in Delhi.
Interacting with the farmer brothers and sisters and scientists, I had a pleasant experience of knowing, understanding and innovation related to agriculture.
But the thing that had a great impact on me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This region with less terrain has done a great job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved record production in 2015-16 compared to the last five years.
If the goal is determined, if the inspiration is filled, if the mindset is deep, then they can achieve it and they have achieved it.
Today, technology is also handing over the labour of the farmers, due to which the farmers are getting substantial strength.
Brothers and sisters, in this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a reasonable price for their crops.
Besides, the work on agricultural marketing reform in the country is also underway to ensure that the farmers get the right price for their produce.
Efforts are being made to connect regional markets in the village with the wholesale market to the world market.
APMC and e-NAM platform will be integrated while creating and developing necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country so that the farmers do not need to travel long distances to sell their produce.
That is, in a way, such a system is being developed from the farmland to any market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji.
How can the nation celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our commitment. Besides, how can 1. 25 billion Indians shoulder to shoulder showcase their special regards to Gandhi Ji
Can we organize new events
Can we create new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What could be the symbol of 'Gandhi 150'
What can be the slogan
Write to me your comments on these things.
Today, the health sector has crossed the routine approach across the country.
All the work related to health in the country was previously in charge of the Health Ministry, but now all the departments and Ministries, be it Swachh Mantri or AYUSH Ministry, be it Ministry of AYUSH, Consumer Affairs Ministry or WCD Ministry or State Governments, are working towards a healthy India, and there is no greater emphasis on preventive health and affordable health.
Disease preventive healthcare is a very low cost and is also simple.
The more we are aware of preventive health, the better it will be for individuals, for family and for society.
Cleanliness is the first need of life to be healthy.
We all are committed to be a nation, as a result of which healthcare has doubled to nearly 80 in the last four years.
Besides, a wide range of work is being done in the direction of setting up of health centres across the country.
Yoga has established its identity throughout the world with a new energy as preventive healthcare.
Yoga assures both physical and health.
This is the result of our Mann Ki Baat and today Yoga has become a mass movement and it has been included in every household.
There are fewer than 100 days left for the upcoming International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
In the last three International Days of Yoga, people have participated with great enthusiasm in the country and around the world.
This time we will also ensure that we inspire Yoga for Yoga, for Yoga, for the family and for our friends.
This should be further popularised among all age groups, children, youth and senior citizens, by adopting new interesting methods.
Moreover, television and electronics across the country are presenting various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year
But from now on to Yoga Day can we create awareness about Yoga as a mission
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga practitioner.
But some people have turned me into Yoga practitioners through their creation and I have created three-four-dimensional videos like Yoga pilgrimage.
Widespread efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all and the prices of goods are cheaper and easier.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened.
My appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat is that you should bring information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy people.
This will be a great service to them.
Heart stent prices for heart patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
The cost of knee transplantation has also been reduced by 50 to 70 percent.
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, nearly 10 crore families, i. e.
The number of seats in medical colleges in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS will be opened in several states to provide specialized treatment and healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in every 3 districts.
By 2025, the country has set a target to get rid of TB.
Today, Make in India - Make in India is successfully working in the country.
On the same day, Dr. Ambedkar ji had dreamt of India as an industrial power and his vision gives us inspiration today.
Today, India is emerging as a bright hub of the world economy and FDI is the highest in the world.
India has become the focal point of investment, innovation and growth all over the world.
Baba Saheb believed in self-sacrifice.
He does not want any person to spend his time in poverty.
And he didn't think that if he had shared something to the poor, his poverty would be removed.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India entrepreneurs, innovators from our younger society, entrepreneurs and youth have been created.
Today, a historic effort is being made towards the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being built on different coasts of India and the old ports are being strengthened.
Most of the 40 discussions were surrounding the Second World War, the emerging Cold War and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation for Team Indias spirit on the one hand.
He spoke of the significance of the federalism, and reiterated that the Centre and the States should work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have accepted the mantra of Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism - beyond the cooperative federalism in all aspects of governance
And the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is a conception for crores of people like me from the backward classes.
He has shown us that there is no need to be born in a big family or a Seeman family to move forward and that the dreams of the children of poor families in India can be fulfilled and success can be achieved.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I would like to appeal to you that you should participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals in the next few days like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Paisakhi.
It is a day to remember Lord Mahaviras Jayanti, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, who gave us the message of non-violence, will inspire us.
Mahavir Jayanti greetings to all the countrymen.
Esunath's inspirational teachings will always be remembered when it comes to Easter and his messages of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion are always there for mankind.
Paisakhi Festival is being celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
On the same day, Jud Sheetal and Sathuvain in Bihar are celebrated with the pandit of Sadhuvain, Bihu in Assam and Boila Paisa in West Bengal with joy and humility.
Once again my best wishes to you all for all the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat in February, 2018
Today, I am starting with a telephone call for Mann Ki Baat.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science, some have written letters.
Even though the colour of the sea is blue, we all know that due to our daily experience there is no color in the water.
Have we ever wondered why you seem colorful be it a river or a sea
The same question arose in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
This question created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose is given to famous microscopes, which is known as Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence (WAI) was participating in the launch event in Mumbai.
It is interesting to know about the wonders happening in the field of science.
The Artificial Intelligence has been able to develop robots, pa (B) and specific functioning machines.
Today, machines are making their intellectuals even more intense through machines.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to ponder on how Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in making the lives of disabled brothers and sisters easier.
Can we know better about natural calamities through Artificial Intelligence
Can we help farmers with their crops
Can this Artificial Intelligence help in detecting diseases through modern means by making it easier to access healthcare services
A few days ago, I had accompanied the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who had developed a digital device.
If people who are unable to speak through this instrument, it makes them sound, it does the same thing as interacting with each other.
I believe that we can use Artificial Intelligence in such ways.
Science and technology are of neutral value.
There is no self-respect for them.
Any machine works as we wish.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the light poultry, failed in many of his tests.
Once asked about it, he said, I have found tens of thousands of methods that I cannot produce light poultry.
That is, Edison has turned his failures into his own strength.
It is a coincidence that today I am in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, raising questions against the regime.
As a great sage, he raised the question against every angle of life.
He also discovered the answers and showed the path to humanity.
It is important to know the truth and raise questions again and again.
This is also the real hypocrisy behind the scientific quest.
Why, why, how and how questions don't remain unaware of it.
I extend my greetings to our scientists, scientists and all stakeholders associated with science on National Science Day.
Ravindra Singh from Pune wrote on the NarendraModi App on Occupational Safety i.e. Occupational Safety.
He said that safety standards are not so important in factories and construction workplaces in our country.
On the 4th of March, as National Security Day, the Prime Minister has to speak to the Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat on security, thereby creating awareness about safety.
While we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one being cautious and the other being prepared.
Safety is of two kinds, one is important in disasters, and the other is essential in daily life.
If we say that we are not aware of safety in our daily lives and are not safe then it is difficult to achieve this situation in times of disasters.
Across this, these words do not often benefit our lives.
When we look at natural calamities, most of the difficulties are the result of some of our mistakes.
If we wake up, if we follow the required rules then we can save our lives and protect our society from the greatest heights.
Sometimes we have seen many articles on safety in our workplaces but we have seen that they are not following the right direction.
I would like to urge the municipal corporations and the firefighters to train them once a week in schools and once a month.
This country also includes a number of natural calamities and disasters man-made by the chemicals and factories that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the country's disaster management issue.
Volunteers have been trained in flood prone and cyclone hazardous districts and given the name of hazards.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of people lost their lives due to the heat wave.
Thereafter, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) conducted a mass awareness campaign by organising training workshops on prevention of heat waves.
There was a good outcome with everyones participation.
The number of deaths due to heat wave attacks has come down to about 220 in 2017, below the expectation.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We must become a society that is cautious against danger.
We have been travelling several times and an airplane crew is giving a defence memorandum at the start of the flight.
Well, was there a communication system
This is how we have experience in every sphere of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Mission, emphasis has been laid on waste to wealth and waste to energy in the villages through natural gas.
The initiative undertaken for this purpose is named GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources (GABAR-Agro Resources).
The objective of Gobardhan is to clean the villages, transform the livestock dung, crop residue, fertilizer and natural gas and thereby create wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use livestock feed and bio-waste to produce energy
But India is not fully functioning in this field.
Under the rural programme of Swachh Bharat Mission, we are now moving in this direction.
It has been decided to promote natural energy production through livestock waste, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India should be encouraged and they should look at dust and garbage not just as waste but as a source of wealth.
There will be possibilities of new employment opportunities in waste collection, transportation and natural gas sales.
An e-commerce portal will be established for smooth implementation of the Gobar-Dhan scheme, which will connect farmers with the purchasers and provide the right price for the farmers' crops.
My dear countrymen, to this day we have heard of various festivals like music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a special effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh - the first garbage festival of the state was organised here.
Raipur provided inspiration and other districts also participated in junk festivals for their part.
Everyone shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in their own angle, debated, organised poetry.
Cleanliness is the environment of the festival.
This was amazing, especially when school children took part in it with enthusiasm.
I congratulate the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the administration of Chhattisgarh for hosting this festival in an extremely innovative manner with the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
We celebrate 8th March every year as International Womens Day.
Several events are organised in our country and around the world.
Nari Shakti Puraskar is being conferred on this day to women who have done exemplary work in various fields in the past.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led progress rather than women-led progress.
I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda's penny on this occasion.
Today, it is the duty of each of us to ensure that the contribution of women in every sphere of social and economic conditions is equally balanced.
Today, our women power is expressing soul and self-confidence in their actions.
It is our dream of a New India where women are empowered and partners in all the development of the country.
In just 20 days from 26th January this year, these women have built one lakh seven thousand toilets and set an example, including nearly one lakh women groups.
The women from Jharkhand have demonstrated this thing that the women of Jharkhand have the potential to transform this thing by strengthening the lives of ordinary people for cleanliness and cleanliness.
Brothers and sisters, when I was watching the news two days ago, I got to know that in the three villages of Elephanta Island, how happy they were about to get electricity after 70 years of independence.
I was surprised to know that despite being such an important tourist destination, even near Mumbai, electricity has not reached there for so many years after independence.
For 70 years, there were three villages of Elephanda Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - who had been drowned in darkness, and the light was born.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
What could be a better time for happiness and joy than that, so that the lives of the countrymen become brighter and enriching in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, just a few days ago we celebrated Shivaratri festival.
In March, it is the beauty of the green fields, and the flourishing flour beauty of the herbal crops.
At the same time, this month's Holi festival is close to our hearts.
On 2nd March, the festival of Holi will be celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country.
There is so much significance for colors on the festival of Holi that Holika burns because this is the day when we pour all evils into the fire.
It is a rare time for forgetting all differences, participating in each others happiness, forging unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathi ji has written a long letter to the Narendra Modi App and asked me a lot to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla ji was on her death anniversary on 1st February.
They are not with us today because of the Colombia space shuttle accident, but they have inspired the youth across the globe.
In this context, I express my gratitude to Prakash Ji for introducing his letter by informing him about the passing away of Shri Kalpana Chawla Ji.
It is a matter of great sadness for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age but he has left the message that there is no limit to women power in the whole world, especially in thousands of women of India.
Today, I am glad that women in India are progressing at a rapid pace in every field and are upholding the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, their contribution to society and their contribution have surprised the entire world.
It speaks at length about the greatness of women in our society.
That is why they themselves have given the status of power to women in our society
It shows that women power has always inspired us and glorified the glory of the nation, the wisdom of the Vedas Lopmutra, Karki and Maitreyi, the wisdom of Akka Mahadevi, Meerabai, the ruler of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Lakshmibai.
Prakash Tripathi ji has given many more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ji expressed her heartfelt condolences at the skies flying off Sukoy 30, and said that a group of women from the Indian Navy led by Vartika Joshi is on a world tour to the INSV TARINI.
Three brave women - Bhavana Kand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi - have become fighter drives and are conducting the training of Sukoy 30.
You're absolutely right to say.
Today, women are not only advancing in all walks of life but are also leading.
Today, for the first time in many fields, women power is being understood and a milestone is being established.
In the past days, the President took a new initiative.
Our President called on a group of extraordinary women who made the first time in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, the first female captain of the marine ships, the first female pilot of the passenger train, the first female firefighter, the first female bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to touch the Everest peak, have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the barriers of our women-power and society.
They have proved that with the help of hard work, entrepreneurship and consolidation, they can overcome all hurdles and difficulties and set a new path.
They are inspiring not only from their time but also from generations to generation.
They have filled up a new enthusiasm and a new spirit.
A book has also been written about these women achievers and the women who came first to know about these women powers throughout the country and to inspire them through their lives.
This book is available today in the form of e-book in the NarendraModi App.
Today, the power of women is contributing significantly in the positive changes that are taking place in the country and society.
Today, while we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
You can imagine what can be the connection between a railway station and the empowerment of women.
All the employees of Mumbai's Madunga railway station are women.
This time, after witnessing the Republic Festival Parade, a number of people on Twitter and other social websites are particularly important about the bicycle driving unit of the Border Guard.
They understood the adventures, and the scene surprised the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women power is leading.
Self-reliance is emerging.
I have come across the wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh and they have given a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a definite sight in the minds of all, in which there are forests, paths, in which women carrying heavy burden on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new sight before the nation.
The Dantewada region of Chattisgarh is a region infected by Maoist extremists.
The Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of violence, repression, bombs, guns and bullets.
In such a horrific environment, tribal women have become self-sufficient by drifting rickshaws operated by batteries.
Besides, environmental protection is also being strengthened.
I would also like to congratulate the government administration here that they have contributed immensely in the backdrop of the success of these women from financial assistance to training.
Abandonment of outdated things and adapting changes in what is required.
For centuries, individual and social efforts have been made against social evils and destructions.
A few days ago, a tasty process was undertaken in Bihar.
A human chain of more than 13,000 kms was organised in Bihar to root out social evils.
The movement triggered awareness against evils such as child marriage and dowry atrocities.
All the people of the state decided to fight against dowry atrocities and child marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna to the border of the state, this human chain has remained unconnected.
Our society must get rid of these evils if the benefits of true progress are realized for all sections of the society.
We all pledge to collectively disappear from the society
Let us build a New India, a strong and powerful India.
For the past few years, people have been writing and saying this thing to me.
I have also seen many video films and social media related to the beneficiaries of this scheme.
I was shocked to know that he had got the darshan and that the others should also get the darshan.
The objective behind this scheme is to make healthcare affordable and to promote ease of living.
The cost of medicines available in the public dispensaries is 50 to 90 less than commercialized medicines.
It has the economic benefits of simple people, especially those consumed everyday medicines, thereby enhancing savings.
The generic medicines that are bought here, that is, similar medicines, are in accordance with the standards of WHO.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today the central government has set up more than 3000 Jan AushadhiKendras across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurship has also opened up new opportunities for employment for individuals.
Affordable medicines are available in PM Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana and Amrut shops in hospitals.
The only aim behind all this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh Ji from Maharashtra is sharing a photo on the NarendraModi Mobile App.
That photo attracted me so much.
One of them, along with their grandfather, participated in the mission of Cleaning the Morna River.
Citizens of Akola have taken up Swachh Bharat Mission to clean the Morna River.
Though the Morna River was a 12-month-long river, it has now become a seasonal river.
The other thing that is sad is that the river is full of jungles and waterfalls.
I am told that this cleanliness drive was pursued on 20th January, 2018 and that this mission will continue every Saturday until the Morna River is completely clean.
This shows that if someone has taken the decision to make an effort, he cannot achieve it.
A massive change can also be brought about through a mass movement.
I convey my sincere congratulations to the people of Agola, its district and municipal administration, and to all the citizens who have participated in the people's movement and for this initiative, your efforts will inspire other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, there is an exchange of views on the Padma awards given by the President on Saturday.
Newspapers and televisions are attracted to it.
But just by looking at it, it is a matter of pride for you, it is a matter of great pride for us that we are rich in our magnificence and we are proud to receive awards and recognitions without any recommendation.
Now it is not necessary that a person should be a popular person, but his actions are being identified as his identity.
He has been manufacturing dustbins and sports goods for 40 years, thereby generating scientific temper for children.
It has been his endeavour to ensure that children get scientific experiments using waste material.
For this, he has gone to 3000 schools across the country, screening and encouraging video films made in 18 languages.
Look at what a wonderful life, great dedication
Similar is the life of Sitava Joti of Karnataka.
It is no use calling him a goddess who empowered women.
For the past 30 years, he has contributed immensely in transforming the lives of countless women.
From the seventh year he dedicated himself as a godly servant, and spent all his life for the good of the godly men.
Not only this, he has worked so far for the welfare of underprivileged women.
You might have heard about Bajju Shyam Ji from Madhya Pradesh who was born in a very poor tribal family.
Although he did simple things for his livelihood, he had a rich tribal country on painting.
It is because of this passion that today he has respect not only in India but in the whole world.
His paintings have been displayed in many countries like the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Italy.
Bajju Shyam ji, who is renowned as India in foreign countries, was recognized and honored with the Padma Shri award.
The life of Laxmikutty, a tribal woman from Kerala, can make you a surprising surprise.
Laxmikutty works as a teacher in the Callar area, even today he lives in dense forest areas, in a hut woven with paneola dwelling between tribal settlements.
After snake snake charmers, he is a good manufacturer of medicines.
Laxmi ji is continuously serving society through herbal knowledge.
The Padma Shri award for his contribution to society has been honored by identifying him as an undiscovered person.
Today, I want to mention one more thing and the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistri of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subashini Mistri ji washed utensils and sold vegetables in many homes to build a hospital.
Today, the hospital built by his hard work is providing free treatment to thousands of poor people.
Perhaps in schools and colleges, such people should be invited and shared their experiences.
The society must make some effort beyond all the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate NRI Day.
On the same day, Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate an unbreakable bond between Indians and Indians around the world.
This year we organised a programme for NRIs, in which Parliamentarians and Mayors from across the globe were invited from India.
They participated in Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States.
Some of them have sealed themselves in various fields such as Internet protection, Ayurveda, music, poetry, research on climate change, Indian literature, etc.
Some people have been truck drivers, some have constructed gurudwaras, some have established mosques, some have improved in some way to the countries wherever we are.
I express my gratitude to the members of the European Union for the recognition of the excellent work of NRIs and for the remarkable contribution made by them in providing information to both the world over.
At every step we see how true the teachings of the brother are even today.
And if we are able to fulfil this thing then what else can we offer to him if we decide to go through the mother's feet
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes for the year 2018 to all of you and get an answer from you.
Throughout the year we have shared many things.
Your exchange of letters, ideas and thoughts for Mann Ki Baat has always provided me with a new energy.
A few hours later, the year will change, but our partnership will continue as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated Christmas as a celebration.
We can also see the essence of service mentality.
This shows us the significance of service mentality.
In our country, we talk of 'democratic activity', that is, there is no hope of reflection in such an activity.
It is said that service is the best charity.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
An extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice inspired us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived all his life on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, as a guru, as a poet, philosopher and a great warrior, had worked to inspire people through all these contributions.
He waged a war against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he never gave up his mind to despair.
Every moment of his life, he gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen the uniqueness of such great qualities
This year, I got the opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh ji at Patna Sahib.
Come, let us all learn from the life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and try to improve our lives.
Those who were born in the year 2000 or later, in the 21st century, will become eligible voters in the year 2018.
In the Democracy of India, I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the electors of New India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I urge you all to go and register yourselves as voters.
All over India, as voters of the 21st century, stands for you.
Voting is a very powerful tool for a positive change in the lives of millions.
You will not be empowered to vote.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about our glorious young society, which is 18-25 years old, which is full of dedication and energy.
I consider them the youth of NEW INDIA YOUTH, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the energy and youth of New India.
I am confident that this dream of a New India will be realized by the skills and capabilities of our energyed youth.
When we talk about New India, the New India should be free from the shame of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Must be free from dirt and poverty.
In New India, equal opportunities should be provided to all, everyones aspirations and aspirations should be fulfilled.
Peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding forces in New India.
My young people of India, come forward and study how to set up a New India.
Can the youngsters from the age group of 18 to 25 years sit together to exchange ideas about New India, search for ways and plans
Can we think about how to fulfil our resolutions before 2022
Can we consider building the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement to build the India of the greatest of the 21st century and it is the peoples love for progress.
How to achieve success through conscience
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and making success.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken about the importance of positive thinking.
There is also a case in English - Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
Sharing positive moments of 2017, we will welcome the year 2018 in a constructive manner.
It gives me immense pleasure to note that a large number of people have been sharing and sharing positive responses on social welfare platforms, on the MyGov portal and on the Narendra Modi App.
Lakhs of toilets have been made in Positive India hashtag, which has gone up to more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this widespread spread of positiveness has spread all over the world beginning in India.
The incoming toilets and replies are truly hypocritical.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some people of the country refer to some events of this year which have had a significant impact and a positive impact on their minds.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Meenu Batia.
I live in Phase-One, Face-One, from Mayurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to study.
I needed loans for this and I got it very easily and my daughter was able to pursue studies.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vate.
I'm staying in the clothing.
My husband had given an accidental insurance bill of one rupee per month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life in the accident.
We knew the worst situation we had ever had.
We had a lot of benefits because of the help of the government and we were able to afford it.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our (BHINAR) Badiar Village was constructed in 2017.
Because of this our roads have become very good and our business has started to grow.
My name is Deepansu Ahuja, I live in Satganj in Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish (BEVANI).
For the past 40 years, we have been dependent on the army's drinking water pipe due to lack of water in our area.
Now we have a single water pipeline...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
Many of their actions have led to a positive change in the lives of many.
In fact, this is the New India and this is what we are building together.
Come, let us enter the New Year with these small joys, let us start a New Year and take a firm step towards a positive India from positive India to progressive India.
While all of us talk about positive thoughts, I feel like sharing one thing.
I have heard about the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Cuttack, who was the best qualified in the Kashmir State Governance Exams.
He emerged from the bailout of terrorism and injury and was a stalwart in the state of Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990, the terrorists had burnt his ancestral house.
While extremism and violence crossed, his family was compelled to leave their ancestral soil.
He never gave up hope.
He had set a path for himself - the path to serve the people.
He came beyond adverse conditions and made his own success stories.
Today, he is a source of inspiration not only for Jammu Kashmir but also for all India.
Anjum also demonstrated that however bad the environment may be, through constructive actions, the clouds of disorder can be dissolved.
Last week, there was an opportunity to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
The moments and moments I spent with those women inspired me, this is the strength of the country, these are my young wealth, these are the future of my country.
Every year crores of devotees come to this temple, which is world famous for the blessings of Iyappan.
But Sabarimala temple is an example of how cleanliness can be converted into culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to make peoples participation a force.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched a programme called 'Punniyam Pargangavanam' and started the Swachhta Campaign to spread awareness about cleanliness.
This sacred park parking lot has been so advanced in Sabarimala that Samaria has become a part of every tourist's journey.
And with a lot of hard work, a determined decision related to cleanliness is also being taken together.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on Gandhi Jayanti, we all made a resolution, the unfinished work of Aanchal i. e.
Throughout his brother's life, he spent and made efforts for this work.
On the 150th birth anniversary of his brother, we had resolved to contribute in that direction to dedicate to him a Swachh Bharat, a Swachh Bharat that he dreamt of.
Efforts are being made in a comprehensive manner throughout the country in the direction of cleanliness.
There has been a widespread change in the rural and urban areas due to people-to-people support.
To measure the quality of sanitation in urban areas, the worlds largest survey titled Swachh Survekshan-2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018.
The survey will cover over 40 crore people in over 4000 cities.
Open Defecation Free (ODF) in cities, garbage collection, waste transport vehicle system, scientific waste processing, behavioural transformation, capacity building and innovative initiatives for cleanliness and peoples participation in the work will be the measurements of this study.
According to this study, other groups will visit the cities and conduct surveys.
They will talk to the citizens and get answers from them.
They will review the use of Swachh App and the development of various service centres.
It should also be noted that the cleanliness of the city is natural for the people and whether all the institutions are being established by the cities to make the city natural.
Cleanliness is not merely a government.
Every citizen and civil society plays a major role in this thing.
On the basis of this study, if the standard of cities is determined, if the population of your city is more than one lakh, if there is a national-scale and less than one lakh population then partial level of quality will be provided.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one thing with you through this programme.
It was brought to my notice that if an Islamic woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without Mahram or her male guardian.
When I had heard about it for the first time, how can it be
Why this discrimination emerged.
For years, Islamic women have been subjected to injustice, but there has been no debate.
There is no such provision in many Islamic countries.
But India's Islamic women have been denied this right.
I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps to end the legacy that has continued for 70 years and has removed this control.
I am glad that this time 1300 Muslim women have applied for Haj pilgrimage without men and women from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India and from different parts of the country.
Ministry of Minority Affairs has been instructed to ensure that all women applying for Haj pilgrimage individually.
I can assert with full confidence that the journey of India's development is progressing because of the strength of our women power and their knowledge.
Our sustained effort should be to ensure equal access to manpower and opportunities to women, who can be equally advanced on the path of development.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day for us.
But it will be specially remembered on 26th January, 2018.
Heads of ten ASEAN countries will also be the Chief Guests at this years Republic Day Celebrations.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering today (November 13, 2018).
This has never happened in the history of India.
In 2017, ASEAN and India had a special place.
ASEAN completed 50 years of its partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for us Indians that on 26th January these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will be present here.
Rarely, there will be no pundits on a day or so.
This is the day when all of us celebrated Christmas, the next New Year will be born.
May the coming New Year bring immense joy, happiness and happiness to all.
Let all of us move ahead with a new dimension, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new resolve and progress the country.
In January, Makar Sankranti will be celebrated this month.
This is a time associated with nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is somehow related to nature but in our diverse cultures, this wonderful event of nature is celebrated in different ways.
Lohri's joy in Punjab and Northern states is enhanced, so it is expected that there will be Kutchi and Tila Sankranti in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu all have their own special significance and this has a special significance.
All these festivals are celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
Though these are nominally different, their philosophy is something that is linked to nature and agriculture.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you, my dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
Whether any Indian citizen who does not respect him or who does not respect him is doubtful.
He was older than us, he was a witness at different levels in the country and at different times.
Besides our new generation, this is a great learning experience for all of us and you are a great ideal for us. Despite all these achievements in your life, you have always been primarily dependent on the upliftment and conduct of your parents.
I'm very fond of this feeling.
I really don't want to give you any trouble.
Because I know how busy you are, how busy you work, and how much you're doing.
Mody ji: Yes.
Mody ji: Your love is the reason, we are very happy.
Mr. Modi ji: I am also grateful to you for showing up on me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on my birthday.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought of meeting you.
We will all celebrate innumerable festivals like Navratri Mahotsavam, Karba, Durga Pooja, Dussehra, Deepavali, Baiya Dhuj and Satpura.
In many cities, many NGOs and start-ups of the youth are engaged in this work.
They combine all the dresses, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and search for the needy and bring them to them without any advertisement.
This time, will we drive away the darkness in this season of festivals with full awareness and consciousness.
And the smile on the faces of many poor families shall double your joy in the days of festivities, and your face shall be brighter, and your light shall shine, and your light shall shine, and your light shall be more shining.
My dear brothers and sisters, on Deepawali, a lot of maternal grandchildren and a lot of lives are welcomed at home.
We have traditionally welcomed Mirmas.
Will this time we welcome changes in a new way
In our culture, we salute women in the form of triumphs because women are considered to be good luck and fulfilling.
Can we organize programmes in our society, in our villages, in cities and in our society to honour women
We can organize public events, women with their hard work and hard work will be amongst us, in our families, in our society and in the country.
Can we organise events to honour and honour these sages of India on this occasion of Diwali
We may be among the women who have done extraordinary work.
One may have tried to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some may have been involved in social service like doctors, engineers, educating poor children.
As a lawyer, he may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society must identify such women and take pride in them.
Just as we all worked together to drive a Selfie campaign with our daughters across the world, similarly we will drive the movement of Bharat ki Laxmi.
Encouraging the ladies of India means ensuring a better life for the country and its people.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken about Mann Ki Baat in advance and it is a great advantage for me that I get the opportunity to interact with people who do not know.
In the past days, Alina Thayang, a student from remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote an interesting letter to me.
I belonged to Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when my examination results came, some asked me if you were read by Exam Boards.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I had read this book and read it again and again 2-3 times.
After that, my experience was very sweet.
My childhood student wealthy, thanks to the letter.
Thank you very much for informing me about the grievances being made while studying.
I will obey your orders.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student of Arunachal, Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you will be aware of the uninterrupted events of the Prime Minister of the country through the newspapers and through the TV, you are discussing the situation of non-retirement and non-retirement.
This time Medvede's speech, which was the second in the final race, was so much spoken about victory in the US Open contest.
I also heard a lot of talk on social websites and then watched the dance.
Danny Medvedev's simplicity and magnificence, which had been 23 years old, were all fascinating.
Had he been yet another, he would have been sad and disappointed, but he had no smile on his face, but rather smiled in everyone's thoughts and destitutions through his words.
His speech was greeted by the audience in large numbers.
In one of the contests, the enthusiasm of the loser and the wisdom of the victorious robbed the heart.
If you say that you have not heard Medvedev's speech in Dan, especially to the youth, please go and listen.
There are so many things to learn from all walks of life and ages.
These moments are beyond victory and defeat, and there is no meaning to victory defeat.
Life is a success and our scriptures tell us this thing in a very special way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really wonderful.
Mani Kanchana Samyoga: The joy of Jayanti Lokasya Losan . : If a person's qualification and work becomes the same, he cannot win anyone's heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to say this thing for your direct benefit.
But if we keep awake at the outset and stop them, it can be very safe.
I want to keep this feeling in mind, especially to the younger community.
You all know that tobacco addiction is very bad for health and it becomes very difficult to eliminate that habit.
Tobacco users are more likely to suffer from diseases such as cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
Its adulteration in childhood affects the growth of brain.
But today, I have come to share a new thing with you.
You know, E-Cigarette is now banned in India.
E-Cigarette is a kind of electronic apparatus, which is different from ordinary cigarettes.
A type of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is inserted.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misconception about e-cigarettes has been disseminated.
It means that there is no danger of this e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, there is no odour in it, so they mix a smelling vinegar in it.
If a father smokes in a house then we must have seen that he does not smoke others in that house and he does not want his children to become a habit of smoking like himself.
It will be his endeavor that no one in the family should smoke.
He is very well aware that how much evil will happen to the body by smoking and using tobacco.
The one who smokes knowingly knows this.
But the e-cigarette is not like this.
People don't have so much awareness about e-cigarettes.
They don't know fully about the danger, so sometimes the e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
In fact, e-cigarettes are mixed with a number of bad chemicals, which will adversely affect health.
If anybody in the neighborhood smokes, its smell will betray us.
It is because the dreams of every family should not be treaded on their feet.
Leave the habit of smoking and do not mind any misunderstanding related to e-cigarettes.
Come, let us work together to create a healthy India.
Yeah, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India does not mean that it is not sufficient to travel a gym for two hours in the morning.
It is important to stay away from these things.
I believe that you don't feel bitter about what I'm saying and it's definitely going to happen to you.
They did not live for themselves, they dedicated themselves to others.
He will honour such a great personality in the city of Vedican on October 13.
Sister Mary Treasia, in her short life of 50 years, worked for the welfare of humanity, is a testimony to the entire world.
He had a special contribution in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, 130 crore Indians have once used to take a pledge to get rid of the grave.
In the direction of environment protection, India is leading the entire world in a way, and today the vision of all nations is on India.
I am fully confident that all of you will be participating in the simultaneously utilising Negro on 2nd October.
In many places, people are contributing to this movement in their own unique ways.
But one of the youngsters of our country is conducting a very strange movement.
When I paid my attention to his work, I called him and tried to get him to know about this new test.
For the first time when I heard this word plogging, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word can be used extensively abroad.
Hello Ribuddhaman ji, I salute the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If the 130 crore countrymen had taken a step in this direction then India would have moved 130 crore steps in the direction of getting rid of single use drugs.
Once again, my gratitude to you all.
Moreover, many congratulations to you and your team for such a new imagination.
Dengue.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the 2nd of October, but we want to move on the path of Gandhi Jis 150.
In our lives, we seek to transform and progress the country's interests.
I would like to remind you of something in advance.
I will elaborate on this thing in the next Mann Ki Baat but today, if I say this thing a little bit earlier, will you also have a chance to make preparations for this
You will remember that 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On that day, we will have to run for unity in thousands of villages of India, in thousands of villages, in schools and colleges.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that I had spoken from the Red Fort on 15th August and had asked you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, if possible, one or the other, should set up programmes to stay there.
On the occasion of Deepavali festival, when people are going to visit then I once again urge you to visit some 15 places in India.
And all this has been done only because of your cooperation and this is especially because we have understood the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to all of you in a multifaceted India.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to communicate with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Committee's newspaper Vijay Karnataka published a journal on the boys in which they asked the children to write to the Prime Minister of the country.
They published a few selected letters in the magazine.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Kirti Hegde from Northern Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City initiatives and said that there is a need to transform our education system and there is no country for children on classroom education today and they are more keen to know about nature.
If we give children information about nature then they are likely to be a source of natural conservation in the future.
Rita Nataf, a child from Lakshmeshwara, has written that she is the daughter of a soldier and is proud of her.
Its not surprising that while you are the daughter of a soldier, you are proud of the fact that Irfana Peak from Kalpuri has written that his school is 5 kms from his village.
People of the country, I am glad that a newspaper has taken such a initiative and I have got the opportunity to read these letters.
This was a pleasant experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today, 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
In 1949, today, the Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day when we remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They have worked hard for three years to dissolve the Constitution of India.
Those who read those discussions are well aware of their dedication to the nation in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they have worked to enact a Constitution for our country full of diversity
They did so while the nation was free from slavery with understanding and foresight.
It is the duty of all of us to build a New India by keeping in mind the clear thoughts of those who gave the Constitution with the light of this Constitution.
Our Constitution is very vast.
It does not have an element of unexplored life, it is not a matter of nature.
It is our duty to follow without even a single thread of the Constitution.
We must move ahead by understanding the spirit of the Constitution, be it citizens or rulers.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any role to play.
Today, it is a natural thing to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day.
Seventeen different groups were formed on the important issues of the Constitution.
One of the most important groups is the drafting committee.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He was playing an important role.
Today, we are enjoying the pride of enacting the Constitution of India, and in its formation an unprecedented stamp of the efficient leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
He ensured the benefits of all sections of society.
On the 6th of December, we will always remember and pay our homage to him on his death anniversary.
The role of Babasaheb in making the land self-sufficient and mighty is also worthy of remembering.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was born.
Ediya Sardar Patel had done extraordinary work to transform the country from being a farmer's son to an iron man.
Sardar ji was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was a member of the Consultative Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
Although 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget the 2611 that took place nine years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave citizens, the police, the security forces and all the survivors.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is spread all over the world today, something or the other is happening day by day, in a terrible form.
We have been caught by terrorism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have saved thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India was talking about terrorism on the global stage, when many people of the world took it seriously due to the terror of terrorism, but today when terrorism shuts the gates of their country then the world governments see terrorism as a big challenge.
It is aimed at destroying human forces.
Therefore, not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
This land, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi Ji, has given the world this soil of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are trying to weaken and minimize our social system.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be aware of the human energies.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December we will also celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy protects our coastlines.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all are aware that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Be it the Indus River, the Ganga or the Yamuna or the Saraswati or our rivers are important both in terms of ocean, economy and warfare.
This is our gateway to the entire world.
Their navy played a major role in the expansion of the Chola Empire and making it economically more powerful.
Several examples of the naval invasions and research visits of the Cholas are still present in the literature of the Sangam.
The vast majority of the world's navy had long been permitting women to undertake war operations.
But nearly 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have made a significant contribution in the navy of the Cholas.
Women were also engaged in war.
The Chamoli regime had technical techniques for shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, can we not talk about the opening of the navy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
The coastal beaches of Konkan were dominated by Sivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with the empire of Sivaji Maharaja, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjeera, Swarna Turk, etc. were situated on the shores or surrounded by the sea.
The Maratian army is responsible for the safety of these forts.
The Marathi navy consisted of large ships and small ships.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
After talking about the Maratiya navy, could Kanoji not talk about Angrey
He carried the Maratiya navy to a new summit and set up Marathi naval bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations and rescued many fishermen without drowning and handed them over to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three vessels of our naval ships arrived immediately and delivered relief to the government and the people of that country.
In June, when the Government of Papua New Guinea sent an urgent request to us, our navy helped to protect the fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our Navy has always been proud of the nation, be it providing medical assistance to the country, providing immediate relief, bringing humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries in times of distress.
We Indians have always brought respect and pride to our security forces, be it the army, our navy or the air force, the courage, courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers, to the salutation of every citizen.
The peaceful life of 125 crore countrymen is due to the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
We observe the Army Flag Day every year on 7th December.
Throughout this week, everyone will be flagged off by the small and big.
The campaign of respecting the soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our armed forces.
The funds are being spent on the welfare of the soldiers for the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of those who lost their lives and the injured.
You will be able to know about the various ways of making economic partnerships.
Come, let us use this opportunity and work towards enhancing the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their well-being.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of December is World Health Day.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters some things.
All the food we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is linked to the soil.
Just imagine, if there is no such rich soil that needs to be manufactured in this world then think about it.
Tree plants don't grow, how is human life possible
How are microbes
The farmers of this country are giving a lot of importance to their lives for two things - devotion to the soil, scientifically cherishing it.
It gives us immense pride that while the farmers of our country are associated with the traditions, the country is also a part of modern science, they are striving hard, they are satisfying.
When I visited the Portuguese area of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
Farmers have been using unprecedented chemical fertilizers in the past and soil health has been affected.
The productivity of soil gradually shrinked, with the decline in production and income.
In 2016-17, the crop yield increased by 3-4 times in each acre and income from each acre to 4-6 thousand rupees.
Moreover, the quality of the soil was improved.
Fertilizer consumption has resulted in economic savings.
It gives me immense pleasure and my farmer brothers have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the soil health card and when they see the outcome, their enthusiasm increases.
If we want to pay attention to the crops then first we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the soil then this soil will take care of us.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can easily understand their land and sow them.
We salute Mother Earth, however, have we ever seen how much damage is caused to her by fertilizer like urea
It has been proved in all scientific methods that urea is severely affected due to excessive use of urea.
How can a farmer be able to bear the burden of the earth's sickness, if he gets sick
It is time for this mother-son relationship to be awakened once again.
Can our farmers, our sons and the sons of our motherland resolve to reduce the use of urea by half by 2022 when it will be 75 years of independence
We all began to experience global warming and climate change.
There was a time when Cold Poetry had started before Deepavali.
But even in such a scenario, there are some examples of the consequences in which those who have been awakened for ever and ever.
Tushar, an 8-year-old disabled boy from Madhya Pradesh, has tried to free his villagers from open defecation.
This 8-year-old boy cannot speak, but he has his own weapons of irritation.
He rose up at 5 a.m. and went to his village and woke up his chit and spread the message of not defecating in the open.
Kumhari village got rid of open defecation habits due to this boy who went to 30-40 houses every day and offered education on cleanliness.
This youngster is engaged in the work of inspiring Dushar towards cleanliness.
This shows that I have no age or limit for cleanliness.
Cleanliness is essential for everyone, whether small or big, whether it is men or women, it is essential for everyone to contribute towards cleanliness.
You may recall that our disabled sportspersons have won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics and have emerged as an amphibious T20 World Cricket Champion for the Blind.
There are several competitions going on throughout the country.
Over the last few days, the 17th National Paralyzing Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young disabled brothers and sisters who came from different parts of the country, took part in it and showcased their skills.
One of them is a 19-year-old Jigar Taker from Gujarat who does not have 80 of his body muscles, but look at his courage, his mind and his hard work.
As a result of this capability, he will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat at the time of being one of the 32 paragraphs selected for the 20-20 Paralympics by Sports Authority of India.
I salute the young Jigar Taker and convey my best wishes.
Today special attention is being paid to accessibility and opportunity for persons with disabilities.
A few days later, Eid-e-Milad-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This day was the birth of the great Ambassador Hazrat Mohammad Sahib.
Prime Minister, I am talking to Nirja Singh from Kanpur.
I appeal to you that you will again share ten of the best things you have said in Mann Ki Baat throughout the year.
And if there be elders in our villages, they say always, forget sorrow, and forget not happiness.
We calculate the past over a year, we engage in the concepts of the ideas, beat out the outcomes and prepare plans for the next year.
We are once again trying to recall the interesting events of last year in the media.
This includes a constructive thing and a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, when we are stepping forward, we cannot remember only those things that are good or those that are good, dont remember them
I would like to suggest to all of you - if you hear and see and share 5-10 positive things that you have experienced, you will not feel good.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share 5 positive experiences in our lives this time
I invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a pleasant atmosphere, be it photography or be it films or be it films or be it films or be it songs or be it a small video.
Let us recall the events that inspire others.
Let us remind ourselves of good things and create a better environment.
Good things give us the power to do good things.
Let us together build the strength and impact of this partnership drive.
In my next Mann Ki Baat, I will certainly engage in an effort to bring the things that have come to your countrymen in Positive India.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the next Mann Ki Baat, I will return to you again.
Opportunity to exchange a wide range of issues.
Sath Puja, a sacred day, is celebrated six days after the end of Diwali, is one of the festivals that are celebrated with many appointments and rules.
Traditional appointments are observed in every case as to what to eat and what to wear.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
The entire household is cleaned before Satpuja and everyone joins in the cleanliness of rivers, lakes, water bodies, shrines and holy places.
Solar Puja or Sat-Puja is a celebration of conservation of environment, disease prevention and regulation.
The feeling of destruction of pride lies in the background of this tradition that requires prasadam, which is an obstacle to progress.
It is natural for everyone to take pride in this great heritage of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat is appreciated and criticised.
Let us take the example of garlands and handlooms.
Whenever I hear that such a huge sale has been done in a shop, I feel very happy and happy.
On the occasion of Diwali, about 680 growth has been registered in the sale of Khadi contributors.
The total sales of Khadi and Handicrafts have increased by nearly 90 percent.
Today, it shows that youngsters, elderly and women all over the age group are wearing dresses and handlooms.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families and the families of those who work in handlooms will benefit.
Rajan Patt ji has written to NarendramodiApple that you should share my Deepavali experience with the security forces and tell them how they celebrate Diwali.
All of you must have celebrated Diwali with great enthusiasm.
For me, this time also Deepavali had a special experience.
Once again I got the grief to celebrate Diwali with our respected security forces on the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience to hold Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are defending the nation in the face of extremely difficult and difficult situations on the borders, and I salute each and every one of our security forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
We need to know the experiences of our security forces, listen to their adventures whenever we get the opportunity and opportunity.
Many of us may not be aware that our security forces are engaged not only in our territories but also in the peace process around the world.
As a peacekeeper, they are making India proud all over the world.
For us, we are following the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, a family of the whole world.
India has always been pressurizing women's equality and the United States.
This may seem to be a slight change in overall weight but it shows a negative mind.
If we consider India as one of the largest contributors in terms of its various works then it will be a unique opportunity for the United Nations to contribute to the United Nations.
India has always played a positive role in the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
As of August 2017, Indian soldiers have served around 50 of the worlds 71 peacekeeping operations.
These operations have taken place in all parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, India's military has treated over 20000 patients through medical services.
It is well known that India is the first country to send the first woman police force through the United Nations Peacekeeping Movement in Liberia.
This activity of India is a matter of satisfaction for all the countries of the world.
Only then did all the countries start dispatching their women's police units.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that India is not only engaged in peacekeeping but also in training those who are engaged in the peacekeeping work of about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers have gathered messages of peace and harmony across the globe from this land where Gandhi and Gautama had lived.
Peacekeeping is not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
There are people living in different ways.
Various conditions and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to be modified in accordance with regional demands and environment.
Seeing him, the hearts of all the citizens of the country are filled with pride.
In 1989, he was appointed as Force Commander, 72, in Namibia, who dedicated his services to ensuring Namibia's independence.
As ambassadors of peace, India has always spread messages of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
Though he was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
Nivedita means a complete dedication.
In the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday is the 150th birth anniversary of sister Nivedita.
He was deeply inspired by Swami Vivekananda and quit his comfortable life and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was heart-wrenched by the injustice done by the British.
The British did not only slave our country but they tried to keep us mentally slave.
The work of making our culture degraded and humble in our minds continued.
Sister Nivedita re-established the prestige of Indian culture.
He worked towards mobilizing the people by raising the national awareness.
He went to different countries of the world and gave a loud voice against the false propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and Philosophy.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati has explained in her revolutionary poem 'Innovation' about New Yukuppandir and their balance of balance.
It is said that he was inspired by his sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita has also helped great scientist Jagdishchandra Bose.
He collaborated to publish and propagate Bose's research through his articles and conferences.
One of the most beautiful features of India is concluding spirituality and science.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are examples of this.
In 1899, a terrible Black Disease occurred in Kolkata, causing thousands of deaths.
Sister Nivedita initiated the work of cleaning canals and streets without any consideration for her health.
He may have lived well, but he was engaged in the service of the poor.
He was inspired by this sacrifice and started contributing to the service of the people.
He taught a lesson on the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thanks for your phone call.
It is surprising to hear that children also suffer from diabetes.
In earlier times, they call such diseases Rajarog, which means that such diseases can only come to the rich and well-being people.
Such diseases were rarely seen in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are a lifestyle problem.
One of the main reasons for getting afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the declining physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
It is very important for society and family to focus on these things.
If you look at these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
We must naturally make our old habits slightly different, we can do small things in the right manner.
Children should be in the habit of playing in the open grounds and their family members should make an effort to create awareness.
If possible, the elderly of the family can join these children in sports.
Children may develop a habit of climbing stairs instead of using lifts.
After dinner, everyone in the family can walk alongside the children.
Yoga is very useful especially for our young friends to lead healthy lifestyle and avoid lifestyle disorders.
Before starting the school, you will be able to practice yoga for the first 30 minutes and you will feel how much benefits you will get.
If I say that it is easy to learn and if it is simple then it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for special equipment or fields.
Yoga is very useful in controlling diabetes and many studies have been carried out in this regard.
The study is underway at AIIMS, which is very encouraging to see the results so far.
We should not only treat Ayurveda and Yoga as medicinal treatments but also make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the last few days in the field of sports.
It is because of the excellent performance of our soldiers that after decades we have become the winners of the Asia Cup.
Previously, India won the Asian Cup in 2003 and 2007.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes on my behalf and on behalf of the countrymen.
After Hockey, India has suffered a lot in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth played an excellent role and won the Denmark Open and made India proud.
This is the third Super Series Premiere victory after the Indonesia Open and Australian Open contests.
I congratulate our young sportspersons for this achievement and for making India proud.
Friends, this month FIFA has started the World Cup for the below 17 years.
The teams from all over the world came to India and all showcased their talents in the foothills.
I also got the opportunity to see a dance.
The sportspersons and audiences were encouraging.
The whole world is watching the great event of the World Cup.
When we looked at such a big game, the energy, enthusiasm and the thirst for achieving it, we were filled with despair.
The world cycle began successfully and all the teams displayed their talents very well.
India may not have been able to win, but the young sportspersons of India have won the blessings of all.
All the countries of the world, including India, enjoyed this great festival and attracted a quarterly fan following the whole procession.
Symptoms show that the future of footwear is very bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their helpers and all the sports fans.
My dear countrymen, whenever I look at the number of people writing about Swachh Bharat, if I respect their feelings then I would have to present Mann Ki Baat every day and I would have to dedicate every Mann Ki Baat to cleanliness.
Some are sending photographs of young children's attempts and some are sending information about the group's efforts.
In some cases, some innovation related to cleanliness is being initiated or somebody gets the news about the changes made by an officer's tireless efforts.
In the last few days, a detailed report was given to me about a renaissance story at Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
There, a non-governmental organisation called the Ecological Protection Organization (EPO) was engaged in cleaning the Chandrapur Fort through its entire team.
The campaign that lasted for 200 days, took up the task of cleaning the fort without any rest, without any rest.
200 days in a row.
Your disappointment becomes trustworthy when you see it.
This auspicious effort for cleanliness is a shining example of beauty, social work and sustained efforts.
Fort is a symbol of our tradition.
Our countrymen are responsible for preserving and cleaning historical traditions.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to the Ecological Protection Organization and their entire wear and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we are going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Ji on November 4.
Guru Nanak Devji was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He thought of the interests of humanity as a whole, and used all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He conveyed the message of equality in society, not only confined his message to words but also to his actions.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has given three messages to live a fruitful life - to name God, to work hard and to help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji wrote a sacred book Guru Granth to teach us his teachings.
We will be celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us strive to move ahead on the path of his teachings and message.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrated on October 31 after two days.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's specialty was that he was not only an expression of the idea of change, but also an enabler in implementing it as a very difficult problem.
He was an expert in enforcing his ideas.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel took over the great responsibility of connecting India with one corner.
At the outset, he had promised to bring millions and millions of people under the umbrella of One Nation, One Constitution.
His ability to make decisions enabled him to overcome all obstacles.
This phrase of Sardar ji is still relevant to our dream of a New India and is relevant today.
This is the reason why we observe his birth anniversary as National Integration Day.
His contribution in giving a united form to the nation is unparalleled.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, on 31st October, a Run for Unity is being organised throughout the country in which children, youth, women and all age groups from all over the country are participating.
I also urge you to participate in this run for unity and join the celebrations of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after the Deepavali vacation, with a new determination and a new determination, all of you have started engaging in your daily lives.
My good wishes are with all your dreams.
It has been three years since Mann Ki Baat started speaking to you through Mann Ki Baat.
Today is 36th.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a wonderful opportunity to communicate with the feelings of creativity of India, with the feelings, aspirations and aspirations of all corners of the country in some cases.
You might have noticed that I have never said this thing as the voice of my mind.
Whether it is e-mail or telephone or mygov or be it NarendraModiApp, everything you send is available to me.
Perhaps individual-related disorders, sometimes social problems are drawing attention.
Once a month I take about half an hour of yours but people have been sending me information about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for getting me the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I always remember the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Thereafter, a lot of letters came to me from every place of the country, several social organizations and many youngsters were saying that they were engaged in the non-vegetarian activities.
While watching, Selfie has become a massive movement with the daughters not only in India but also around the world.
This is not the issue of social media.
A new self-confidence and a new pride for every girl child has become an occasion.
Every parent had to take a selfie with his daughter.
Every woman has its own significance.
In the last few days, I attended a session of the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
I asked the travellers to send me photographs of Incredible India wherever you visit.
Lakhs of films came from every corner of India but in a way this became a great asset for the people working in the field of tourism.
Every moment the country is on the right track.
Every citizen of the country wishes to do something constructively for the welfare of others, for the benefit of the society and for the progress of the nation.
In this three year campaign of Mann Ki Baat, I learned, understood and learnt from the people of the country.
This is the biggest capital for any country and the greatest strength.
There has been an increase in the sale of rags and there has been an increase in employment in the households of the poor.
The rebate is substantially relaxed since 2nd October, 2018.
Once again I would like to say that we will take forward the movement related to the papers and strengthen it further.
When we buy Khadars, we have to keep in mind the feeling that Deepavali lights will shine in the houses of the poor.
And that is why we have to do this thing for the poor people of our country.
Increasing interest in Kharads has encouraged the people working in the field of Kharads and the people associated with Kharads in the Government of India to think in a new way.
How to introduce new technologies, how to increase productivity and how to introduce solar equipment.
They have started thinking about how to revive the traditions that have been disappearing since time immemorial for 20-30.
In Uttar Pradesh, Sevapur in Varanasi, the Sevapuri Kadi Ashram, which has been closed for 26 years, has now started functioning with a new team.
That is, we have resolved to celebrate Swachhta throughout the country from the beginning of 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Let the minds of the people be united through cleanliness.
Our Honble President inaugurated this work and the nation united in it.
Today, the elderly, the children, the men and women, the city-villages are connecting themselves as a part of this cleanliness drive.
I had said that we should make a resolve and succeed, this cleanliness drive is moving in the direction of achieving success with the help of our commitment and it is spreading in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it suitable for them, helping them, contributing to accomplishing it.
Sportspersons, film personalities, academics, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, staff, police personnel and soldiers are all associated with this movement.
People ask for cleanliness in public places and there is a kind of pressure on the workers to keep them clean.
This time I had to take note of another thing - cleanliness is one thing and we are not aware of dirtyness.
At the same time, it is important to make cleanliness ourselves natural and to carry out a thought movement.
This time there were several competitions related to Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than 12 crore children participated in the column.
Thousands of children painted with their imagination.
While we are talking about cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media.
They have carried forward this movement with a sense of hygiene.
They have contributed immensely to the creative ecosystem of connecting with each other in a proper manner.
We can see how the e-Madriyas and newspapers of our country are serving the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, one told me about a 18 year old youth from Srinagar, Bill Dar.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, where he has been evacuating plastic, polythene, bottles used and dustbins.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father died of cancer, he joined his life and worked for cleanliness.
Ballal Dar, though younger in age, is an inspiring and inspiring factor for all those interested in cleanliness.
This October is a month to commemorate our great personalities.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, 11th October was the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay.
Nanaji and Deendayal are centuries old this year.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji quit his political career and joined him with the Gramodaya movement and on his centenary celebrations, it is important that we respect his work on Gramodaya.
During his interaction with the youth of India, former President of India, Abdul Kalam will always be presenting the subjects related to rural progress of Nanaji Deshmukh.
And he went to the villages to see Nanaji's work with great respect.
Like Gandhiji, Deendayal Upadhyay Ji will also elaborate on the man in the background of the society.
Deendayal Ji will be remembered for how to change the lives of the poor, the vulnerable, the underprivileged and the deprived sections of society in terms of education and employment.
If we think of these great personalities, if we think of these great personalities, if we think of them then the path goes ahead.
It is necessary that every city of the country should have a massive drive for unity and the weather is comfortable and it is necessary to get the opportunity of iron like Sardar Ji.
Sardar ji united the land of Allah
We should also participate in this drive for unity and take the mantra of unity forward.
We naturally say that unity in diversity is the achievement of India.
While we are proud of diversity, have you been trying to experience this diversity
I would like to repeat to the people of the country, particularly to the younger generation that we are alive.
Enjoy the diversity of our India, feel it and look at its entrance.
You can yourself see that this diversity of our country will become a school for the development of its uniqueness within you.
During holidays and Diwali, there is a feeling of going somewhere around our country.
People from Northern India do not know what is in southern India.
The Westerner does not know what exists in Eastern India.
Do you know how many diversity lies in our country
If you have listened to the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam then one thing will be well known. When they visited India, a new spirit was born to see India, to understand and to dedicate their lives.
All these respected dignitaries visited India completely.
Before their actions, they tried to understand and know India.
They tried to see India live within them.
Can our different states, different communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their ancestors, their ancestors, their food habits and their beliefs be learnt as students, learning, understanding and living
The tourism value adds to our understanding as a student and not stops looking at it.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of India.
The dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat has been fulfilled.
How many types of foods are there
If you have every kind of food in your life then you will not be able to eat the same food again.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these vacations you should leave your house and not just stop for change but also go out with the objective of knowing and getting things.
Your life will be completed through these experiences.
Your perspective will be enlarged.
Tell me, who can be the bigger Asan than your experiences
If you go this time also, you would have taken my movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences and share photos.
Definitely send your photos to incrediblyindia.
If you have to meet the people there then send their photographs.
There is a feeling in my mind - to encourage the tourism sector in India, what are the seven most important tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those seven places of your state, if possible, then you should go to those seven places.
With the help of this, can you provide any information about this
Can we express this on the NarendraModiApp
Would you like to show this in Incredible India
I would like to inform the government about the 7 locations that have been reported in every state in general and publish advertising papers on them.
In a way, how can we take the tourist destinations forward with the views of the people
Similarly, you can think of the places you have visited throughout the country, of which you have the best 7 places, of which others have to look at it, visit it and get information about it. You must send the 7 places you like in MyGov, in NarendraModiApp.
Come, join me.
Between October and March this year, you can become a catalyst for the tourism sector of the country.
I'll call you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you
The event that has happened in the past days, may have come to your attention, in which the countrymen would have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has two bravehearts - Lieutenant Swati and Financial - these are extraordinary brave men.
If I say why extraordinary, the husbands of both Swati and Financial lost their lives in the service of Mother India.
When they fall into the world at this young age, you can imagine how their psychology will be
But the wife of Martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, Swathi Mahadik, confronted such difficult situations and strengthened her heart and joined the Indian Army.
He joined the army for 11 months of rigorous exercise and joined him to realise his husband's dream.
Likewise, Financial Dubey's husband, Mukesh Dubey, was working as a nayak in the army, surviving in the service of the motherland, his wife Nithi, took the urgency to join the army and joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will have respect for these brave-hearts on this mother power.
My dear countrymen, in the midst of Navratri festival and Deepavali, there is a great opportunity for the young people of our country.
The FIFA World Cup is going to be held here for people under 17.
I am confident that the footprints will be echoed on all four sides.
Interest in footprints will increase for each generation.
Everyone should take part in this game so that there are no youth who do not play football in any school-collore ground in India.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives when all the countries of the world come to play on Indian soil.
My dear countrymen, Navratri is taking place.
It is time to worship Mother Durga.
The entire environment is completely dilapidated by sacred smell.
All around, there is a spiritual atmosphere, a festive environment, a devotional atmosphere
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the countrymen and I urge Mother Parashuram to fulfil the aspirations and aspirations of the lives of the common man of the country and to take the country to new heights.
The nation must get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The nation must move forward at a rapid pace and after 75 years of independence in 2022, when it will be 75 years of its independence, when it will be 75 years of its independence, when it will fulfil the dreams of 125 crore Indians, when it will be accomplished by the determination of 125 crore countrymen, when it will be accomplished by the untiring work, the untiring energy and the mind, we will be able to move forward by devising the five year plans for a New India, let Mother Para Shakti bless us.
My best wishes to you all.
Engage in celebrations, spread consolation.
This is the birthplace of Buddha and Gandhi, the land of Sardar Patel, which is a land full of solidarity for the country.
Our forefathers, our forefathers, have been honoured and respected for the values and non-violence that are commonly pursued for centuries.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: We have been hearing this sentence right from our childhood.
This diversity is not only seen as food habits, habitats and clothing.
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organized in accordance with the schedule of nature.
All this is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk to you about the festivals, I would like to say that it is a mourning for all of you.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival yesterday.
The festival of Parushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
This is the last day of the festivals of Parushan.
This is a wonderful tradition.
Samvatsari marks forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
The festival is a symbol of unity, equality and hygiene.
Greetings to the people of our country on the occasion of Pilgrim Chaturthi.
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala.
Keralas Onam Festival is one of the colourful festivals of India.
Nowadays, our festivals and tourism are factors of attraction.
I would like to tell the countrymen that be it Navratri Festival in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal, these are festivals of attraction of tourism in a way.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract foreigners.
In this direction, we have to think about what else we can do.
Id-ul-uha is scheduled to be held in this festival in a few more days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should also be the crucial factors for cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are connected in family life.
Getting ready for the festival is the focus of cleanliness and health.
This is not a new thing for us but it is essential to change it in a social way.
They paint colours, one plants a vegetable, one puts a piece of paper on it.
Every family is doing a variety of things.
In a way, this great exercise of environmental awareness has been witnessed for the first time in this Ganesh Utsav.
Three years ago we started the cleanliness drive and we will complete three years from 2nd October.
The positive consequences are emerging.
Toilets have reached nearly 67 percent from 39 percent.
The people of Jamiat Ulema Ahi Hind have demonstrated an exemplary example of unity and inspiration for all.
If the efforts made with a sense of dedication and dedication towards cleanliness become permanent, then our country cannot achieve any peak.
We will look for opportunities whenever we get the opportunity and where we get the opportunity.
But we have to come together.
We consider this as a kind of production before Deepavali or the production before Navratri or the production before Durga Puja.
Physical service.
We will work together on holidays and Sundays.
We should go to the neighbouring areas, to the neighbouring villages, but we can do this as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental organizations, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district collectors and panchayat leaders - let us create an environment related to cleanliness 15 days before 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, this should indeed be on 2nd October, the dream of Gandhi Ji.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After the construction of the toilet, you can register your name and the name of those who helped you to construct a toilet.
Friends from my social welfare can initiate some constructive movements and you can create a concept to ensure the work at the grassroots level.
A conceptual competition on Swachhta is being organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, a competitive competition, short-producing competition and painting competition.
You can write articles in many languages and there is no age at all.
You can make a short film, you can produce it only on your mobile phone.
It should be a 2-3 minute short film and an inspiration for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
When we celebrate the 2nd of October, after the Swachhta Hi Seva movement of 15 days, when we celebrate the 2nd of October, let us enjoy the cleanliness and joy of the auspicious Gandhian vision.
Hundreds of thousands of people write letters, provide information, and many are reporting through telephone, and this is a treasure of wealth for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the minds of our countrymen.
I wait for your messages more than what you are waiting for for for Mann Ki Baat.
I am thirsty because every thing of yours gives me an opportunity to learn.
Yeah, I myself have made such a mistake.
Sometimes if things change naturally then we will not even tell us how much we are doing wrong.
Prime Minister, I speak from Aparna from Pune.
I would like to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but one of her actions makes me desperate.
Once I went to the business complex to buy things with her.
She spent 2,000 rupees without any difficulty buying a sari, then she spent 450 rupees and bought a beatsa.
But the auto driver who used to come to the campus was involved in a deal worth 5 rupees.
When they bought vegetables on their way back, they bargained at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
It's very difficult for me.
We buy goods without asking any question in big places and fight for the retail money from our hard working brothers and sisters.
After listening to this telephone call, I am sure you might be desperate, I am sure you might even feel ashamed and you might be convinced that I will no longer behave like this.
Have you ever seen what will run in the minds of that poor person
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country will be celebrating Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of Major Dhyan Chand, the Hockey player and the world's sorcerer.
His contribution to Hockey was unparalleled.
I recall this thing that the youth of our country should associate themselves with sports.
Sports must become part of our lives.
As we are the youngest country in the world, we must also reflect on these young sports fields.
What else can we say than physical activity, awakening mentality and personality development.
Sports is an artificial mind-to-hearted approach.
I want to reiterate that the young generation of our country must move forward in the sports world and that too in today's computer world, sports field is more important than computer sports.
The FIFA can play football in the computer, but I'm just a football player in the field.
You can play cricket in a computer, but play under the sky in the field, its joy is unique.
There was a time when all the kids went out of the house and asked when would Mother return
In today's time, how it has changed, when children come home, they sit in a corner and start watching a cartoon film or get drowned in mobile camps.
Any child of the country who has achieved something in the field of sports, if he has the talent then he can provide information or video information on this portal.
The Port will be launched tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to train selected and growing sportspersons.
In India, FIFA is organising a World Football Cup for the age group of 17 from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world come to India and play in India.
Let us welcome the young social guests from many countries through sports festivals, let us enjoy sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, I would like to share with you that event which touched my heart in the last weeks.
Six such women are employed in the Navy.
Their feelings and their inspiration are inspiring for all of us.
These six women's wealth are travelling in a small boat, INS TARINI, and are trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, i. e.
They will roam around the world and return to India after months.
Sometimes they spend about 40 days in water.
Perhaps one could have to spend about 30 days in water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our six women travel by adventure, this is the first time in the world.
I am also organising a way to study and create a way for their experiences at the NarendraModi App.
You must read it because it is a brave story, a self-experienced story and I am very happy to share with you the experiences of this woman's wealth.
My best wishes and good wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan Ji.
Though he was the President, he made himself a teacher throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
He was an attorney, diplomat, President of India, but every moment he lived as a vibrant writer.
I remember him.
This time when we celebrate Teachers Day, shall we all take a pledge together
Due to his efforts, the events that have been successful in transforming someones lives will certainly be in the lives of every teacher.
If we make social efforts then we can bring about a change in the country and we can play a big role in it.
Let's educate and take this mantra forward. Let's move ahead.
Ananya Awasthi.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Institute of Research at Howard University.
As an analyst, I have special interest in financial inclusion, financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you that in 2014 you started the Jan Dhan Yojana. Today, after three years, whether India is financially safer, whether the power is increasing or not, the facilities and facilities have reached to our women, farmers, workers, villages and hungry.
My dear countrymen, the question of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked about the financial inclusion which has been the topic of discussion not only in India but also of experts from all over the world.
On 28th August 2014, I had launched this scheme with a dream in my mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) commenced on 28th August, 2019 and will complete 3 years.
30 crore new households have been added and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the population of many countries of the world.
Sometimes if money is squeezed in hand, if it is in a bag, if it is in a house, it will inspire people to spend waste.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the savings made by the poorest of the poor are 65,000 crore rupees.
In a way this saving of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Those who open bank accounts through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, they get insurance benefits.
Today, a new confidence has been created in the lives of those poor people by paying a simple fee of Rs. 1 rupee and 30 rupees to the Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
If the poor gets a problem because of the fee of one rupee in several families, if the family leader dies then that family gets Rs. 2 lakh.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-Up Scheme, Stand-Up scheme, crores of such youngsters, be it the underprivileged, tribal communities, women, graduated youth or be it the vibrant youth who have stood on their own legs or be it the banking sector or be it the banking sector or be it the banking sector or be it the banking sector
They not only stand on their own feet but are also making successful efforts to provide employment to one or two people.
When some people from the banking sector had come to meet me in the past, they had said that they had got a lot of inspiration when they did a survey of the benefits of the common man because of Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will do my best to bring them to your sight.
It includes events that can be fully utilised by the media.
They can also conduct interviews with such individuals and create a new catalyst for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again, I am extremely sad to all of you.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at Indian Radio, Agil today morning
Monsoon is a time to loot the minds of people.
Animals, birds, plants and nature all flourish because of the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when it rains, we come to know how much water is capable of destroying it.
Mother Nature gives life to us, nurtures us all, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes and their severe forms of destruction.
Changing climate and climate change have adversely impacted.
In some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, due to heavy rainfall, natural calamities had to be encountered over the past few days.
Comprehensive monitoring measures are being undertaken in flood affected areas.
The State Governments are also making great efforts to help those affected by floods in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and also sensitized citizens are making every effort to provide assistance to the people in this environment.
Farming, livestock wealth, infrastructure, roads, power and communication systems are all affected.
In particular, to compensate our farmer brothers for their crops and loss of their produce, we have already made schemes for insurance companies, particularly crop insurance companies, to fulfil their claims immediately.
Besides, the system of 24x7 aid is also being fully operationalized.
People are expressing their difficulties in this regard.
Before the start of the rainy season, training programmes were conducted in majority of the locations and the entire government machinery was kept ready.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were intensified.
In many cases, disaster resilient volunteers organisations were established and trained on what to do, what to do, what to do, how to decide volunteers, create a peoples organisation and act in such situations.
Nowadays, weather has been predicted and technology has grown immensely and space science plays a major role in observing this, due to which we have almost achieved the correct calculations.
Slowly, according to climate forecasts, we have to modify our actions and prevent the disaster prone effects.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see that the people of our country are engaged in the preparation of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, a number of letters and telephone calls have been received regarding the goods and services tax.
Even now people have expressed their happiness and expectation about this goods and services tax.
I would like to hear this telephone call: Honourable Prime Minister, I am talking to Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
A month later, do you have the consequences as you expected
I would like to know about this thing and thank you.
It has been almost a month since the GST was implemented and the results have started to be known.
I can see how this new infrastructure has had an impact in the transport and services sector.
Commodities are also reaching very fast.
Despite this facility, it has also added strength to the economic momentum.
Earlier, due to the separate tax regime, most of the resources of the transport and services sector were spent in maintaining the documents and new warehouses had to be set up in every state.
This tax, which I call Goods and Services Tax, has truly had a very positive impact on our economic system in a very short span of time.
The speed at which changes have taken place, the speed at which new changes have taken place, new registrations have been registered, all these things have created a new confidence throughout the country.
In many of the world universities, this is a model study.
Because such a massive transformation, with the dedication of so many crore people, the successful implementation of this system in such a large country can be considered a great success.
S. D.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All decisions have been taken in a unanimous manner by the States in collaboration with the Central Government.
All these things are available on your mobile phones as to how much the price of a particular commodity was before this configuration and how it was after the restructuring.
This is a historic success and a historic achievement.
This is also in a way a social reform movement.
I salute millions and millions of my countrymen who have made such a great effort very naturally successful.
My dear countrymen, the month marking the revolution in August.
Naturally, we have been hearing this thing from a young age, because of the non-cooperation movement launched on 1st August, 1920.
Then, on 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement began and we know it as the August Revolution.
Next, on 15th August, 1947, the country gained independence.
In a way, many events in the month of August are specially associated with the history of freedom.
This year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But Dr. Thanks to the slogan that this white man should leave.
Only a few people know Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our new generation must know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the historical pages of the people of the country joined themselves in the freedom struggle, bound themselves and bravely braved the atrocities should inspire us to build a glorious India.
What could be a bigger motivation than the sacrifices, penance and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is one of the most important struggles of India's freedom movement.
It was this struggle that gave solidarity to the entire nation to get rid of the British rule.
It was during that period that in every corner of Hindustan, villages, cities, uneducated people, poor and rich people shoulder to shoulder participated in the struggle against the British rule and against the British rule.
The anger of the people was at its peak.
Millions of people listened to the challenge of Gandhi Ji and carried forward the struggle by holding the mantra of Do or Death.
Millions and millions of youth of the country sacrificed their lessons and books in the freedom struggle.
The song of freedom was sounded, they went ahead.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan and other dignitaries have made a significant contribution.
Gandhijis two different angles are reflected in the non-cooperation movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942.
The dimension of non-cooperation differs from that to the extent that in 1942 the freedom struggle grew, we had to put forward the mantra of a respected person like Gandhiji, a mantra of doing or dying.
The freedom struggle that began in 1857 was continued every moment in some part of the country till 1942.
This long period had produced a freedom struggle in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is little depression in sadness.
People continued to come, engage themselves, go, new people came, they joined themselves, burst the British rule and made everyday efforts in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle created a new stage and 1942 took this stage to a higher level.
In 1947, the British had to leave the country for five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, the independent candidate had reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were the expression of the people's solidarity and this five years were the reason for the country's independence.
These five years are determined years.
Now I want to connect with you all.
In 1947, we gained independence.
Today we are in 2017.
About 70 years have passed.
Governments have arrived.
Organisations emerged, transformed, flourished and grown.
Everybody in his own way tried to redeem the nation from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment, eradicate poverty and develop in the country.
Efforts were made in their own ways.
The success was also achieved.
We must celebrate the 15th of August this year as a promise we have made and it will be 75 years since our independence in 2022.
125 crore people of the country, on the 9th of August, on the occasion of Revolution Day, everybody should make a solemn pledge on the 15th of August, as individuals, as individuals, as individuals, as individuals, as individuals, as individuals, as individuals.
Crores of people have to take a pledge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil such promises.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were the determined years of ensuring the country's independence, similarly these five years from 2017 to 2022 will mark the destiny of India.
We are going to celebrate 75 years of our independence after 5 years.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local government organisation, schools, colleges and various organisations should take a pledge to create a New India.
May this be our resolve to succeed in the next five years.
What goal should we achieve as a nation
What can be my contribution as an individual
You can use technology to take forward all the videos, posts, blacksmiths, articles and new ideas.
Let us convert this movement into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will launch the quiz competition for young social friends in the White Field.
This competition is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to make them aware of the heroes of freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread and disseminate this message.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort.
I'm a tool.
I read them myself and I will try to express them on the 15th of August as long as I have time.
There was a charge before me that the speeches I made on August 15 last three times had been a bit longer.
I am trying to make rules for me and I don't know whether I can do it or not.
But I have the desire to make this effort to summarize my speech.
Whether I get success in this or not.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk to you about another thing.
India's economic system includes a socio-economic economy.
We should never underestimate that.
Our festivals and our celebrations are not just an opportunity for happiness.
Our festivals and celebrations are also a movement for social renaissance.
However, each of our pandals has a direct connection with the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
After a few days, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, Pillayar Chaturthi, then Soud Chandra, then Anand Chaturdasi, Durga Puja and Deepavali will come together.
These link individuals and communities.
The natural journey between the two continues.
Ah, ah, a chance to move from my position to our position.
As an economic situation, even months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, many families have started producing rockies as small slum vendors.
Various types of rocks are being manufactured from cotton to silk.
But today people have started enjoying homemade rockets.
It is directly linked to the poor artisans who produce small lamps.
But today while I talk about the festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I also want to clarify the environment.
Sometimes I see the people of the country more aware and constructive than me.
Over the last one month, aware citizens have been writing letters to me about the environment.
You talk about the environmentally friendly child just before the Pilgrim Chaturthi and they have requested me that you can plan to increase the will of the child on the soil from now on.
For the first time, I express my gratitude to such aware citizens.
At the same time, it is our commitment to make the Children who are made of soil suitable for the environment to protect the environment.
This time I have said very long ago
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
Just a few days ago, our women and women achieved a magnificent performance in the Cricket World Cup.
This week I got the opportunity to meet all of them.
I was glad to talk to them, but I was able to realise that they were unable to win the World Cup.
This pressure on their faces, this crisis bore.
I gave a different assessment to those women on my side.
Look, today's period is the media world, expectations are enormous, if you say that if you don't succeed, it turns out to be angry.
If India's sportspersons fail, then we have seen in many sports that the anger of the country is throwing on those sportspersons.
Without stopping, they praised and lauded the achievements made by these women.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially women, has been engaged in many things to make the nation proud.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to the younger generation, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country towards new heights and take it to new heights.
Come on, let's travel together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with the belief that the future of the country will definitely be excellent.
Many-many good wishes.
The weather is changing.
After the rains, the cold winds have given some assurance from the heat of the past days.
Whatever the difficulties faced in life, however difficult it may be, we can feel that in personal life, in public life, the arrival of rain, in the mood of all of us we can make a positive difference.
The poor of the country is connected to Lord Jagannath in a spiritual way.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
In English there is a word juggernaut, which means a special chariot that cannot be stopped by anyone.
On seeing the audience, it was known that Jagannath's 'Jagannatha's 'Radhayatra' has been evolved.
Looking at all these, we can understand how the world has adopted this greatness in their own way.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen and bow down to Lord Jagannath on his pilgrimage.
Come, let us all collectively draw inspiration from these holy festivals and share the glad tidings of happiness and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this auspicious month of Ramlan, we have come to the notice of a massive gathering of people from the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Muslim brothers and sisters living in this small village along with their families, there are a large number of brothers and sisters of Islamic families.
In the month of Ramalan, the villagers decided to build a toilet in collaboration with everyone.
So they said that they should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this auspicious day of Ramzan into social welfare.
We know that Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared as open defecation free states.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the administration, administration and people of these five states.
We are well aware of the fact that we have to work harder to do something better, whether in private life or in social life.
If our signature is bad, if we think it should be corrected then we should take a lot of time and try to do it.
Then it will become a habit both physically and mentally.
Similarly, some other bad habits have become ourselves.
We must draw everyone's attention.
We must remind ourselves of the momentous events.
I am glad that today the cleanliness is not limited to the government level.
This has served as a movement of peoples society.
This happened in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is the target
Out of 71 Gram Panchayats, toilets are being constructed in 10,000 houses in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, the public and the government together have succeeded in constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
in) are coming through letters and through Akashwani.
Recalling the Emergency, Shri Prakash Tripathi said that June 25 is the largest festival in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi is commendable for his awareness of democracy. It is not just a system of democracy but a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
On 25th June, 1975, it is a dark night and no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can dismiss this.
Jayaprakash Narayan and other dignitaries of the country were imprisoned.
Today's media, the students of the world, and all those who work in the democratic system, have been making concerted efforts to remind them of that dark period.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
Atal ji wrote a poem that describes the situation prevailing in the country during that period.
We have to make this tradition even stronger.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels immense pride in building his head.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world was Yoga.
Everyone from water to mountain welcomed the sunrays in the morning through Yoga.
Yoga was not the case earlier, but today Yoga has become a bridge that connects the world with Yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made Yoga an opportunity for them.
In Machu Pichu, the world heritage symbol of the Peru country, more than 4,000 people joined the UAE's Abu Dhabi at an altitude of 2400 meters above sea level.
India-Afghan partner in the Herah of Afghanistan, engaged in Yoga in the Salma Dam, created a new chapter for friendship.
Even in a small place like Singapore, it was organized in 70 places and they started this movement for a week.
This time again Yoga has made the world record.
Nearly 55 thousand people of Ahmedabad in Gujarat have collectively made Yoga and created a new world record.
I also got an opportunity to learn Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time, it has become a good opportunity for Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga arts in Siachen, which has a temperature of 20, 25 and 40 degrees.
Our Army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Guards, Central Reserve Police Forces, Central Industrial Security Forces, all of them performed their duties and performed Yoga.
This is the third International Day of Yoga and I had requested the 3 generations of family members to take a film on Yoga and share it with me.
Some television channels also carried forward the matter.
A lot of people had sent me photographs, some of them were compiled in the Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Dr.
Anil Sonara speaking.
Sir, I recall what you recently said in Kerala that instead of bouquet of flowers at various places, you can give memorable books.
We can't do anything to enforce this idea across the country, sir.
I liked it very much.
I have been reminded once again of one thing that escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we had developed a way that we should no longer provide bouquets, give books or welcome them with a handkerchief.
We will also provide a kitchen because it will encourage the doors.
I had become a habit when I was in Gujarat but after coming from there, this habit has been left out.
But when I went to Kerala, I was again aware of it.
But when we provide books, in a way it becomes a part of the household and becomes a member of the family.
Even if we provide kadar kitchens, we can welcome them. Do you know that how many poor people have been helped by this
The reduction in costs also serves in the right way.
There is a lot of historical significance for these things.
When I was in England last year, ueen Elizabeth had invited me to a banquet in London.
A light was illuminated in his eyes and when I was married, Gandhiji congratulated me and presented this handkerchief, he said in a passionate voice.
Many years have passed, but the queen Elizabeth kept Gandhiji's handkerchief safe.
A little love from Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These behaviours do not turn overnight, but they become critical.
At the same time, efforts should be made to engage in such conversations.
For this, whenever I go anywhere, if someone brings a flower, I will not deny it. I cant do that.
Criticism will only cry, we must repeat, and gradually a change.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country, there are several things.
Despite being immersed in files, I am developing a habit that means, I have been reading some of my letters and making an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come and many people write to me.
I feel that there is a need to share with you a letter I read a few days ago.
Therefore, under the Mudra Yojana, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some goods from the market.
Meanwhile, the Government of India has focused on Government e-Marketplace and Government e-Marketplace.
Those who want to give something to the government - electricity bulbs, dustbins, sweeps, chairs, tables and whatever they want to sell, they can register themselves on this platform.
He can mention what kind of goods he has, what price he can sell and it has been made mandatory for the government departments to visit this platform and buy the goods by considering which goods are available at affordable prices.
All the departments of the government are monitoring the registration of E-GEM.
Due to lack of middlemen, goods are available at affordable prices.
This is the opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
It also has illumination, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I would like that all those who want to sell their products to the government should register themselves on this portal in a big way.
My dear countrymen, while we take pride in Yoga, our achievements in space science also inspire us.
India's greatest significance is that while our footsteps are enshrined in the land connected with Yoga, we are realizing the dream of touching the far flung air.
Over the past days, India has achieved great success in sports or science.
Today, India is seeking its success not only in the earth but also in the air.
Two days ago, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched 30 Nano satellites along with Cartosat-2 satellites.
Apart from India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US.
This Nano Satellite Mission of India will be of great help in obtaining information on agriculture and natural calamities.
Crossing 1000 days is an important milestone in our science journey, in our space journey.
Nowadays, we can see our youth making great strides in the field of sports.
Apart from education, they are also feeling their future in the field of sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, Indian Badminton Player Kidambi Srikanth has made the nation proud by winning the Indonesia Open Games.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his teachings for this achievement.
D.
Sports play a major role in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children in our family are engaged in sports then we should give them an opportunity.
They should not be excluded from the field, locked in the room and urged to study.
Let him study, and make progress in it but if he has greater talent or passion in sports, he should be encouraged by all those in school, college, family and others around him.
Everyone should dream of participating in the next Olympic Games.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the season of rainy season and sustained celebrations is a time to create new kinds of experiences.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all and join you in Mann Ki Baat.
The heat of this year's summer has become an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rain.
Today, while I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the occasion of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
A significant significance has been given to prayers, spirituality and charity in the month of Ramlan.
It is a matter of pride for 1. 25 billion people of our country that India has all the religions in the world.
It is our good fortune that our ancestors have given us this great legacy.
There are those who believe in God, there are those who deny God in this land, there are those who worship God and those who oppose the idol worship.
The art of accompanying different ideas, different forms of worship and traditions is integral to our feelings.
Whether it is religions, methods, philosophy or traditions, the same message that gives us all - peace, unity, harmony.
In this holy month of Ramzan, we will be able to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a lot of people have recorded their backgrounds.
Everyone wants to share their experiences personally with me enthusiastically.
I am speaking with Diksha Kutty.
I decided to study on vacations as the habit of study is almost excluded from me.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles had to be carried out for India's independence and how many struggled martyrs had experienced incarceration.
I am inspired by the life of Bhagat Singh ji, who made the biggest achievement at a very young age, and therefore I urge you all to give a message to the present generation about this thing.
I am glad that the young community is keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters, about the physical, material and spiritual sacrifices for this country.
Innumerable inheritors have lost their youth in prison.
Many young people have kissed the ropes with their faces.
It is because of their unhappiness that we are able to breathe the breath of a free India today.
Those great men who had spent all their time during the freedom struggle, they wrote books, read books, did great things and their writings also contributed greatly to India's independence.
Several years ago, I visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today is the birthday of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmade in jail.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Do you know what atrocities the freedom fighters have endured
When I had to read the book by Savarkar ji, Maji Janmade, I had a desire to visit the cellular jail.
They are organising an audio visual presentation which is very inspiring.
Those who sacrificed their lives in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, known as Kalabani, belonged to all the states, spoke all the languages of India and suffered many hardships.
My dear countrymen, on 5th June, the first Monday of the month.
Well, what's going on with nature
For me, we are connecting us and we are connecting with us.
To connect with nature, to create a better planet.
Who can express it better than Gandhi Ji
Once Gandhiji had said - One must care about a world one will not see, it is our duty to be concerned about a world that we cannot see, that is, to show concern for a world that we cannot see.
You might have experienced that nature has my strength.
Perhaps you have been very tired and if you take water and sprinkle it on your face then think about what kind of freshness you have achieved
A new energy emerges when the famine that produces our body is connected to the famine.
Therefore, on the 5th of June, a world-class movement that connects with nature must become a movement for connecting with us.
The Vedas have portrayed the Earth and the environment as the basis of energy.
In a way, the Atharva Veda gives us the full guidance of the environment, a book of thousands of years old.
: Mata Bhoomi: Budro Ahmed Prudhivya is a case in our country.
It is said in the scriptures that the cleanliness that we have is due to the earth.
In our country, there are many festivals and rituals - those who do not know, those who do not know, those who live in villages, those who live in tribal communities - love for nature is a natural way of life.
However, we need to understand it in contemporary terms and in contemporary terms.
Nowadays many news has come to me from the states.
As soon as there is rain in almost all the states, a massive tree plantation campaign begins.
Crores of trees are being planted.
We also need to contribute more and more to the plantation of trees during this monsoon season.
My dear countrymen, the 21st of June has become the worlds most familiar day.
It is being celebrated by all the world as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time on 21st June, Yoga Day is spread all over the world, connecting the people of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist forces are showing their worst faces in the world, Yoga is the greatest gift that India has given to the world.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world to the shore.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intellect and soul, similarly Yoga can connect the world with it.
Today, due to the lifestyle and urgency, due to increasing responsibilities, due to pressure, life has become very serious.
We also see that this situation has taken place even at a young age.
Yoga will be beneficial for us to lead a stressful life during the period of abduction of uncompromising medicines.
Yoga is a guarantee for both well-being and well-being.
Yoga is not just an exercise.
If we ask you how to take a healthy journey through body, mind, thoughts and habits, we should experience such an inclusive journey then it is possible only through Yoga.
Letters have been written to all the governments and all the leaders of the world on the occasion of Yoga Day two days ago.
Last year I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and some prizes.
Work is progressing gradually in this direction.
I have been advised and I congratulate this basic suggestion.
This is a very interesting thing.
On the occasion of the 3rd International Day of Yoga, I would like to appeal to all the three generations of the family to join hands in Yoga.
Three generations of grandparents, parents, sons and daughters can take up yoga and give up the photograph.
Yesterday, this is going to be a pleasant combination of tomorrow and Yoga will get a new dimension.
Yesterday, it will be tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
Start practicing from today, with the remaining three weeks of International Day of Yoga.
Share, spread and connect people with Yoga for your part.
In a way, it is a pre-emptive health care mission.
I invite you all to join me in this programme.
From that day onwards, I have been touring various parts of India.
I have noticed a lot about Modi's actions.
An interesting telephone call came to me, and I didn't think of it.
But I am grateful to you for instilling a different outlook.
I hope this phone call will be like that for you too.
Naina from Mumbai, Mr. Modi.
Nowadays I have often seen on television and social media that wherever Modi ji is visiting, the people of that place are paying more attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people are listening to your call and are inclusive of cleanliness as a society.
On the one hand, there is also awareness about cleanliness among children.
I have often seen that their elders are filthy on the streets.
After launching a cleanliness drive in Kashi Ghats, you have got inspiration from you and it has taken shape in a very interesting manner.
Wherever I go, the government machinery is performing cleaning work but nowadays it has become a cleanliness festival at the social level.
A substantial amount of cleaning work is being done 5 days, 7 days or 10 days before me.
A few days back I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a massive cleanliness drive.
I didn't see this attached, but only after this phone call came to me, I was persuaded that this thing was right.
Everything is common to welcome the Prime Minister, but it is a matter of great pleasure that the emphasis on cleanliness is being given.
It is an enjoyment and a motivation for those who want cleanliness.
I extend my warm greetings to all those who have been strengthening the cleanliness drive.
One has given me a suggestion.
It's a humorous suggestion.
Whatever idea is good, but I have to think about it.
What is more important is that a movement must be created and I will remove so many tons of garbage dumps rather than gifts.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, has decided to organise a massive campaign related to waste management with the help of city representatives.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, nearly 4000 cities in the country will have access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of trash will be provided, one green, the other blue.
Two types of waste materials emerge - liquid waste and dry waste.
We have to follow the regulation, these dustbins will be placed in 4000 cities, dry waste should be placed in a blue bottle and liquid waste should be placed in a green dump.
Kitchen wastes such as unnecessary vegetables, remaining food, eggs, leaves of trees, etc., should be used in green waste.
If we remember the colourful greenery of the fields, we will remember what to do in the green dustbins.
There is a second kind of garbage that includes paper dumps, cardboards, iron commodities, glass pieces, clothes, plastics, polythene, broken boxes, rubber goods, metals etc. All these should be placed in a dry dump and recycled in machinery.
Versova Beach, considered to be a dirty beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this work, Afroz Shah was awarded the UN Environment Plan- UNEP - the biggest award.
He was the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth.
My dear countrymen, during the last 15 days and months, there have been articles and discussions and analysis of the current government's three-year activities in the newspapers, TV channels and social media.
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
Unified studies have been carried out and a number of opinion polls have come.
I see these as very healthy symptoms.
The last three years have been addressed in every lecture.
People from all walks of life have studied this thing.
This is a special activity in the democratic system.
My clear and enlightened view that the governments are obliged to answer the people in the Democracy must submit their accounts to the people of the Mahesars.
I express my gratitude to all those who have spent their time, analyzed our work in depth, consulted, supported and displayed grievances. I consider these things extremely important.
I also express my gratitude to all those who have made important references to them.
There is a possibility of improvement only when the deficiencies are expressed.
Performance is good, less benefits can be feared, worse, whatever it may be, learn from them and only through this can progress be made.
A constructive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
For a nation with awareness and rationale, this idea and research is very important for a nation of rationality.
My dear countrymen, as an ordinary citizen like you, as an ordinary citizen, as an ordinary citizen, everything affects me just like affecting an ordinary citizen.
Some people consider Mann Ki Baat as a party dialogue and some criticise it politically but I dont think that the Mann Ki Baat programme will transform me into a member of every family of India after a long experience.
I am talking about household affairs while sitting in the middle of some family.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, all those who have held such high offices have given importance to the voice of mankind by sparing their golden time.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
Some of our friends talked to me sometimes while working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I am indebted to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, the next time we meet, the rainy season, the climate change and the results of the exams will change, the education will start again, the new atmosphere of joy, the new smile will be there due to rains.
Let us all come together to love nature and move forward in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
Each time there are so many powerful inputs in Mann Ki Baat, a detailed study is being carried out by the Government.
What kind of complaints are there, what kind of experience is there
We generally see that giving advice to others is the nature of human beings.
It is natural for us to give suggestions and suggestions that if someone gets cough while traveling in trains or buses then it is natural for us to do this thing immediately.
Initially, when there were suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there were suggestions in it, many of them used to think that it might be a habit, but when we tried to approach it, I was really overwhelmed with joy.
After I pointed out, on the Narendra Modi App, on the MyGov portal, all the people from every corner of the country have started using innovative methods to prevent wastage of food.
I have never imagined that the young generation of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been doing it for years but the youth of my country are engaged in it.
Many have sent me videos.
In many places, bread banks are being run.
People bring bread, vegetables from their side, whoever they want and whoever they want, they come and get it.
The supplier is not happy and the buyer does not need to think inferior.
This is an example of how social collaboration works.
Today is the last day of April.
The foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in the month of May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States are continuously striving to scale new heights of development and contribute to the progress of the nation.
In both the states, there has been a continuous emergence of great men and their lives have inspired us in every sphere of society.
Remembering these great souls, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the States and on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, we should take a pledge to uplift our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family.
And we have to move forward with the cooperation of all the citizens to realise that commitment.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of these two states.
There was a time when climate change was the only thing that was spoken at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our everyday life, we are enjoying it and despair is there.
Nature has changed the rules of its movement.
We have experienced this warmth in the months of May-June in our country in the months of March-April this time.
While I was considering the people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, the maximum suggestions were about what we should do during the summer.
Although all things are known or not new, it would be very useful to rethink them at the right time.
Prashant Kumar Mishra, D.
In the balcony, they have asked for water to be placed on the upper floor.
I have seen that even small boys in the family do this thing better.
And if they insist that they should fill the water then they will come out ten times in a day to see if there is water in the vessel.
Not only this, the birds come and drink water and look closely at the snakes.
It may appear to us like a game, but in reality, that pigeon is pouring a wonderful experience of compassion in mind.
Our nervous systems are inherent in our country with birds, animals and nature, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts made at the social level.
It was 100 years since I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat for the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
He lived for 103 years.
To commemorate his 100 years, members of Bohra Community organized a massive campaign to protect the gurus through the Burhani Foundation.
This place was also available in the Guinness World Records Book.
If sometimes we are so busy that we forget to ask whoever comes at the doorstep of our house, whoever sells vegetables, who sells vegetables, whoever comes at the doorstep, whether he drinks a mouthwater in this summer temperature or not.
My young friends, I would like to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place, in a luxury circle.
Mother-father develops them in a very safe manner.
There is a ragam, but most people are in the luxury circle.
Now the examinations have been completed and you people have planned to spend the holidays.
After the heat is over, the summer vacation is a bit sweet.
I would like to give three suggestions to utilise your vacations very well and if all of them are implemented, I would like to do something of them.
Get a new experience, try to achieve a new talent and come to a place where no one has heard, no one has seen, no one knows.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
The test must be constructive, come out of your luxury circle.
We belong to the middle class families, to the comfortable families.
During the evening take your cattle or basket or take other sports goods and take them to the nearby poorest of the poor.
Play with the poor children of that place and you will feel the joy that you people have received while playing in your lives so far.
Have you seen how a big change will be brought about in the lives of those children who are so poor in the society when they get the pleasure of playing with you
If you go once, your mind will want to go there again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteer organizations are engaged in service.
Seek to connect with Google Guru and connect you with some organisation for 15 days or 20 days.
Sometimes a summer camp will be organised, several constructive camps will be run and connect with them.
After you have been selected in such camps, teach the poor who have no chance of learning what you have learnt freely and freely.
You can teach them how to do it.
Though technology seemed to be a means of reducing distances and dismantling boundaries, the adverse consequences of this are erosion of my mind.
Six people are sitting in one room in the same house, but they cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone is immersed in technology.
Social nature is a good value and social nature is a force.
One more thing I have said is about skills, dont you want to learn something new
Sometimes there is also a fear that our younger generation is becoming a robot.
Friends, the dreams that we see in life are all good things.
But we must not interfere with the human ingredients within us, we must be careful not to leave our humanity.
Can we not focus on skill development
We are trying to spend time with us away from technology.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, learn paintings, you can not draw excellent designs, but you can learn swimming in paper
Your feelings will start reflecting in it.
All these capabilities and these activities will make you happy. Not only this, the bonds that have been bound up on one side will also be removed.
Friends, do something differently
This is your opportunity to make your lives.
After the completion of all the examinations, when you came to a new level in your profession then you people said that I am not able to learn all these things.
So I would like to tell you that if there is a magic-learning country then you should learn the ticket table.
Please show this to your friends.
If there is something you don't know, try to learn it and it will definitely benefit you.
Awaken the positive energy within you and it will provide a wonderful base for development.
Friends, we cannot even imagine how many things we have to learn in the world.
There are a lot of new places, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Don't want to travel too much.
Go to Orchha and spend 3-4 days there then go to another place and spend 3-4 days there .
Through this you will get a lot of things to learn.
Friends, this time the Government of India has provided you with a very good opportunity.
New generations have almost released cash transactions.
Whatever you people are involved in it, you can also earn through this scheme and you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with it and if the new person does 3 transactions then you will get 10 rupees for this thing.
10 rupees will be deposited in your accounts by the government.
If you say that you have added 20 people in one day then by evening you will get 200 rupees in your presence.
Businessmen can earn and students can earn income.
The project will be completed by 14th October, 2019.
Let us make your contribution towards creating a Digital India.
You are the custodians of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
PM said, "Shiva Choubey is from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to talk about the rotating red light.
I don't want to get stuck in traffic jam and I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision taken by you people.
Whatever the government's decision to abolish the red light is an institutional measure.
But we have to root out this culture that is rooted in our minds.
If all of us work together to create awareness, this can be overcome.
My aim is clear - Ever Parson is Impartant - everyone is important.
Every individual has a great significance. If we recognize the importance of 125 crore people, if we realise the greatness of 125 crore people then it will be a great power to realise even the greatest dreams.
We all have to collectively do this.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the great Ramanujacharya, the 125 crore countrymen.
For some reason we got stuck in the pockets, we were very small, and we became more accustomed to the centuries.
Century is also considered to be very important in other countries of the world.
Just imagine.
Even today how difficult it is to break the social stance
How could it have been a thousand years ago
It is known to some that Mamanujer unleashed a great struggle against the social odds, the feeling of the superior and the underprivileged, the untouchables and castes.
He embraced the person whom the society considered untouchable and performed through his actions.
Thousands of years ago, he had organised a campaign for their temple entry and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will release a commemorative postal stamp tomorrow on 1st May to commemorate the holy Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Shri Ramanujacharya and offer flowers of my devotion.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is another significance from the 1st of May.
In many parts of the world, labourers have adopted it as a day.
When working people talk of day, labour and labour, I am naturally reminded of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions and respect given to the labourers.
Baba Sahebs contribution towards the welfare of the working class is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb, when we talk about Saint Shri Ramanujacharya then I got the opportunity to recall the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka who lived in the 12th century.
He also got the opportunity to release a compilation of his phrases.
In Kannada language of the twelfth century, he spoke deeply about labour and labour.
In Kannada, he had called Gaya Kave Kailash, which means that only through labour you can achieve Lord Shiva's legacy, that is, by working only heaven gets it.
When we talk about labourers, it is natural to think about them.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world celebrate this festival.
Lord Buddha's views are very relevant when the world looks at violence, war, destruction and arms conflict today.
It is an excellent example of Ashok's life in India that Buddha is quitting the war.
The United Nations celebrates this Great Day of Buddha Purnima.
This year, the festival will be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I have got the opportunity to dedicate the flowers of my homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbours.
We want to be in harmony with our neighbouring countries and also to move forward.
There are many possibilities
India will launch South Asia Satellite on May 5.
The capacity and facilitation of the satellite will be of substantial help to the economic and development activities in South Asia.
This is a good example of our vision for South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are associated with the preparations for the selection of their children.
Today is 26th March.
It is a matter of pride for us that Rabindranath Tagore and all his memories are commemorated by us.
In 1919, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre was unleashed and at that time Rabindranath Tagore was one of the dignitaries who gave a loud voice against the massacre.
The massacre had a profound impact on the minds of a twelve-year-old boy.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukhdev and Rajguru.
On the 23rd of March, when the tragedy took place, there was no fear of death in the faces of martyrs like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three people are still a source of imagination for us.
We cannot break the ear of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British Empire trembled on seeing the three.
They were imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the British were worrying about how to treat them.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to visit that place for the first time then I felt a kind of shock on that soil.
Whenever you have the opportunity to visit Punjab, I urge the youth of the country to visit the place where the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagwad Singh Ji and Bhatkeshwar Dutt are located.
It was a period of independence and its intensity.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were inspiring the youth to take up armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April 1917, Gandhijis Champaran Satyagraha was organised.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the expression of Gandhijis thoughts and methods of Gandhi Ji was revealed in the freedom struggle of India.
This was a turning point in the freedom struggle journey, particularly from the point of view of methods of struggle.
Champaran Satyagraham, Kheda Satyagraham and the Mill Workers' Strike in Ahmedabad were all beginning to have a profound impact on Gandhiji's ideas and methods.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from his neighbourhood and in 1917 went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot assess the Champaran Satyagraha with regard to Gandhiji in our minds.
Just imagine, a man who returned to India in 1915 had only two years of experience.
He highlighted the extraordinary strength of Gandhijis integration through Champaran Satyagraha, the ability to know the vibrancy of Indian society, the power to inspire people who were extremely poor and illiterate, and to invite them to the battleground.
We can learn from him how to start public life, how to work for it, how Gandhiji worked.
The great leaders of that period, such as Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani, used to visit Gandhijis village.
He learnt how to connect with the people and how to associate their work with the freedom struggle.
Today we are travelling in the 21st century, who does not want to change India in today's era, who does not want to participate in the transformation of any Indian
These efforts of 125 crore countrymen, their efforts for transformation will be a strong foundation for creating a New India.
New India is not a government scheme.
New India is the challenge of 1. 25 billion people of the country.
This is the feeling of building a New India together with 1. 25 billion people.
This is a desire, a desire, a feeling and a thirst that is deep in the hearts of 1. 25 billion people of the country.
Peacefully, they are working like penance makers.
Some people go to the hospital every day and help the patients.
There are many donors who run and donate blood as soon as they hear what is needed.
There are many people who starve and do good work to feed them.
Our country is a land full of such valueless values.
People say service is message service, it is everything in our nervous system.
If we look at this thing as a whole, if we look at it in an integrated manner then how great a force it is.
When we talk about New India, it is a natural thing to raise criticism of this view that is acceptable in a democratic way.
But if the 125 crore countrymen decide their path, if they start stepping forward one by one then the dream of 125 crore countrymen of cooking a New India will begin to realise when we keep looking at it.
There is no need for all things to be included in the budget or the government's plan or the government's money to be spent.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country should perform his or her duties as a citizen and he should feel responsibilities.
Why shouldn't we take this journey of self-reliance with regulation and determination
I invite you to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you today.
Over the last few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in the Digital Payments Digital India Mission.
Digital payment system has seen a lot of improvements following the withdrawal of currency.
It has been 2-3 months since we started the BHIM App, so far about 1. 5 crore people have availed it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Could 125 crore Indians be able to fulfil this year's commitment to digitally transact 2 million and 1.
In order to implement this, we can digitally pay school fees, we can digitally afford travel tickets, buy medicines digitally and if we run cheap food stores then we can take digital payments.
In the past, several programmes for Digital Celebrations were organised to spread awareness among the people.
It was resolved to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won their prizes.
Everyone took a pledge to take this task forward.
A massive movement is also being organised.
I am confident that we will create awareness about BHIM App, how long it has been possible for Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birthday.
Our contribution must be to reduce the use of cash.
Friends, every time I request you to give your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat programme and give me several suggestions.
But I can see that in your suggestions, you are always putting a lot of pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through Rispana Bridge and it runs around my house.
We tried to create awareness among the people about the pollution of the river and travelling in parts of the country but this did not help.
I urge you people that you have sent a team from your side or through the newspapers to create awareness about this thing.
Brothers and sisters, Look at the pain that a student of class 11 has in his mind.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has also emerged since the launch of the Swachhta Mission.
Everyone has made a positive integration into it.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
The hatred against uncleanness has been rising.
Be it awareness or constructive participation or movement, the importance of these things is definitely there.
Though it's hard to do, we have to do it.
I am hopeful that this feeling that has emerged among the new generation, youngsters, students and youth of the country indicates a good sign.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, everybody who has been listening to Gayatri's message, I want to tell all of them that the message that Gayatri has given us must be fulfilled.
Ladies and Gentlemen, since the beginning of Mann Ki Baat programme, I have had several suggestions on wasting food.
We all know that while we are eating in our homes and public functions, we take more food to our folds than is required.
Have we ever imagined how much damage is caused by the remnants that we leave
If we don't survive, how many poor people do you think it will help in feeding
However, the indifference in this matter is a great deal of treachery against society.
This is an injustice done against the poor.
On the other hand, if the food is not wasted, it will be saved and the family will be benefited economically.
This is a good thing while thinking socially but it is a family-wise thing that is beneficial.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youngsters who are running a mobile app and are running it.
If any food is left out, they will be informed, they will collect the remaining food and distribute it to the needy.
Our youngsters are working towards this endeavour to make good use of food.
You can meet such people anywhere in every state of India.
Look at the ways of change.
Those who are aware about health, they always say that they should keep the leaves a little less and fill their stomach a little less.
World Health Day on 7th April
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage for all by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 crore people around the world have been affected by depression.
Friends, talk to your parents, brothers and sisters openly to teachers and talk to them as per your inner strength.
Have you seen at least why they are acting like this
You must understand that they are in the first step of depression.
Depression aggravates mental and physical illnesses.
Just as diabetes provides a comfortable base for all kinds of diseases, similarly depression paralyses all our capabilities such as the strength to bear, the strength to fight against harsh conditions, the equilibrium and the ability to decide.
If you are not able to speak openly to those who are related to you people, please engage with the spirit of service at some place near you.
You can clearly see your grief disappearing on your own, please serve with full dedication, participate in their comfort and sadness.
If you try to understand the grief of others, if you do that thing with the spirit of service, then a self-confidence will spread among you.
By interacting with others and by doing selfless service to others, you can easily discharge the burden of your mind.
Similarly, Yoga is a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You should start your efforts from now on.
Ensure that hundreds of thousands of people participate in Yoga Day socially.
If you have any suggestions on the 3rd International Day of Yoga then you must send me your suggestions through the mobile app and guide me.
You can produce songs and works related to Yoga and it can enhance the understanding of people.
Today I would like to talk to my mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about several things about health.
The government has taken a major decision in the past few days.
It is a welcome thing that the number of women going to work in our country is increasing day by day and their contribution is increasing.
My dear countrymen, the holy Rama Navami on April 5th, Mahavir Jayanti on April 9th and Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14th.
May the lives of these great souls always inspire us and consolidate us for the cooking of New India.
After the spring season, the crops will start growing and the farmers will get the benefits for their hard work.
In many corners of our country, this new bridge is celebrated in many ways.
My best wishes to you all for the New Year.
Snow is now disappearing.
The spring season is also witnessing its arrival in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new turtles have started blossoming in the trees, flowers bloom, forests, gardens and drains are pouring greenery.
Not only flowers but also fruits shine in the heart of the adventurous.
Mangani's pigeons have started to appear in the spring season.
The yellow flowers of mustard in the fields give confidence to the farmers.
Flowers of flowers of flowers of flowers of flowers call the occasion of Holi festival.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change very tastefully.
The fields bloom everywhere, the marbles bloom, the flowers bloom, the wells smell Kuku Kukuwen, the atmosphere becomes comfortable when it blossoms in the organic domes, the man enjoys the sweetness of this environment.
Vasantha Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals reflect the joyous flowers of human life.
In an atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to complete the month of Bhatni and we are preparing to welcome the month of New Year.
The spring season is a combination of these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions in front of Mann Ki Baat, I first express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for sending me a lot of suggestions.
Thanks to all of you who have contributed in all forms on the Narendra Modi App, on Twitter, on the Facebook and through letters.
Shoba Jalan ji has said that many people do not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further asked you to provide information about 104 satellites and interception missiles.
Thank you very much for recalling the example of Shobaji and Indias pride.
Our scientists have braved India in the global arena.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many amazing achievements in the last few years.
Just a few days ago, ISRO has made a new world record in the space sector, after Mangalyaan was successfully dispatched to Mars as part of its plan to travel to Mars.
A total of 104 satellites of several countries have been successfully launched at a time.
This is a great historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISROs low-cost space programme is one of the wonders of the entire world and the entire world is appreciating the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is of great significance - Cartosat 2D - this will be India's satellite and will prove to be beneficial for mineral resource identification, infrastructure development assessment and planning for urban development.
In particular, our new satellite Cartosat 2D will be beneficial for my farmer brothers and sisters to know about the number of water resources in the country, how they can be used and what should be kept in mind.
As soon as we have reached, our satellite has sent some films.
It has started working on its own.
It is a matter of great happiness for all of us that all these activities have been led by our young social scientists and our women scientists.
The contribution of young scientists and women scientists is a matter of great pride for ISROs success.
My countrymen, on your side, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all ISRO scientists.
Your vision of sustaining the goal of space science keeping in mind the work of the people and the country's work, you are making new achievements every day for sustaining this goal as it is today.
Whatever the appreciation and appreciation of our scientists and their entire team, all of them are inadequate.
India has successfully tested a cross-continent Missile Missile Missile.
This is a huge achievement in the defence sector.
You will be happy to note that the world has only four and a half countries with this technology capability.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though a missile is coming to attack India from a distance, it is capable of destroying it in our missile.
When we see new technologies, when we see some new scientific achievement then our people feel happy.
In the larger world, man's mind has been striving hard to know the laws of the creation.
New science and new technology are born of this.
Every technology has created a new era in the form of every new science.
My dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often spoken to Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation must be attracted towards science.
Many scientists need the nation.
Scientists today are the factors of a stable change in the lives of generations that will emerge in the coming ages.
None of the sciences jumped from heaven in perfect terms.
Gandhiji used to say that all scientific achievements are immersed in experience.
Respected Babu ji has said that working hard should appreciate the thirst, dedication and sacrifice of our neologists.
The need of the public is to understand how to adapt principles to practice, what tools and what to do with technology, so that it becomes an important role for the common man.
Over the past days, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India have organised a unique competition on the occasion of the 14th NRI Day.
In Mumbai, in 2005, heavy rains, floods, seas and furious scenes were overwhelming.
Whatever natural calamity happens, it is the doors of the poor household.
Two people decided to find a solution to this, they rescued the house for a long time and developed a house that protects the households from floods and also protects them from water-borne diseases.
I could see many such innovations.
I would like to say that many people have contributed to this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a technology driven society.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
Digital emphasis has been given over the past days.
Gradually people are moving from cash transactions to digital payments.
Digital payments in India is growing rapidly.
In particular, young people are getting used to digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
In the last few days, our country has received a lot of welcome from Lakhi Grahak Yojana, Lucky Consumer Scheme, Digital Business Programme and Digital Business Programme.
About two months ago, a reward of 1,000 rupees per day has been given to 15000 people.
Through these two schemes, Digital Procurement in India is becoming a peoples movement and the entire nation has welcomed it both.
It is a matter of satisfaction that so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded, more than 50,000 businessmen have been rewarded, more than Rs. 5 crore has been given to those who have taken part in these schemes.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh traders have received a reward of Rs.
More than 4000 merchants have received a reward of 50,000 rupees per day.
Farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, professionals, home-makers and students have been associated with this thing with great enthusiasm and they have also benefitted from it.
When I looked at it, it was known that not only the youth but also the elderly had participated in it, including a 15-year-old boy and a 65-70 year old senior citizen.
Santosh ji has expressed his happiness on the Narendra Modi App from Mysore, which has given him 1000 rupees through the Lucky Clients Programme.
But I would like to share with you what is important in his writings.
Santosh ji, your name and your work make us all happy.
You have done a great job of inspiration.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his business after demonetization and has got a reward of one lakh rupees in the government's fortnightly customer scheme.
Today, even if he drives a car, he has become the ambassador of this scheme in a way.
He shares information on digital payments with all travellers travelling in his car.
He is enthusiastically encouraging and encouraging others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, shares his experiences with his friends about how his family uses RuPay card and e-wallet and how they feel happy.
Come to lead this movement.
If you take it forward then it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
In my view, all those who are associated with this task are the new warriors against corruption.
In a way you are the fighters of honesty.
On 14th April, the biggest prize summit will be held.
There are still 40-45 days left.
Can you do one thing in the memory of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days ago, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary had passed.
Learn at least 125 people to upgrade BHIM App to commemorate his memory.
May this time be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and BHIM App and specially important
I would also like to mention that we should strengthen the foundation stone of Babasaheb's construction.
You must ensure that BHIM app reaches the hands of 1. 25 billion people of the country by connecting them with it at home.
As a result of the impact of this movement in the last 2-3 months, several cities and villages have been hit by a massive scale.
Ladies and Gentlemen, agriculture is the cornerstone of our economic system.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a joyous story with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill the store.
This year, due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, there has been an unprecedented yield.
All the indicators indicate that our farmer brothers and sisters have defeated old achievements.
On seeing the palaces, everyday there is a feeling that today we are celebrating the festival of Pongal and Baisakhi.
This year, more than 2,200 million tonnes of pulses have been obtained.
This is 8 higher than the last achievement of our farmers.
This is a surprising achievement accordingly.
I would particularly like to thank the farmers of the country.
There is another reason to thank the farmers - they have also cultivated a variety of pulses, besides producing traditional crops because there is a lot of protein in pulses.
In my country's farmers' ears, the voice of the poor is heard, they have produced many types of pulses in about 200 hectares of land.
This is not just a product of pulses but a great service to the farmers of my country.
I would like to express my gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have made a mark in the field of pulses by listening to one of my requests.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, in our country, everybody is moving towards cleanliness through the government, through the society, through the organisation and movement.
In a way, everybody has been aware of cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government is making constant efforts.
In the last few days, an event of senior officers of 23 State Governments under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation was held in Telangana.
The seminar did not take place within the closed rooms of the Weekly Week in Telangana, but was an important part of what was the importance of cleanliness at the grassroots level.
In February 17-18, the exercise to make toilets empty was started in Hyderabad.
Officials showed that the toilets in 6 houses were empty and they were cleaned and removed from two-house toilets and how they could be reused.
They have shown how convenient the toilets used by this new technique, how difficult it is to clean them from emptying to cleaning, there is no problem, there is no psychological barrier, there is no obstacle.
Just like we are cleaning the toilets in a simple way, we can also clean the toilets.
An average twin pitcher toilet for a family of 6 members will be filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily evacuated and returned to the second bastion.
The number of things that are highlighted in it will be of immense benefit.
Even in the government, different departments have been organising regular cleanliness related meetings for the fortnights related to cleanliness.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Tribal Affairs will join the first meeting in March to strengthen the Swachhta drive.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will jointly carry forward the Swachhta drive for the last two weeks of March.
Any citizen of our country who does good work, the entire nation feels a new energy and enriches self-confidence.
In Rio Paralympics, we welcomed the adventures of our alternate sportspersons.
India defeated Pakistan in the final match of the T20 World Cup for visually impaired organised this month and became a world champion for the second time.
Once again I congratulate all the soldiers of the team.
We are proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends in the country.
I have always believed that our disabled brothers and sisters are highly skilled, dedicated, accomplished and have a mind-set.
We have to learn from them every moment.
Whether it is related to the field of sports or be it space science, the women of our country are not proud of anyone.
They are moving forward like a synonym, they have been illuminating the country with their achievements.
Our women garrisons have won silver medals in the last few days for the Asian Raqbi Sevens shield.
My heartiest congratulations to all these valorous people.
World Women's Day will be celebrated on 8th March.
In India as well as in India, there should be greater awareness and understanding among the family and the society, to give importance to the girl child.
Today it is not just a government scheme.
It has served as a social understanding, a movement of education for all.
Over the years, this scheme has connected the peoples society, this important thing has been kept in mind in every corner of the country and has changed the mindset of the people over the years of old habits.
When the ears fall, there is a lot of joy in the mind that there are celebrations to hear that a girl child is born.
In a way, positive thinking about girl child is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that due to a special mission in Tamil Nadu district, Balya Vivah was stopped.
So far, more than 175 slave marriages have been blocked.
The district administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand girl children under the Suganya Samrudhi scheme.
Under the Convergence Model (Integration Model) in Kawa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the sectors are being linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme, Gram Sabhas are being convened and comprehensive efforts are being made to ensure adoption and education of orphaned girls through district administration.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mission is being undertaken to educate the girl child of every household in every village as per the scheme of laying down every door.
In Rajasthan, our children, our school and the mission is being carried out to re-enroll and engage with the girls who have half-school education.
I mean to say that the mission of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has been working on various forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It connects with innovative ideas.
This is being revised as per regional requirements.
I consider this as a good sign.
On the occasion of Womens Day on 8th March, we should be united, we should be conscious. Our women of India, they are not less or less of strength. All of them, my dear countrymen, you all get the opportunity to talk about something in Mann Ki Baat, sometimes or the other.
You have come together in a constructive way.
I have got a lot of things to learn from you.
Everything that brings me to the world, to the villages, to the poor people's mind.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our ancestors have made the system of cycle, economic cycle and social life excellent so that there is never a recession in society under any circumstances.
In the last few days, we have celebrated many festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival is filling the new energy with a new pole and enthusiasm.
Sometimes he rocked the mountain, sometimes he took up the task of eliminating the edible leaves, that is, we can feel a new thing in his every activity.
And that is why today when I talk to you, my thinking goes to the milk of two Mohans.
One is Mohan who bears the Sudarshan Chakra, the other is Mohan who bears the Sarka.
Mohan, who bears the Sudarshan wheel, sweeped off the banks of the Yamuna, went to the shores of Gujarat and settled in the city of Dwaraka, but Mohano, who appeared on the coasts of the sea, came to the banks of the Yamuna and breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who bears the Sudarshan wheel, used his intellectual obligations, his ability and his ideas to avoid war and live freely in accordance with the circumstances of that period, even thousands of years ago.
At the same time, Mohano, who stood by the Sarkar, gave a new shape to the freedom struggle, to defend the values of the country, to empower the fundamental elements of personality and to make the entire world a unique turning point, which is still unique.
What is the significance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the importance of moving ahead with smile amidst all the fluctuations of life
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is celebrating a massive festival
Not only India but the entire world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the 2nd of October 1869, at Porbandar on the coast of the sea, an era was born not an individual but an individual in a small house called Keerthi Mandir.
This gave a new dimension to the entire human history and made a new achievement.
In a way, it became a permanent part of his life - service, sensitivity and duties towards service.
If we had seen all his life then he was involved in serving people from different societies in South Africa, sir, in that period it was not a small thing.
He served the oppressed farmers in Champaran.
Anyone who needs help at any point of time will be helpful in serving.
He not only strengthened the service, but also strengthened the spiritual well-being of service.
But along with this, the experience of a self-sufficient sense of joy and swatha suhaya is also enshrined in the service.
We can clearly understand this through the life of our brother.
For Gandhiji, individuals, individuals, individuals, individuals, individuals and individuals are all things.
Whether it is Africa's phoenix farm or Dalstoy farm, be it Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha, he has always strengthened his social mobilisation in a different way.
I believe that I have got the opportunity to pay my homage to many important places related to my brotherhood and I have the greatest privilege of paying my tribute there.
Whenever there is a society, there is a strength for it and there should be a social outcome and service in this programme of Gandhi 150.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat appears, it must be a good desire, a good intention, a harmonious service, a complete dedication and a swatha: swatha href"http:www.
My dear countrymen, a few months back, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Tandi, the name of the Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a big turning point.
At Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to the brotherhood.
I request you all to visit some place associated with Gandhi Ji.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions are planned in the coming days.
But on this occasion, I would like to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, in Venice Biennale, many interesting scenes of Gandhiji's memories are being seen in the Indian Museum.
The area of Haripura is specially interesting.
You may recall that during the Haripura Congress convention in Gujarat, the event that was chosen as the President of Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
There is a very beautiful past in these arts.
In 1937-38, before the Congress Haripura conference, Nandlal Bose was invited by the then Chief Minister of Shantiniketan's Kala Bhavana.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art, this artwork should be exhibited at the convention.
This is the handiwork of Nandla Bose which enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited villages around Haripura and composed paintings to showcase rural life.
There were intense discussions in Venice about these invaluable works.
Once again, with the best wishes of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I expect every Indian to take some solemn pledge.
We have to do something for the country, for the society and for some good thing.
This will be a good and real tribute to our brother-in-law.
Welcome to Mother India, you all may recall that in the last few years we have been organising Swachhta Hi Seva for two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
All sections of the society have a lot of enthusiasm in this movement.
My brothers and sisters of mine have hung a table in their shops and they have written that the customers should come out of their homes with clothing.
This will save money and our contribution in protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of our brotherhood, we will dedicate to him the Open Defecation Free India, while also laying the foundation for a New Peoples Movement against Negro Products across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to every small area and to the people of the country, to pay my obeisance to Kakupi and this year we should celebrate Gandhi Jayanti with the aim of liberating this mother India from erosion.
I also urge the private companies to come forward to favourably remove so many of these pesticides after they have been collected.
They can be recycled.
Fuel can be manufactured through these.
But there was a lot in the past.
Today, I would like to touch upon a matter of greater significance than a summary of gold.
Even though it was written centuries ago, how important it is today
The fools are known as gems.
Food has always been given a lot of importance in our culture.
So far, we have scientificized the knowledge of food.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and children, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
Nutrition through Nutrition Mission (NM) is becoming a peoples movement and nutrition through modern methods across the country.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once something was brought to my attention.
In Nasik, there was a massive movement called Crocodile.
Anganwadi sisters are collecting a handful of grains from the people during the harvest days.
These grains are useful for warm food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is done for the first time when a child is being given solid food.
Not liquid food, solid food.
This is a wonderful effort, it can be executed everywhere.
In many states, people are organising a movement called 'Pakdi Divas'.
The family goes to Anganwadi by preparing nutritious food and tasty food and goes to schools where the family members themselves serve and feed their children.
They share their happiness and it will not be less when the happiness is shared.
Enjoyment with the spirit of service is a wonderful confluence.
Friends, through such small things we can intensify a strong fight against malnutrition in our country.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both the poor and the self-sufficient have suffered from malnutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutrition movement across the country.
You must associate yourselves with this, get information and get new ideas in it.
If you have brought one or two persons out of the malnutritional deficiency then we can bring the country out of the malnutritional deficiency.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of confidence that some questions would be asked about this thing.
And in the last few weeks, wherever I went, whenever I met the people, there was talk of Man Vs Wild.
I have never imagined that I would get such an opportunity to be amongst the young minds of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
Whenever I get the opportunity to visit as the Prime Minister, whenever I get the opportunity to visit, whenever the situation has become due to International Day of Yoga, whoever visits the world or wherever he visits, he starts asking me about Yoga for 5-6 minutes.
Till now, I have not only been the leader of the world of debate on Yoga, but this has been my experience throughout the world.
But nowadays there is a new experience.
Whenever I meet someone, whenever I get the opportunity to meet them, they talk about the issues related to wildlife and discuss about the environment.
165 countries have been telecasting this programme in their language.
But one more interesting thing, some people are asking me a thing with difficulty. Modi ji, you are speaking in Hindi, when Bear Grylls doesn't know Hindi, how was it possible to talk so fast among you
Has this been subsequently composed
Look, there's no secret.
The reality is that the technology used extensively to negotiate with Bear Grylls.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing Jim Corbett National Park with me.
You must also visit places associated with natural and wildlife.
I have said it earlier and I reiterate that you must visit the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is huge.
Your thoughts will be enlarged.
I have had the privilege of releasing the census of the barbs in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The number of tigers in India is 2967.
A few years ago, half of them were their numbers.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010.
Concerns were expressed about the declining number of tigers in the world and in the end the resolution was made.
This commitment is to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, because of which we are achieving the goals at a fast pace, we have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019 itself.
India has not only increased the number of tigers but also the number of protected areas and social security forces.
When I published tiger related data, I was reminded of the lions in the Gir forests of Gujarat.
I was the chief minister there when the habitat of lions was decreasing in the jungles.
Their numbers were also declining.
We took steps one after another in the forests of Gir.
In 2007, we decided to place women in charge.
We have made structural developments to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about natural and wildlife, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, it is necessary to create an ecosystem for our forests, plants and wildlife to preserve our forests in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Vivekanand Ji on September 11, 1893
This young saint of India, who has raised the humanity from the world over, has left a shining mark of India in the world.
The slave India that the world saw, the same world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let us try to show how Swami Vivekananda ji saw the form of India, Swami Vivekananda ji saw the strength of India and let us strive to live it.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move forward with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 29th August as National Sports Day.
It will be yours that there will be a very interesting movement for all children, the elderly, the youth and the women.
But today I am not going to say anything about their nuances.
I would like to inspire you to create awareness about the sensitivity and we should collectively resolve some goals for a stable India and for our nation.
I am confident that all of us will engage in a full-fledged manner to get rid of cashew nuts and households and we will shout slogans on social media.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On 26th January, our Republic celebrated every corner of the country with enthusiasm and joy.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the powers and the emphasis on the democratic system, is a cultural motivation and enhances the awareness of the democratic responsibilities of the future generations.
But in our country there is still no more widespread and profound debate on the duties and rights of the citizens.
Tomorrow is 30th January, our honourable brotherhood Day.
We will observe a two minute silence on 30th January at 11 a.m. and pay our homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
As a society and as a nation, our obligation to pay a two minute silence on January 30 at 11 a.m.
It is not only a matter of two minutes but it has a social character and a sense of dedication and an expression of our concern for the martyrs.
We have expressed our natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I convey my best wishes to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honoured with various medals for the gallantry personnel who have been conferred on this Presidents Day.
The medals include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I particularly urge the youth to do one thing that you are working hard on social welfare.
Write about all the soldiers who have been honoured this time on the website and share them with your friends.
When we know deeply about the adventure, valour and valour of those soldiers, we will get united with wonder, pride and enthusiasm.
While we experienced great enthusiasm and joy in the news of January 26, on the other hand, some of our soldiers who are engaged in the security of our country in Kutch have died due to snowstorms.
I salute and pay my respects to all those who have laid down their lives.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously chanting Mann Ki Baat.
The four months of January, February, March and April are challenging months for every family.
Though there is a choice for a child at home, the entire family is crying on the burden of examinations.
I have always felt the need to come out of this situation, so today I would like to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such a situation happy.
While the creator has asked this question, I know that this question is in the hearts of all of you.
Exams should be an occasion full of happiness.
For most people, exams are a period of stress.
You must decide whether you think this is a time of joy or not, whether you feel the time of pressure.
Everyone who is considered to be a stressful period, is regretted - pleasure or pressure.
Therefore, I am of the view that you should take the time of examination as a festival and a festival.
Whenever there is a festival or celebration, it shows the speciality of ourselves.
The entire family should work as a team and contribute enthusiastically to the success of this celebration.
There will be a change in the time you keep looking.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there is only one exam in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to revamp these three-four months celebrations in accordance with our family environment by bearing their traditions in their own way.
If you say you were glad, if you were on your face with joy, you would feel loyal and so many years old things would be easily reflected in your thoughts.
You will clearly see what the teacher had said in the classroom a year ago.
Thinking power will stagnate and it will become a burden.
We cannot imagine how many very useful things will suddenly come to mind if the depression is forgotten, if we are faithful.
Its not that you dont have any information or you dont work hard.
But whenever there is pressure, your knowledge and your knowledge will sink and your pressure will sweep on you.
Therefore, I would like to say that a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet, a happy mind is the key to high marks.
Sometimes I am being told that we do not approach the examinations in the right perspective.
This is not the text of your life.
This is not the choice of how you lived your life, how you lived your life and how you lived your life.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of inspiring us.
He went to the Air Force and was defeated.
Marks have become more important.
As a result, there has been an increase in potato race and a lot of pressure has been exerted in the minds of the students.
In such a scenario, I would like to share your views on the modern course of education and its future.
And if you believe in these things then the marks will be suppressed like the tail of wind.
Until yesterday, it is necessary to know the condition of my knowledge and where I have reached today.
If we talk about the world of sports then it will be remembered immediately, so I have taken this example.
Most of the sportspersons take part in their lives because they compete with themselves.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar
He has been defeating many achievements for 20 years and he has made a new achievement every time he made his own achievement.
His journey of life is wonderful because he has been following the path of challenges himself, leaving competition with others.
Friends, in every sphere of life, you will have to take the exams so that you can study for 2 hours while studying for 3 hours
You might have decided to wake up early in the morning and it might have been delayed, but can you get up at a fixed time
Therefore, I urge you people to compete with others and create challenges for yourself.
It should be very careful about how my work was done earlier, how I can move forward and how I can do it better.
From this point of view, if you approach, you will be able to make a difference in yourself.
S.
Sundar ji, you're absolutely right to say.
You might have noticed that even today those who ask me questions, those who give me advice, they have an extra number of women.
Because when we look at how much mothers are aware about the future of the children in their homes and are working constructively then it is known that they make things easier.
Keep yourself guided by your capabilities and take time out of your work.
Once you have become accustomed to accepting, most of your problems will be solved.
The expectations of parents and teachers are rooted in their problems.
Acceptance of what exists only indicates the way for a solution to the problems.
Expectations make the path even more difficult.
You'll be comfortable with your load.
In a way, we are going to see the patient and we are afraid of the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that sometimes we also create this kind of fear among our children.
Have you ever felt the need to create a happy environment during the examination days
You will see that the environment changes completely.
I got a wonderful phone call.
He didn't want to mention his name.
You will know why he doesn't want to mention his name.
Honourable Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of something I did in my childhood.
Once there is a competitive habit, the thirst for learning in life will be lost.
A telephone call came, "Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I want to ask you two questions about my examinations because I am studying in class 12.
The common theme is that students focus on sports and focus on education.
This basic idea is wrong, this is the root cause of the problem.
If we call for a complete development, there is a life beyond the textbooks, which is very vast.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it is 5 minutes or not, take some rest.
You can feel your work is uncomfortable.
I don't know whether everyone likes it or not, but this is my experience.
When I address the dais during elections, sometimes my voice refuses to cooperate.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you're sleeping.
Until now I have not even thought that my sleep is linked to my speech and my voice and he has given me the basic treatment.
If we understand the significance of these basic things then we will get many benefits.
Don't do that, otherwise your family is going to get angry with me.
If you don't see your mark on the day the paper comes, I'll see them in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
It is a big deal to keep mind, intelligence and body fit.
Okay, young friends, while you are making arrangements for your examinations, I am sure that perhaps what I have said today might be a relief for you.
But I also urge you not to be burdened with what I have said.
If possible, look at it and don't do it.
Remember your resolve, rely on you, go for the election and my best wishes to you all.
Turn that challenge as a festival before facing every challenge.
Then there will be no challenge.
Keep this mantra in mind and move forward.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their commitment towards the nation.
It is a matter of pride for us that our Coast Guard, with 126 ships and 62 aircraft, is the 4th largest coast guard in the world.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is wound raksham.
Underlining their objective, the Coast Guard is awakening day and night in adverse conditions to protect the coastal areas and the coastal areas of the country.
Many may not know that the coastal guard of our country is not only men but also women are performing their duties successfully by standing shoulder to shoulder.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are pilots and observers and are operating Howrah Graph.
As the Coast Guard becomes the worlds largest, today I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the Indian Coast Guard for their 40th anniversary.
Vasantha Panchami is a great festival of Saraswati Puja in our country.
This is considered an opportunity to praise education.
Not only this, it is also a time to inspire the soldiers.
May Rang de Basanthi Chola, make me a spring agent, an inspiring idea.
On this auspicious occasion of Vasantha Panchami, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Akashwani in Mann Ki Baat has always given a new colour to new colours in accordance with his creativity.
Immediately after the completion of my Mann Ki Baat over the last two months, they are broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in regional languages.
This has received immense reception.
I have got a great opportunity to travel with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, greetings and good wishes to you all on Christmas Day.
Today, service, sacrifice and compassion should be valued in our lives.
Many wealthy people came and gave us one wealth.
Finally, a poor widowed mother came and dumped 2 coffee.
Today, on their birth anniversary, we will pay our emotional tributes.
Two days ago, I had the privilege of starting several development works in Malavia's holy land of Varanasi.
In Varanasi, I laid the foundation stone of the prestigious Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
The Cancer Centre will be set up not only in Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also in Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have also made the country proud in the field of nuclear energy.
Atal ji's exclusive contribution as a Party President and as a Member of Parliament, as a Minister or as a Prime Minister has made him an example.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I convey my deepest greetings to him and pray to God for his good health.
As an employee, I was overwhelmingly distressed to work with Atal ji.
The memories of him appear to be green in front of my mind.
Today, on the auspicious occasion of Christmas, the people of the country are getting the benefits of two schemes as gifts.
In a way, these two can be considered the beginning of new projects.
Cashless transactions, be it villages or cities or be it studies or be it mammoths or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless purchases or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions or be it cash-free transactions or be it cash-free transactions or be it cash-free transactions or be it cash-free transactions or be it cash-free transactions, we all over the country.
Everyone wants to learn the methods related to each other.
Similarly, the DigiDhan Business Programme, which is an incentive for businesses, will be available on 25th December as Christmas Prize for 15,000 individuals in a smooth manner.
The project is scheduled to start from today to 100 days.
Every day 15,000 persons will receive prize money of Rs.
Digi is mainly for businesses.
It will also provide a wonderful opportunity for the businesses to be smooth and smooth.
This scheme is designed by focusing on all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class
Those who buy goods worth 50 to 3000 rupees will get the benefit of this thing.
This is not for those who buy more than Rs. 3000.
Even the poorest of the shopkeepers can purchase goods using USSD, feature phones and simple phones, sell them, pay the money, all of them will be benefitted from this scheme.
Those living in rural areas can buy, sell and win prizes through AEPS.
Today, there are around 30 crore RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 crore cards are from poor families and Jan Dhan account holders.
These 30 crore people will be able to participate in the award immediately.
I am sure that the people of the country will take the country in this manner and will be eager to get the information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see the rapid spread of awareness about how technology is being used in the country, how it is e-payment and how it is online.
In the last few days, cashless trade has grown by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
Businessmen are well aware of how big this resolution is.
Income tax concessions have been granted to those traders who make digital payments and pay online payments instead of cash in their business.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
A committee headed by Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu has been constituted and they are reviewing several projects.
At the same time governments have also started and implemented several schemes in their own way.
I have been told that the State Government of Assam has announced that 10 tax rebate will be paid on digital payments including property tax and business licence fee.
An amount of Rs. 50,000 will be disbursed from the Government if the branches of rural banks handle at least two digital transactions with their 75 account holders from January to March.
The Committee has announced that by 31st March, 2017, 100 Digital Payments will be disbursed from Government to Digi Payments as the best Panchayat for Digi Payments.
Several organisations have been successfully carrying forward digital payments to rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that there has been an increase of 27 percent this year compared to GNFC fertilizer sales last year.
80 rupees for availability of 100 rupees and 50 rupees for availability of 80 rupees and deprived of insurance and health facilities.
But now cashless payments are being made.
Our country has a youth majority.
Technology is our handiwork.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector in comparison to all countries.
Our youth have made substantial progress through the start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital direction.
Our youth should add to this sector how much strength can be added to this sector by using new ideas, innovative technology and modern methods
At the same time, we have to associate ourselves with full force in the movement to get rid of black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I pray you before the voice of Mann, that you give your counsel, and show your opinions
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters have been concentrated on MyGov and narendramodiap, of which 80-90 percent of suggestions are related to corruption and black money elimination and currency clearance.
After seeing all these, I feel that these are generally classified in three ways.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties faced by the citizens due to this currency exemption.
In other words, they mentioned how the cowards have taken up new ways in which such a wonderful work, such an excellent work, this work done for the welfare of the nation, such a sacred work has been going on.
My countrymen, you have written so many letters to me and I am grateful to you people for this thing.
"This path is commendable for bringing black money under control.
Though it is true that all of us citizens are facing difficulties, we all are on the verge of fighting corruption and our cooperation in this war gives us happiness.
We are fighting a war against corruption and black money, as is the case with the armed forces, said Gurmani Keval in his comment on Mygov.
Gurumani Kaval ji is a peoples voice in every corner of the country.
They are the factors that make a genuine transformation, the agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to not only those who have tolerated many difficulties but also those who have retaliated hard on those who have tried to take the people in the wrong direction.
Efforts were made on a massive scale to fight the war against corruption and black money
Not only this, many people jumped into the field, used their creativity and intellect to tear off the images of those who spread rumours and illuminated the truth.
When 1. 25 billion people of my country are connected with me, can there be something that is impossible
If the blessings of the people of Mahesan were there, would it not be for Isan's blessings
I express my gratitude to the countrymen, I greet them with my salutations and people have been participating in this great festival against corruption and black money with full enthusiasm.
I had hoped that this war against corruption and black money in the Parliament will be discussed in detail for political parties and for political parties.
Had the sessions been held in the House, the discussion would have taken place.
It is absolutely wrong to say that the political parties are being exempted from all forms of exemption.
Everyone has not been able to openly support corruption and black money, they have spent their entire time and time looking for the government's grievances.
There is also a question as to why he has often changed the rules.
This government is working for the people of the Mahesars.
The government is trying to keep the public listening to the comments.
When they handle new strategies, we also have to adopt new ways to overcome their evil intentions.
In this war of Vedak Kandan and Kodakantan, an end has to be made for corruption, draconian practices and black money.
On the other hand, there have been letters from a number of people about what kind of bad practices are being handled and what new methods are being used.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen on this occasion.
In order to share such information, the Government has created an email address exclusively.
Besides, you can also send MYGov to the website.
The government has built a shoulder-breaking glass against all kinds of evils, such as the evils you point out.
When your collaboration is not over, it's easy to fight.
Third types of letters are also in huge numbers.
"Modi ji, don't be impatient, don't hesitate, do whatever you want to do, do whatever hard work you don't worry, but if you decide to travel and step on the path then you don't have to finish the decision, you can finish it and you can't finish it.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, in the midst of all these hardships, our farmer friends made stern efforts and defeated the records that were produced last year after sowing.
From the point of view of agriculture, this is a good sign.
The hard work of the worker, the farmer, the young man and the worker of this country has been renewed for the country.
A few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has enlisted its name in many fields with pride.
India's progress in the world class rankings through individual indicators is a result of the continuing efforts of our skilled nations.
Indias ranking has improved in the World Bank report on Free Trade.
India has jumped 32 places in the WEF report on global competitiveness.
We have moved up 16 places on the Global Performance Index of 2016, 19 places on the World Banks Infrastructure Services Performance Index of 2016.
Several other statements also reflect the same estimation and India is growing rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time the anger of the countrymen on the Parliamentary session was read out.
Angry over the functioning of the Parliament has emerged everywhere.
The President and the Vice President openly expressed their dissatisfaction.
But in such a scenario, when some good things are happening then the mind is happy.
Even in the midst of the Parliament, the nation did not pay any attention to the noble work done.
Brothers and sisters, I am glad and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made keeping in mind the objective of development of Divyangjans.
I express my gratitude to the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for the completion of this project and thank you on behalf of millions and millions of people with disabilities of the country.
This government is working towards the welfare of Divyangjans.
Personally, I have also tried to increase the speed of this objective to take it forward.
My aim was to ensure that the persons with disabilities get their rights and respect.
Our distinguished brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and hopes by winning four medals in the Paralympics Games.
They have not only brought glory to the country through their successes, but have also brought people into the surprising sea through their talent.
Our alternate brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, are invaluable assets and invaluable energy.
After enactment of this Act for the benefit of Persons with Disabilities, employment generation for Persons with Disabilities has increased.
The reservation limit for government services has been enhanced to 4.
The Act provides for special arrangements for education, facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been set up for Divyangjans and you can understand the government's understanding of Divyangjans since 580,000 Divyang brothers and sisters have been provided with equipment at a cost of Rs. 352 crores.
A new law has been enacted based on the feelings of the United Nations.
Earlier, the Divyangjans were classified at 7 levels, but now by enacting the law, we have made it 21, out of which 14 are further integrated.
This is for the first time that they have got justice and opportunity by integrating some types of persons with disabilities.
For example, we have combined Thalassemia, Parkinsons, those affected, and those who have narrow shapes at birth.
The Indian Cricket Team has won a 4-point victory in the match against the UK.
Some youngsters are commendable in this film.
Our country's young man, Karuna Nair, beat 3 percent.
KL Rahul scored 199 runs.
Test Captain Virat Kohli not only spoke well but also led a good leadership.
Indian cricket team of spinner ball player R.
Ashwin was named the International Cricket Committee, the Cricket of the Year for 2016 and the Best Teest Cricketer.
Many congratulations and my best wishes to all of them.
In the hockey sector, after 15 years, we have received very good news.
Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of India's Hockey Annie.
Our women virgins have performed well last month.
If the Indian women's hockey team won the Asian Championship, India's women's hockey team won the Bronze medal in the 18-year-old Asian Games.
Like every year, during Diwali, I once again went to the border areas of China, celebrating Diwali with the soldiers.
Along with ITBP, Indian Tibetan soldiers and soldiers, I celebrated Deepawali at the peaks of the Himalayas.
I'm going every time, but this Deepavali's experience is incredible.
People are connected not only with the message but also with the mind.
One produced poems, the other produced films, the other produced cartoons, the other produced video.
That is, every house is like a place where soldiers live.
When I saw letters, I was surprised to know how many imaginations and feelings are there in the minds of the people.
A soldier of the Armed Forces had written to me - "Prime Minister, for all of us soldiers, every festival like Deepavali and Holi will be on the border.
We will spend every moment in the country's defence ideas.
Yes, however, the housing concept comes in the festive days.
But if you want to tell the truth, this time it does not seem like that.
There was no thought that we were not at home on the day of this festival.
We also feel that we are celebrating Diwali along with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, during this Deepawali festival, should the feelings of admiration among the security forces of our country be lost with a few moments
As a society, as a nation, it is our nature and I appeal to all of you that this feeling should be confined to our emotions, be it a festival or a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a joyous occasion, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, the strength and strength of the forces will increase by 125 crores.
A short while ago, all the leaders from the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
They belonged to the Panchayati Raj Convention in Jammu Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages in the Kashmir Valley.
I got an opportunity to interact with them for a considerable time.
They had come to talk about some issues related to the development of their villages, some had come up with some demands, but it was natural that when the conversation began to lengthen, the environment of the valley, the law and order situation and the future of the children were different.
With a warm and open mind these leaders of the village have touched the hearts of the people.
At the same time, I was able to feel the pain that our countrymen had suffered due to the burnt schools in Kashmir, similarly the same was felt by the leaders of the village.
They believed that the schools were not burned, and the future of the children was burned.
When you return to your villages, I pray that you pay attention to the future of these children.
I am glad that all the leaders from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise made to me very well.
They went to the villages and spread awareness among the remotest people.
A few days ago, during the Board examinations, 95 per cent of the children of Kashmir participated in the Board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of student students in board exams indicates that our children in Jammu Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
While conveying my best wishes to those students for their motivation, I extend my heartfelt greetings to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the village leaders.
Dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, everyone's suggestions came about one thing.
Everyone has asked me to speak in detail about the notes of 500-1000 rupees.
In my address to the people of the country on the 8th of November at 8pm, I talked about the beginning of a transformational gathering in the country.
Whenever I had made this resolution before you, I had publicly said that the decision was not simple, it was difficult.
But the more important the resolution is, the more important it is to be implemented.
I am sure, in our average life, we will have to face many difficulties of innovation.
Even then, I had said that it would take 50 days for us to come back from the impact of this decision and only then can we take our steps towards the nature.
It cannot be easy to get rid of all the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can clearly understand the difficulties you face.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a large country, such a large number of notes, millions and millions of crores of notes, such a resolution - the whole world is looking after you, every economist is very much absorbing and evaluating it.
India has immense faith in the 125 crore people of India and the 125 crore people of the country are determined to achieve their goal of dedication.
All sections of the Central Government, State Governments, regional local bodies, 1,30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over 1. 5 lakh post offices and over 1. 5 lakh bank agents participated in the work day and night with a sense of dedication.
Despite a variety of tensions, all of them were very quiet and engaged in this effort to see the work of the country as a sweetheart and an effort to bring about a massive change.
As a result, it is obvious that India will succeed in this task.
I can clearly see that despite all these difficulties, everyone works in banks and post offices.
When it comes to humanity, they are travelling a little more.
One told me that an old man had been killed in Kandawa.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad to know that when this thing was taken to the notice of the bank employees there, he himself went to the old man's house to collect money and did not face any hurdles in treatment.
A number of such incidents take place every day on TV, in the media, in newspapers and in conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who have worked in this great village and those who have contributed to it.
But if evil is so widespread, even today evil practices have become a habit from some people.
Even now, they are thinking that this corruption money, this black money, this money that has not been accounted for, the benami money can be traced and saved.
They are trying to save their money by fainting the poor people, by uttering words or by fainting them and putting money into their accounts and buying a job from them.
Today, I would like to tell such people that the law will take care of what you want, what you want to do, what you want to do, whether you want to change or not, whether you want to respect the law or not.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor falls in the records then when I check, my beloved poor people do not do anything to the problem due to your sins.
A very stringent legislation has been enacted regarding Benami Property, which is going to come into force, which will cause a lot of difficulties.
The government wants that there should not be any hardship for our countrymen.
I live in Tirali village of Tirli, in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to the black money holders and corrupt people through notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
If this step has not been taken then every citizen of India will never have a good time.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this thing.
Encouragement is being encouraged to work on certain issues through the media, by the people and by the government.
It gives me immense joy and pride to know that the common man of my country has a wonderful potential.
It has been written that if you have an old note, if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go away with hunger, leave your food and whenever you have to travel on this path then you must pay the money.
People go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they travel again then they pay back their money.
This is the strength of my country, the spirit of service and the spirit of sacrifice.
During the election, I was talking about tea, and this message spread throughout the world.
Many countries of the world have also begun to say that Tea is a talk.
But I didn't know that weddings would take place during this tea interaction.
A marriage took place in Surat on November 17 with a tea talk.
In Surat, Gujarat, a woman used to drink only tea to her family members, didn't attend any other festivals, didn't make any feasts, because there was a shortage of money due to currency education.
The demonstrators also regarded this as a honour.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar - they have made their contribution to the massive war against corruption and black money through their marriages, this is a matter of great satisfaction.
While offering many blessings to Navparineet Bharat and Daksha, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you for making the wedding ceremony a grand bride and making it a new opportunity.
When such complications come, people set the solutions very well.
Some people have received immediate benefits from this movement.
The country will be benefited in the days to come, but the profits of some are instantly reaped.
When I heard about the incident, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, due to this resolution of 8th, everyone ran away to pay their old notes.
3,000-3500 crore was collected during the corresponding period of last year in 47 cities.
Where is 3000-3500 crores, where is 13,000 crores
Is it not natural for these municipalities to set up sewerage systems or water supply systems organisations organisations to set up Anganwadi Centres
There are many such examples of direct benefits that are visible.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strongest pillars of our economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change of economy, every citizen has been adjusting himself in the midst of difficulties.
But I would like to offer my best wishes to the farmers of my country today.
This is the reason why I was talking about the sowing data of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I have a calculation till 20th November, sowing has increased in comparison to the same period last year.
In the midst of difficulties, farmers have found a way.
The government too has taken several important decisions, in which emphasis has been given to the farmers and the villages.
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives were taken to lend them loans.
Millions of crores of rupees were given to the common man under the Mudra Yojana because crores of people are engaged in these small industries and they are providing the speed of doing business worth millions and crores of rupees.
Today, I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that you should use this as an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also upgrade the bank's app through your mobile phone.
Your contribution can be enormous in creating a non-cash society and you can utilize the entire banking activity through mobile phones to enhance your business.
There are technical channels, which are safe and quick.
I just want you to assist me in the success of this movement and I am confident that you will have to lead the transformation and you will be able to lead such a leadership.
I am confident that you will be able to leverage this technology to the business of the entire village.
I would like to tell my toiling brothers and sisters that you have suffered more injustice.
One condition is that the wages on paper are different from the money you pay in your hands.
You will have to pay your wages in full and no one will have to give a share.
You shouldn't be brutalized.
If money is deposited in your bank accounts then you can also buy goods through a small mobile phone so that money can be deposited in your shops and it does not require any smart phone and now your mobile phone also works as an e-wallet.
Therefore my hardworking brothers and sisters, I specially request your contribution in this scheme because I have made such a big decision so that the poor, the farmers, the workers, the oppressed and the deprived sections of the society get benefits.
Today I particularly want to talk to the youth.
In India, 65 per cent are below the age of 35 years.
I know that you have contributed a lot to take this forward in constructive ways.
Guys, you are my real soldiers, and you are my true comrades.
There is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to serve Mother India, this is a golden opportunity for us to take the country towards economic heights.
My young friends, can you help me
You will be well aware of the App, which means the App, the online banking system, and the booking of tickets through computers.
These things are very simple for you and you are also using them.
But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of a cashless society.
It is correct that it is not possible to have a hundred percent cashless society.
But why should we not start making India a less cash usage society
Once you have started this low-cash consumption society, the goal of a cashless society will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never disappoint me because all of us have the desire to change the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities have been created today to create a cashless society, to introduce digital bank services or to introduce mobile banking services.
Every bank provides online facility.
The straightforward meaning of the vault is e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have a RuPay card, the RuPay card which has been used very rarely after the 8th, it has increased by 300.
Banks also get prepaid cards to spend on money like prepaid cards on mobile phones.
The UPI is a nice place to do business, whereby you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This task is as simple as you send information to Wattsup.
He knew how to send information to Wattsup and how to forward it to anyone without any education.
Not only this, technology is very simple to ensure that all the smart phones are available for this work.
Money can also be exchanged through a phone with ordinary facilities.
Whoever is a waste worker, vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller, coffee seller, it can be used without any difficulty.
I have put pressure on efforts to make this process more easier.
All banks are engaged and are doing it.
Now we have abolished extra fees for online business and we have brought an end to all such taxes related to cards to strengthen the concept of a cashless society.
My young friends, despite all this, the entire generation is familiar with it.
I know that all of you are positively engaged in this great task.
I have been taking care of all the creative stories, slogans, poems, pieces, cartoons, new imagination and comedy of WhatsApp.
In the midst of challenges and in view of the creativity of our younger generations, I can see a fundamental creativity within you when we meet the times of such a massive transformation, like this that the Gita was born once in the battlefield.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that you and millions of youth of this country will do this thing.
Today, since you people have made a solemn pledge that you will be part of a cashless society.
Upgrade all the technologies for online expenditure on your mobile phones.
You should lead the untransferable society, the network of notes, the movement to free the country from corruption, the movement to liberate the country from black money and the movement to liberate the people from troubles.
Once you have taught the people about the benefits of Rupay card, the poor will bless you.
Within a month, we can stand up as a new India and you can do this thing through your mobile phones.
Go to 10 houses daily and connect 10 houses daily.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will become the heroes of this transformation and we will make changes.
We will move forward in this fight to liberate the nation from black money and corruption.
This country has created a great revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again appeal to you people, please take this movement forward.
I invite all of you, every school, college, university, National Cadet Corps and National Cadet Corps (NCC) to take up this task on a social and personal level.
We will take this task forward.
There is an opportunity for all of us to serve the nation in such a way that we should not let this opportunity be wasted.
My dear brothers and sisters, today is the birth anniversary of one of the greatest poets of the country, the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai Ji and today Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan for cleanliness.
You might have noticed that the most fascinating artist of this century, Amitabh ji, is taking the cleanliness drive forward with great vigour.
Harivansh Rai Ji has identified himself through this line.
I salute Harivansh Rai Ji and pay my respects to him.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh ji for joining Mann Ki Baat and guiding the cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your emotions and your letters continuously connect me with you people, with mygov and narendramodiap.
Mann Ki Baat is now broadcast at 11 p.m. but it will start soon after it is completed in regional languages.
Thank you very much to you all.
Deepavali is being celebrated everywhere in India with enthusiasm and consolidation.
India is a country that is celebrating 365 days in some corner of the country.
But in all these things, one thing that we can see clearly, the entire journey of India's festivals, their spread, their depth, and their acceptability to the people - all these are linked to the mantra - to lead to an individual society.
Festivals show responsibility on trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Nowadays we celebrate holidays on Sundays but you must have noticed that the earlier generations, the working class, the fishermen, they had celebrated their holidays on the days of Paurnami Amavas.
The scientific evidence of what kind of changes are being brought about in the waters of Paurnami and Amavasya days and what kind of impact is there on nature.
It also has an impact on the human mind.
That is, in our country, we have a tradition of celebrating holidays in combination with magnificence and science.
Today, as we celebrate the festival of Deepavali, as I have said earlier, every pandit of ours is educating and enlightening.
This Deepavali festival also tells us that Damaso Ma Jyotirgamya has to move from darkness to light.
It does not mean the darkness caused by lack of light.
The darkness of superstition, the darkness of education, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evils.
If we are able to liberate from the darkness of the individual and the darkness of the individual who is bitter in society by lighting Deepavali, this can be the aim of spreading the light of Deepavali.
You can clearly see that every corner of India, be it the wealthy house or be it the slum of the poorest of the poor, be it the slum of the poor or be it the cleanliness drive in every family during Diwali.
Cleanliness is seen in every corner of the house.
He will keep his soil burning pure, but Deepavali has arrived.
On the occasion of Deepavali, Canada's Prime Minister is sharing his film with Twitter.
Prime Minister of UK, on Diwali in London, organised a reception to integrate all societies.
It can also be said that there is no UK city that does not celebrate Diwali with great celebrations.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film with the world with great pride.
Well, what do you know about that film
The film is a very widespread picture of 16 women members of Singapore Parliament wearing Indian saris and standing at the gates of Parliament.
All these were done on the occasion of Diwali.
I would like to say that Deepawali is a bright day and it is a great day to motivate all the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
News of accidents, fires and premature deaths in Deepavali days are of concern.
There is another problem - when doctors go to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers on the occasion of Deepavali, there is another dilemma associated with it.
The specific appeal I make to parents and guardians in particular is that when children burn firecrackers, elders should be with them, they should be careful and careful not to bear any wrongdoing.
Deepavali Festival is celebrated in our country for more days.
It's not a day's thing
This can be said as Govardham Puja, Bhai Dhuj and Lap Panchami, which is a long and long period of time till the illuminating festival of Karthika Purnami.
Besides, we are also celebrating the festival of Deepavali and we are also engaged in preparing for the Chat Pooja.
Sath-Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
In a way, it is a big festival, celebrated for 4 days, but it has a special feature - it gives a great message to the society.
It is difficult for us to calculate the gifts of the Sun God directly or indirectly.
This sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers and the security forces has emotionally impressed me.
I would like to share one thing from the world of these feelings - this Deepavali will be dedicated to the security forces.
I called upon the countrymen to participate in a movement called Sandesh2Soldiers, a message to the soldiers.
I would like to bow down to the immense affection and pride in the armed forces and there is no citizen who does not have any pride in the security forces.
The media has also turned this Deepa Utsav into a day of thanks to the soldiers.
When we are in a festive mood and if we think about them then a new energy will be created for those memories.
Even a news provides multiple power and the country has demonstrated it.
Some made paintings, cast lots, made cartoons.
I can imagine how proud these moments are for the soldiers of my country.
All these things have been identified in Hashtag, Sandesh2soldiers.
I would like to read the poem sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan.
Ashwini ji writes: I am celebrating the festival, I am glad, I am smiling, I am celebrating the festival, I am glad, I am smiling, all these are due to you, today I say this thing.
I also extend my warm greetings and good wishes to you all, the citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani has telephoned me when the soldiers are full of soldiers at the birth place and the soldiers are full of soldiers at the entrance house.
Let's hear what the family members want to say.
PM said, "Sir, I am Shivani Mohan.
Military officers and soldiers as well as their families and their wives make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, even the entire military community has received a very good message.
My dear countrymen, the brave soldier is seen not only at the border but at every stage of his life.
You may have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of open defecation.
Vikas Taroor, a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Our soldiers from the Indian Border Armed Forces went to their village on holidays.
He visited the village Panchayat at a time when discussions were going on about constructing toilets in the Gram Panchayat.
Some families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of funds.
He immediately took his cheque book and handed over the cheque of Rs. 57,000 to the President of Panchayati Raj and said that if there are no toilets in 57 houses then from my side give it to every family, construct 57 toilets and make the village Open Defecation Free (ODF).
Vikas Thakur ji has shown that he has provided Rs. 1000 per family to 57 families and has added a new energy to the cleanliness drive.
This is the reason why Himachal Pradesh is free from open defecation habits.
Similarly, it has happened in Kerala and I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this.
Immediately, the shields of the National Cadet Corps, the patriotic workers and engineering students came to the conclusion that toilets should be constructed in collaboration with them.
The students carried the whole day on their shoulders and went to the jungle with all the materials required for the construction of toilets like bricks and cement.
They constructed toilets in the village through their hard work and these youngsters freed themselves from the habit of defecating in the open in the open in the remotest jungle.
In such a scenario, Kerala is becoming an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has also declared more than 150 out of open defecation habits in all municipalities and metropolitan cities.
10 districts have been declared free from this practice.
But generally these things are not taken into consideration.
The old project and the new project will be implemented and the next project will be expected and the same will be done.
Those households where there is a gas stove, those households which have electricity, they dont need kerosene.
However, whoever is worried about the government, whoever is provided with kerosene, who is provided with fuel, who is getting electricity, the middle class is getting the opportunity to make money.
Look at a major change in the way the sale of black markets will be prevented, it will benefit the environment, our foreign exchange will be saved and peoples convenience will also increase.
Yes, there is no doubt that middle class and non-currencies will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to all of us.
It is his claim that where the country should go, how to travel, in every case it determines the standard.
The need of the hour is to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps to free them from difficulties and to do so.
Whatever our old thinking, we have to make society free from the distinction of male and female.
Now there are toilets for girl children in schools and children too.
It is a good time to achieve our daughters and daughters in a separate India.
Even though vaccination is being given by the government, lakhs of children have to go out of vaccination and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush, a vaccination drive for children who are free from vaccination, gives children the power to get rid of serious diseases.
We live in the 21st century, but there is a darkness in the village and a massive movement to electrify the village is progressing successfully.
Even after so many years of independence, when a poor mother cooks food on fire and smokes 400 cigarettes in her body, how will she be healthy
Efforts are being made to liberate 5 crore families from smoke and we are on the path of success.
Small traders, small entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, hair sellers and merchants buy interest loans from merchants.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana are the successful movements that have started to get rid of interest lenders.
Direct transfer of funds through Aadhaar to the banks and directly to the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the brokers in the lives of the common man.
We fulfil our emotions with the memories of great personalities and we have to do that.
But a telephone call from Punjab, pain from there, touched my heart. "Prime Minister, salute, sir, I speak from Punjab.
Sir, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel had worked throughout his life to unite the country and he has achieved this goal, he has united everyone.
It was on that day that Smt. Indira Gandhi ji was assassinated.
We all are well aware of the kind of events that took place in the country after that.
I want to know your views on how to prevent such unfortunate events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not just for a human being.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel did the work of integrating the country.
Sardar Patel made efforts for solidarity and integrity because of his prima facie objective, he was subjected to the anger of many, but his path of solidarity was no less than a goal.
But on the birthday of Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of families of Sardars were killed after the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi.
The unleashed atrocities on the Sardars on the birth anniversary of those great men who spent their entire life in solidarity pains us on one side of history.
But even in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the greatest strength of the country.
India's strength is unity in diversity despite diverse languages, different castes, different fabrics and diversity.
Every generation has a duty and every government is responsible for finding an opportunity for unity and for promoting the principle of unity in every corner of our country.
We will also distance ourselves from separatist thoughts and divisive nature and protect the country.
Sardar ji has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it a better India.
The mantra of solidarity is the foundation of a strong India.
The journey of Sardar ji started in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we are hearing the name Amul.
Every item of Amul is well-designed in India and abroad.
But very few people are aware that the formation of the Dairy Producers Cooperative Trade Union was due to Sardar ji's vision.
We are an example of how Sardar ji had worked for the welfare of the farmers of Miller and Amul in 1942, when he was called Gera in those days and he strengthened this idea in 1942.
I offer my respectful tributes to Sardar ji.
On 31st October, wherever we may be, Sardar ji will be remembered and we will pledge for unity.
My countrymen, in this Deepavali series, Karthika Paurnami is celebrated with great fervor.
This teachings of Guru Nanak Dev ji belong to not only India but to the entire humanity and today it is a guide to the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev ji is service, devotion, good for all.
Peace, unity and harmony are the main mantras.
Every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev ji was included in the aim of liberating society from differentiation, superstition and evil practices.
May your dreams and your commitments succeed in all respects.
In the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country because of the unleashing of terrorist attacks in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
I pay my homage to all the brave and courageous soldiers.
This cowardly phenomenon has struck the entire country.
There is a lot of sorrow and anger in the pulse of the people of the country.
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers, lost their husbands.
The country is experiencing this loss.
Therefore, my countrymen, today also tell me what I have said before you, the criminals will be punished and they will not be able to escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have tremendous faith in our army.
They will overcome every manoeuvre by their might and the 125 crore people of the country will show their heroic courage in leading a peaceful and peaceful life.
We are very proud of our military.
Today specially, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir are beginning to understand the enemies of the country very well.
As they begin to understand the truth, they have begun to move away from them and to the path of peace.
It is the wish of every parents that schools and colleges should start functioning at a fast pace.
Business has also started functioning well over the past few days.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution of our problems, our path of progress and our path of development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that if we discuss peacefully and set a road map for every problem then we will be able to provide the best way to the future generations of Kashmir.
Responsibility of Defence Administration of Kashmir Citizens
The administration has to take some measures to maintain law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to follow the capabilities, strengths, laws and regulations that we have for law and order and ensure a peaceful life of the common man of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from our views present new ideas.
A young man named Sharshvardhan, who is studying in class 11, has given me a different idea.
After the Uri terrorist attack, my mind was overwhelmed with anxiety, a desire to do something, but I did not find any way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan and I am happy that you have thought constructively at such a young age.
But the anger that Harsh Vardhan drank in the hearts of the people of the country has a great respect.
This is an expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have presented a positive approach.
However, you are aware that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had taken over the country during the 1965 war. This kind of feeling was prevalent throughout the country, it was anger, it was the patriotic dream.
Every citizen had a pledge to do something in his mind.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to give the country's feelings in an excellent way.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged the common man to work for the nation.
Every citizen should understand another attempt to express patriotism in the midst of the bombings, which Lal Bahadur Shastri presented.
While Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, when the freedom struggle was intensely determined, when there was a need for a platform, he was successful in encouraging creative work in the society.
We and our army will perform our duties, those who are in charge of the administration will do their duties, we will contribute to the patriotic spirit of our people and every citizen of our country and we will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, our sportspersons who went to participate in the Para Olympic Games are a victory of human inspiration.
Varun Viswanathan ji has written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a wonderful job and you have to tell them in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only for you two but also for every citizen of the country, there has been an emotional connection between the sportspersons who participated in the Para Olympics.
Across the sports, these para-olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the humane outlook and the outlook we see the differently abled.
I will never forget the words of our sister Deepa Malik ji after winning the medal in my life.
This time, 19 sportspersons including 3 women from our country participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, when a person with disabilities plays, their physical talent and their talent in sports is greater than the mental determination and determination.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won the Gold Medal in the High Level Contest.
Mariyappan has lost his right leg at just five years of age.
Even poverty could not hinder his morale.
He is not a resident of a big city, but a middle-class family or a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he passed a life full of hardships, irrespective of physical hardships and supplemented grief and earned medals.
While they have stirred up our emotions, they have also changed the perspective of seeing Divyangjans.
Could anyone have imagined that Persons with Disabilities can break the usual Olympics record
This time it happened.
Abdul Latif Pakar from Algeria competes with disabilities who won the Gold Medal for the 1500m Olympic Games
Once again I heartily congratulate our sportspersons and assure them that in the coming days, Bharat Para Olympics will be moving in the direction of making a positive plan for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India has organised a mega camp for Divyangjans, in which several world achievements have been made.
And I met a little girl with no visual vision, Gauri Shardul, a little girl from the lengthy jungles of Nang district.
And it came to pass, when she had told me some parts of it, that I told it before the congregation, the people were astonished.
And I believe that the government of India has made a world record in the modern world.
600 Divyangjans with hearing aids were conducted within 8 hours.
This was placed in the Guinness World Records Book.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen that the creation of three world achievements by differently abled persons in one day is a matter of great pride.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on Gandhi Jayanti.
It may be recalled that I had said that cleanliness should become our nature, it should be the duty of every citizen, it should be the duty of every citizen and it should be viewed as uncleanness.
I assure you that on 2nd October, when we mark two years of our independence, there is a sense of hygiene in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Similarly, everybody has made an effort to take a step in the direction of cleanliness.
That is, the 125 crore feet of the country are also moving towards cleanliness.
If the direction is right then it has been proved that the benefits will be good.
Whether it is a common citizen, a ruler, a government office, a road, a bus or a railway station, a school or a college, a pilgrimage centre, a hospital or adults, poor people of the village, farmers and women all have contributed to cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This progress is inadequate and we still have to make progress.
This is very important
And that is why when we talk about rural India, about 2 crore 48 lakh toilets have been constructed so far, about 2 crore and 12 crore toilets have been constructed in the coming years.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will soon end open defecation free habits.
When I had visited Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat recently, the officials had told me that the date of October 2 is the end of the open defecation.
Come, people, we will take a pledge to make progress.
In particular, my younger brothers have been using technology in full swing today and I would like to present a scheme before them.
The Government of India has made a telephone number 1969 to know about the status of Swachh Bharat Mission in your city.
You should make full use of it, especially for the younger generation.
The Government of India also urges the corporate world to come forward and make your contribution.
Young professionals who want to work for cleanliness should support the profession.
We can use them as Swachh Bharat fellows and Swachh Bharat fellows across districts.
If this Clean India Campaign is confined to the governments then progress cannot be achieved, cleanliness cannot be done naturally and it cannot be fulfilled.
Wealth is also important from waste.
Therefore, along with cleanliness, we should also move from waste to fertilizer.
Fertilizers have been asked to purchase compost made from waste.
The farmers who want to engage in organic farming should be able to get this fertilizer.
This fertilizer should be provided to those who want to develop their land, who are interested in the welfare of the land and who have suffered substantial damage due to chemical fertilizers.
Amitabh Bachchan has contributed to this work as a business ambassador.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Municipal Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are all going to do intense and deeper consultations on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What could be the financial model
Debates are being held on all matters like this.
I can see that there is a constant innovation in the field of cleanliness.
I had read one day in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to spread awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has prepared a list of its Ministries for a year.
Each department should focus on cleanliness for 15 days better.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DWS), Panchayati Raj and Rural Development (DRD) will collaborate on Swachhta related projects in their respective administrative boundaries from 1st to 15th October, 2019.
During the last two weeks of October, three more Ministries - Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs - will carry out Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective administrative boundaries from 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens that if you have some linkage with these sectors then you should also join them.
You might have noticed that now the cleanliness related research drive is going on.
Initially, a survey of cleanliness was conducted in 73 cities and it was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, and now each city has a belief that we are lagging behind and the next time we have to move ahead.
There is a competitive environment related to cleanliness.
We all have to contribute so much to this movement by the citizens as we can.
Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri were born on 2nd October.
It is about two years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
On the start of Gandhi Jayanti, on the end of Deepavali, I have been asking you to buy a little bit of papers.
Once again I urge every family to buy some or the other door, so that the light burns in the houses of the poor on Diwali.
On Sunday, 2nd October, as a citizen, can we not engage in any work related to cleanliness
I urge you to involve yourselves in the cleanliness drive for 2 hours and 4 hours physically and share a photograph of it with me on the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
This movement will once again get strength and a new momentum will be created.
Recalling Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us strive to do something for the country.
The retaliations made by the people of the country in accordance with my request to evacuate the gas subsidy in the past days is a great inspiration for the country's survival.
It is a movement that collects food items and clothes for the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, all our employees took to the streets, donated old sports goods to their families and brought them to Anganwadi in the poorest of the poor.
Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay Ji explained the political thoughts inspired by which hundreds of thousands of workers like me have been working.
The centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji begins today, the political ideology associated with the roots of India, the vision to cherish the heritage of India's culture, the philosophy of a harmonious political philosophy and the philosophy of humanity.
Sarvajan Hitai, Sarvajan Sukkai, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.
Gandhiji also spoke of the well-being of the last person.
How to bring the fruits of development to the poor in the market
Deendayal put forward the overall economic project in one word for every hand, water in every land.
The country must celebrate her birth centenary as a year of welfare for the poor.
The focus of all of us should be on how to take the benefits of development to the poor.
I warmly recall the venerable Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, who was a source of immense thoughts and thoughts of our people.
The ordinary man of this country has inspired me.
What are the aspirations of the common man of this country
Mann Ki Baat has emerged as a record of the common man in my mind and in my mind.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for telecasting my views and making a concerted effort to bring it in all languages.
They summed up letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions, clapped the government doors, highlighted the government's grievances, the Akashwani prepared special programmes with such letters, brought representatives from the government and set up a platform for solving problems.
Mann Ki Baat is not confined to a 15-20 minute conversation, but a new occasion for social transformation.
What could be more joyous than this
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to this success and salute them.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadasamy will be coming next week and there is a different kind of atmosphere throughout the country where arrangements for Deepavali will begin.
This is the energy devotion and the unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri or Durga Puja, we will think of making this Shakti Dharma a path for social unity.
Keeping in mind the ideas of peace, unity and harmony to take the country towards new heights, we will observe the holy days of Navratri and Durga Puja.
Let us celebrate Vijayadasamy as a victory.
This day is being celebrated throughout the country as National Sports Day.
He did a great job of securing the gold medal for India during the Olympic Games held in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
At that time, it was just 10 minutes to get the shit out.
Dhyan Chand ji put 3 goals in those 10 minutes and I have retaliated for the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov website or narendramodiap.
They are of different kinds.
But this time there were maximum demands for me to comment on the Rio Olympics.
It is very encouraging to see such an eagerness and awareness about the Rio Olympics in the public mind and the pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it.
Even beyond cricket, Indians have so much interest in other sports, there is so much awareness and so much information.
Sachin has written, "A request to you, this time in Mann Ki Baat, talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
One of these women belongs to North India, one from South India, one from East India and the other from the corners of India.
It looks like the daughters of India have taken the responsibility of making the country proud.
On MyGov web site, Shikar Dakur ji wrote that we could have done even better in the Olympics.
He further said, Excellency Modi sir, my best wishes to you for the two medals we have won in Rio.
There is a need to travel long distances in sports competitions.
Our parents are paying attention only to studies today.
Even now, in the society, they see sports from the point of view of time.
We have to change this thinking.
There is a need to encourage society.
Who else can give this job better than you
Likewise, Shri Sathyaprakash Mehra also wrote in narendramodiap - Mann Ki Baat had called for emphasis on the need for extra-curricular activities.
In a way, the same sentiment reflected in the writings of thousands.
It is true that according to our expectations, there is no alternate opinion on the fact that we cannot function.
We have only two medals in the medals.
But if we don't get the medals, we can see that for the first time in many cases Indian sportspersons have shown considerable talent.
Our Abinav Bindra ji won the 4th position in the shooting segment and lost the medal in a very small margin.
Likewise, Sania Mirza-Rohan Bopanna in the tennis competition took place.
We have performed well in the Athletics sector this time.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar ji has qualified for the Track Field.
For the first time in 36 years, men have succeeded in achieving the knock out position in the men's hockey competition.
Vikas Krushna Yadav came to the final stages of his footsteps in boxing, but he could not win a bronze medal.
Several soldiers, for example - Aadhi Ashok, Tattu Bohnnel and Athanu Das, have performed well.
But my dear countrymen, there is a lot more we need to do.
But if we continue to act as we have done so far, perhaps we may have to be disappointed again.
I have made a report on the formation of a group.
The Government of India is deeply illuminated and will consider what kind of activities are there in the world.
Action plan will be set on what field we can do well.
Our programmes should be formulated with a vision of 2020, 2025 and 2028.
My appeal to all the Indian citizens interested in this thing is to send their suggestions on narendramodiap.
Let the State Governments send their suggestions after discussions.
My dear countrymen, September 5th is Teachers Day.
I was able to learn a lot with these little boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not only the Teachers Day but also the Education Day.
But this time when I had to attend the G20 Summit then today I felt that I can express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat itself.
The place of teacher is as important as the place of mother in life.
We have seen teachers who are more interested in us than we are.
They dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as a great teacher, beyond being a sportsperson.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his full commitment to sports, and his joy in the victory of the pilgrims.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On September 5, 2018, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnans birthday
Whatever conditions he attained in his life, he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he always says that a student in a good teacher does not die forever.
The references and citations of the books he read in that month would have been found.
What I did throughout the month was correct in his vision.
It's like he teaches me in classrooms even today.
Even today, he is imparting far-reaching education to me.
When I look at his signature at the age of 90, I wonder how many pearls can be written by him in this old age
Because my signature is so bad that if someone had written beautifully, it would have increased my respect.
Like my experience, you may have experience.
And if you say that whatever good you have received from your teachers in your life then it will change from the point of view of teachers and it will be a matter of pride.
It is our responsibility to increase the dignity of teachers in the society.
If something happens with your teacher, if something happens with your teacher, if it is a matter of encouraging your teacher, then definitely share it with narendramodiap.
It is a matter of immense pride for the students to take care of the contribution of teachers in the country.
But when we talk about the Ganesh Chaturthi then it is natural for us to return to our memories of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The tradition of socially celebrating the Ganesh Chaturthi is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak.
He transformed the religious procession into a day of national awareness and became a day of social culture.
The Ganesh Chaturthi discussed all the questions that touched the social life, thereby creating a new upsurge and a new blossom in the society.
Its not only that, the mantra that he had given - Swarajya should be the centre of our genius and the power of freedom struggle should be provided.
Not only in Maharashtra but today the Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated socially throughout the country.
They are discussing public matters, conducting columns and competing for the golam.
The scenes in this film would have artistically highlighted the touching aspects of the society.
In a way, a movement that creates awareness for all is being carried out through a socially-formed Ganesh Chaturthi.
Lokmanya Tilakaraswarajam has given us the Model of Our Generation.
But we are now in independent India.
Come on, I'll call you.
Celebrations are the forces of society.
They give a new life to the individual and the society.
Life without festivals is not possible but it needs to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that many people have written about the Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Pooja this time.
They are concerned about the environment.
Mr. Shankar Narayana Prashanth has cleverly appealed to you people to understand through Mann Ki Baat programme that you do not use the idols of Plaster of Paris.
The statues made by the Plaster of Paris are not conducive to the environment, but many others have expressed their concerns.
I appeal to all of you that we should use the statues of Pilgrims or Durgas made of earth and restore our ancient heritage.
Ganesh is the one who removes difficulties.
In such a scenario, we should not build a Ganapati statue that causes embarrassment.
I don't know how you take what I'm saying, but I'm not just saying this, many say it.
An architect of Pune, Mr. Abijit Todbale, the founding fathers of Kolhapur, Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Prabodini, Nisarkatta of Vidarpah, Gyan Prabodhini of Pune, RAA king of Mumbai.
Various types of organisations and individuals are working hard to build dusty Ganesh statues and campaigning about them.
A Great Chaturthi that does not pollute the environment is also a social service.
There is still some time for Durga Puja.
And the households that make traditional images shall get employment through such earthen images
We will take a resolution that our ponds and rivers will be protected as they do from the soil of the rivers.
It is natural for the countrymen to be proud when Mother Theresa, who served the poor of India, is going to be conferred the title Holy One.
We have got the privilege of learning something every moment with the saints, sages and great men.
We have received something from them, we are learning and understanding the good deeds.
My dear countrymen, when progress is a movement then how big a change will be brought about
People are seen as Shakti Mahesan Shakti.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with five State Governments, has made a successful effort to clean Ganga and to clean the Ganga with the people.
We invited the heads of villages living on the banks of river Ganga to a meeting in Allahabad on 20th of this month.
And of them were men, and women.
I extend my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have done this great job.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of the five State Governments for helping us collectively take a crucial step towards Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things touch my mind and sometimes I have a special respect for those who create such an opportunity.
On 15th July, over 1700 schools comprising over 1.
More than 25 lakh students wrote letters to their parents socially.
Some had written to their parents in English, some in Hindi and some in Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their homes.
They had demanded that they should construct a toilet, some children would not mind if you don't celebrate my birthday this year, but they had written so much that you should construct a toilet.
This work was done by children between the ages of seven to 17 years.
There is a 16-year-old Mallamma in Kopal district of Karnataka, who has made a satyagraham against her family.
He did not do anything to achieve himself or to dress up and eat sweets.
Beti Bachao, Mallamma's stubbornness is just because we want a toilet in our house.
Look at the specialty of the village leader Mohammad Shafi, he made an arrangement of 18,000 rupees and within a week he had constructed a toilet.
But everybody is associated with it in some way or the other, everybody is playing a golden role.
I also invite television channels to make such short films and organize competitions.
There is no need for a big studio and a big camera to make a film.
In today's time, you can produce a film using the camera on your mobile phone.
Our respected President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new event called Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Several people may have a question of introducing a radio channel as the President of the country.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal have a shared cultural heritage.
Here Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Pedar Radio will exchange events across the borders and people speaking Bengali on both sides will be happy to hear audiences.
Akashwani's great contribution is to connect people with people.
The President has inaugurated it.
I also express my gratitude to our partner Bangladesh for completing this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani for their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, all of you may have made me the Prime Minister of the country but I am a man like you.
So sometimes my mind is touched by some emotional events.
Such emotional events provide a new energy and a new concept, which inspires the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter to me just a few days ago touched my heart.
It was written by a mother about 84 years old
If a retired teacher hadn't asked for his name, I would have mentioned his name.
As you asked me to expel the subsidy for gas, I also quit the subsidy and forgot about it.
As far as I am concerned, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is similar to the Padma Shri Award.
Ladies and Gentlemen, you know that I have tried to send a letter from my side to all those who have evacuated the gas subsidy and some representative of myself will go and give it to those who have evacuated the subsidy.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, last year we had to suffer due to drought, but this August has caused a series of floods.
There have been frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the local bodies, the welfare organizations and the citizens have made efforts to make their homes.
However, some of the actions that have taken place amidst these tragic floods are worth remembering.
It will remind us in August this year that what will be the outcome of a united life when all shoulder-to-shoulder movement.
In August 2016, the opposition parties, 90 parties across the country and all the political parties in the Parliament, joined hands in enacting the Goods and Services Tax Act.
Congratulations to all the political parties for this achievement.
This is an excellent example of what would be the benefit of all political parties traveling together in one direction.
Similarly, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country, in one voice, discussed the issue of Kashmir.
It was conveyed to the world and to the separatist forces and to the people of Kashmir their understanding.
After talking to all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing came to light and if I wanted to suppress it in two words then it was solidarity and love.
These two words mixed with their root mantra.
We all believe that whatever deaths occur in Kashmir, whether it is the life of a young man or the life of a soldier of security forces, the loss is ours, it is the confidence of our country, the confidence of 1. 25 billion Indians, the confidence of the leader of the village and the Prime Minister of the country.
Those who promote small boys to create unrest in Kashmir, that is, one day they should be answered to these irresistible children.
I have faith in the 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning, I had the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi and I hope that in the coming days, the spirit of sports throughout the country will increase the enthusiasm and zeal of every youngster.
We all know that within a few days the biggest Kumbh of World Games is going to be held.
The word Riyo is always in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Indian government had arranged for Run for Rio to play, live, play and grow.
In the coming days, whatever area we may be, we will be engaged in something that will inspire our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this thing from your side.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to take your blessings to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all do whatever we can to inspire and inspire every sportsperson in the coming days
Today, while talking about Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet of Punjab Central University.
Like him, many other poets may have written poems in this context, some may have made them melodious songs, but today I want to share with you the poetry written by Suraj ji in every language.
And the gold and the silver, and the brass of brass, shall give the medal to the brass.
I dedicate your emotions to all these sportspersons and I convey my best wishes to you all for flying honourably from my side, from my side and from my 125 crore countrymen to Rio.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalam ji's name is being renamed, then a future picture of a skilled India in the form of science, technology and missile is visible in our eyes
In that way, your government has been making efforts to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam ji.
Moreover, if we want to make our walk musical, research and innovation must be done, this is the life of technology.
If research and innovation are not invented then how stinking can start in stagnant water, similarly technology will become a burden for us.
If we rely on old technologies without research and innovation, then in the changing era, we will become extinct
Therefore, the government has been making several efforts to sow the milk country of science, technology and the attraction of research in the minds of our youth.
Therefore, I say that let us aim to innovate and aim to innovate.
This means Atal Innovation Mission, when I say that AIM.
If we want to create next generation innovators, we should link our children with this scheme
That is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
In every school where such Mercury centres are being set up, Rs 10 lakh has been disbursed and another Rs 10 lakh will be given for maintenance in five years.
Similarly, incubation centre is directly linked to innovation.
If we have a powerful and incubation centre, we have the necessary mechanism to create innovations, to conduct tests for start-ups and to stabilize them.
While it is necessary to set up a new Centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
In our daily lives, our eyes are facing problems.
Now we have to find technical solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the younger generation of the country to come forward to provide solutions to the problems faced by your eyes, to take up research and innovation.
The Government of India wishes to give a special prize to the technology discovered to address our concerns.
When we talk about tinkering labs, it gives me great pleasure that more than 13,000 schools have applied and more than 4000 organisations without education and education have come forward to set up such centres.
I firmly believe that the real tribute that Abdul Kalam can pay to him is to undertake research, innovation, technological solutions to the problems that we face in our daily lives, and to make our lives easier to get rid of our difficulties.
The way our younger generation pays attention to these things, their contribution in building a New India of the 21st century will be so great that this will be a real tribute to the memories of Abdul Kalam.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we had been worried about famine in our minds and now it is giving us joy of rain while news about floods is also coming.
The State Governments and the Centre are working shoulder-to-shoulder efforts to help the flood victims.
Even if there are some difficulties due to rain, every person feels prosperous beyond all these things because it rains at the centre of all our economic activity and agriculture.
Sometimes diseases that afflict us throughout our lives affect us.
But if we wake up, if we move forward then the ways to avoid them are easy.
Let's take the dengue fever.
We can protect ourselves from dengue fever.
Even though the government, hospitals and doctors are doing their jobs, I appeal to all of you that we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our areas and in our families, to be aware that there is no water-related disease.
My dear countrymen, I would like to turn your attention towards one more problem.
If life becomes so urgent and fast then sometimes it leaves us unnecessarily to think about us.
You can get relief for a few hours, but you must stop the habit of taking antibiotics without the advice of the doctor.
If the doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotic pills within 5 days, please complete the recommendation in the number of days as advised by the doctor.
If we leave it halfway that it is no longer necessary because it is healthy, it benefits micro-organisms and becomes stronger.
This is called antibiotic resistance in medical terms, hence it is important to follow the methods of taking them as important as the antibiotics and how they should be used.
The government is committed to preventing antibiotic reservation
You might have noticed that nowadays, the antibiotic pearls that are sold on the plate have a red coloured plate. This is to create awareness.
When we talk about health, I would like to add one more thing to it.
Pregnant mothers in our country are sometimes very worried about health.
Every year about 3 crore women conceive in our country but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Whatever the fact that the decline in the maternal mortality rate in the last decade is true, even today we are unable to save the lives of pregnant mothers more.
Unknowingly, abortions, pregnancy related infections, high blood pressure etc.
Keeping all this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Yojana.
My medical brothers and sisters cant dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year for the poor
Many people have written to me in the past days.
I am confident that you will certainly engage in this thing.
My dear countrymen, today the concerns of climate change, global warming and environment are on the rise all over the world.
Discussions are going on between the people of the country and around the world.
India has been consolidating this idea for centuries.
Lord Krishna says in Geetha: Sarvavarukshana, that is, among the trees, I am a royal tree.
There is no plant that has no medicinal value, i.e. no medicinal quality, ethnicity.
The example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention, which showed my heart.
On the observation hill of Mahabharata, it is said that trees also perform the duties of Macatchella in heaven, and Sonal has accepted the challenge of fulfilling the wishes of his parents and the entire society as a whole.
Khandu Marudi Mahadre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Several such efforts are being made.
During my tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I have seen the huge number of pilgrims visiting the Amba Devi Temple in the month of Bhadra.
Once a social service organisation provides a sapling for those who come to the temple and if they bring it and plant it in your village then mother mother will continue to shower her blessings to you.
Millions of trees were planted that year to millions of pedestrians who came.
Even the temples can start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement related to tree plantation.
I once again urge my farmer brothers that why should not we grow tea trees instead of wasting our land by constructing tree-fired fences at the borders of our farmlands
Today, in India, we have to import a single tree from abroad for building houses, chairs etc.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
Even there, a huge forest festival has been celebrated and a resolution has been made to plant 25 lakh trees.
It is not a small thing to plant 25 million trees in Rajasthan.
Only those who know about the land of Rajasthan know how big a challenge it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, it has been decided to increase green cover by 50 by 2029.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
This year, several projects like Mamar Forest, Ekta Forest and Shaheed Forest have been set up in Gujarat, out of which several crore trees have been planted.
Multilateral agreements are undertaken in various fields such as diplomatic diplomacy, non-proliferation organ, trade discussions, defence related discussions etc.
But for me, the journey to South Africa is in a way similar to a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is natural for memories of Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela to come to mind.
When the words of Ahimsa, love and forgiveness in the world come to our ears, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will be visible to us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoenix residence, where Gandhiji's residence was known as Sarvodaya.
I was fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel to Petersburg railway station where Gandhiji travelled by train and whenever he had sown the sowing of Mohantas as Gandhiji then I got the opportunity to visit that Petersburg railway station.
This time I got the opportunity to meet many great men who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years in prisons.
In a way, they sacrificed their entire youth, and I had great pleasure in visualizing great men like Ahmad Katada ji, Lalu (CHEEBA) iba ji, George Besos and Ronnie Casrales, close to Nelson Mandela.
While I was talking to them, when they were asking for their prison experiences, there was no bitterness in their minds, no mischief.
The feeling of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas is the way forward for a bright future for us.
Come, let us be proud of these Indians who have lived in the mantras of our lives even in South Africa.
I recently read in a news article that a woman stuck in a fraudulent and fraudulent email net lost 11 lakh rupees and finally committed suicide.
I am deeply saddened by the condition of a woman and her family.
I would like to know about your views on such fraudulent emails.
A new strategy using technology is spreading all over the world.
The way technology plays a major role in the economic system, its misuse is also increasing.
It was stated that at the time of retiring and having a daughter to get married, one day shortfall came to a person living on his own, and you have received a huge reward from a foreign country, to get 2 lakh rupees in a bank account for the customs settlement.
Your credit card number and debit card number are obtained and your bank account is cleaned with the help of technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should protect ourselves from this obsession and I would like to be awake. If such letters come, then we should immediately share them with our knowledgeable friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, while the session of Parliament is going on, I have got the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
I had a comfortable experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Aligarh met me.
The student was enthusiasticly running shorebounds, bringing a huge album and cheering on their faces.
They brought films that have beautified the Aligarh railway station with them.
They constructed a layer of plastic bottles at the railway station and gave a new look to the station.
If you also have the opportunity to go to Aligarh then you must visit the railway station.
This kind of information related to several railway stations in India is now coming to me and the people of that area are beautified by their regional arts on the walls of the railway stations.
It feels a new feeling.
This is an example of how change can be brought about through peoples participation.
My congratulations to all those associated with this kind of work in the country and specially to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country during the rainy season.
You will also participate in festivals in your homes and publications.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Like last year, during Raksha Bandhan, can you not give a prize to the mothers and sisters of the country the Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana or JeevanJyotiBimaYojana
Brothers and sisters, in life, give us a prize that can really feel safe.
Why, in our homes, we used to hir a woman or a daughter of a poor mother to cook food or household chores.
Can they not be given a prize under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana during the festival of Rakshabandhan
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after independence.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom Day is not a programme of governments, it should be for the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we must celebrate this day as our festival.
I would like that we should do something positive with the idea of patriotism.
You can tell the people of the country that I invite you to make it clear from the Red Fort.
It is not my wish that the ideas from the Red Fort should be made by the Prime Minister.
The emotions from the Red Fort should be the emotions of 125 crore people.
Several programs are planned on vacation days.
Awareness has spread in many villages
Someone told me just a few days ago that Hivera Bajar Gram Panchayat of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers of that area had emotionally approached the water problem.
There may be many villages that want to save water, but they have changed the entire cropping pattern after interacting with the farmers.
They decided that the crops which are used in excess of water, whether it is black or barley, should not produce such crops.
Whatever is simple to hear, but this is not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers and they left immediately because sugarcane needs too much water.
Throughout the country, they cultivated fruits and vegetables, i. e.
They have succeeded in their own efforts to tackle the problem of water today through various initiatives like spraying, drip irrigation, rain water conservation, water recharging etc.
Well, I have talked about a small village, Hivre Bajar, but there may be several such villages.
I convey my best wishes to those villagers and to all of you for the excellent work you have achieved.
Someone told me about GORVA Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Ladur through trains then I think it will become a news for the world.
The human nature is to feel that if a good news comes from some place or the other, the entire embarrassment is lost.
I have heard about the possibility of rainfall ranging from 106 percent to 110 percent this time, and it is a matter of great pleasure.
Even though it is still raining, news of good rainfall has added freshness.
However, my dear countrymen, it provides the same opportunity and challenges as the message of good rainfall.
Can we not start a campaign to save every village water even now
Farmers need soil and this is helping them in the fields.
Why shouldn't we place the soil in the lakes of the villages in the plains
While the soil of the fields is growing, the water storage level of the water bodies will also increase.
If empty cement sacks, empty fertilizer bags are filled with stones and soil, then why should water stop coming out of the way
I have always been saying this thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, we can see several places and one of them is worth seeing.
It is also important to know how to save water, how to construct ponds under the house 200 years ago, how clean the water is.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came, several schemes were formulated, so much money was spent. Therefore, it is natural to raise such a question in the minds of crores of people of the country as a model of brother Kumar Krishna.
Those who believe in religious beliefs consider Ganga as a provider of housing.
The Ganga itself gives us work and the Ganga gives us the power to live.
The way the flow of Ganga shines, it gives a boost to the economic activity of the country.
A Pathirathan brought us the Ganges, but crores of oppressors are required to protect it.
We cannot succeed in work without peoples participation. Therefore, we all have to become a change agent for cleanliness and cleanliness.
We must repeat and remind ourselves of this thing.
Several initiatives are being taken by the government.
Efforts are being made to seek full cooperation of all the states on the banks of river Ganga.
Efforts are being made to integrate social and hygienic organizations.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, mass purification and industrial pollution.
Every day solid waste comes in large quantities through canals.
In the coming days, these waste disposal schemes will be implemented in many more places and the people living on the banks of Ganga-Yamuna will be able to enjoy the benefits.
I feel that there will be good results too.
I am extremely glad that some officials have told me that the evacuations from the halls of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in the last few days in terms of zero liquid discharge i. e.
The expulsion of black liquor from paper factories has almost come to an end.
This shows us that we are moving in the right direction and there has been an increase in awareness.
Anyone from not only the banks of the Ganges but also from the far-flung Southern region wants to meet, sir, whether Ganga will be cleaned or not.
It is a matter of trust of the people that it will certainly contribute to the success of cleaning the Ganga.
People are offering donations to clean the Ganga.
The system is being implemented in a very beautiful manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
We celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April, today we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day on 24th April.
This is a coincidence that the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, carried out the mission of Gramodyam to Bharat Uday for 10 days from 14th April to 24th April, in the form of a coincidence of both the great villages of the Constitution, starting the birth anniversary of the Honble President of India, who gave us the Constitution of India.
Today, on 24th April, in Jharkhand, where our tribal brothers and sisters live, I am going to celebrate Panchayati Raj Day. This movement has created a great awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at the village level in all corners of India
How to make the villages self-reliant
How can the villages embrace their own developmental plans
Various events in several villages of India may have taken place in 10 days, but this may have been smaller in size.
I convey my best wishes to all the state governments and the leaders of the village who have been utilising this opportunity for innovatively, innovatively and innovatively in the most basic ways, for the benefit of the villages and for the development of villages.
Awareness in villages is the guarantee of the rise of India.
The source of Bharat Udaya is in the village Udaya itself .
And that is why we all are paying attention to rural upliftment and we will achieve the desired results.
Over the years, there has been a need for development in the education sector.
Today, if every family has a primary dream for the parents then it should provide quality education to the children.
Thinking about housing, vehicle etc. is all the time.
This feeling prevails in the minds of the people of a country like India, this is the greatest strength.
Therefore, the application I apply to all my parents is that you should take some time in detail to the children and discuss the methods of schools.
If something gets up in your mind then go to school and ask the teachers themselves.
This awareness will lead to the reduction of many grievances in our education system and it must be from the peoples participation.
In our country, all the governments have been paying more attention to education and every government has made its own efforts.
It is also true that there has been a considerable period of time when educational institutions should be established, educational institutions should be expanded, schools, colleges should be established, teachers should be included, maximum children should go to school.
In a way, efforts to spread education were primarily achieved and it is also essential.
But the emphasis on expansion needs to be more important than the development of our education system.
We have done a massive work of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary objective is to provide good education through education for all.
It is true that we have to take a long journey.
But if the 125 crore people of the country decide then a long journey will also be possible.
As Sharmila ji has said, it is very important that we make fundamental changes.
Indias universities must also become globally competitive universities.
The importance of education is as important as that of skills as it is, similarly the role of technology in education is going to be enormous.
I am confident that tele-education and technology will facilitate our education and in a short span of time the results will be visible to our eyes.
Prime Minister, I salute Mona Karna from Bijnor.
In today's era, sports is more important than education for the youth.
They need to have tem spirit, team spirit and be a good leader, thereby creating holistic development.
I can say this through my experience because I have been in the organisation of the Indian Scripture, which has had a good impact on my life.
This required greater coordination.
I have been filled with this kind of widespread widespreadness of these people, they have been very excited and something must be done.
I know that I myself have been a shield in the National Cadet Corps and I know that a new outlook is being generated through such organisations.
I had enjoyed the benefits in my childhood, I had to fill up a new energy and give a new impetus to these institutions.
This time I have some things in front of them.
In this season, I asked all our youngsters and organisations why they should not be involved in the great task of water conservation.
How many circles and how many districts can we prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the compulsion that we all have to think.
I also look at this astonishing thing.
You would be aware of the political situation in our country as to how many gas cylinders would be provided by which party was the subject of debate over the last several elections.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing the reduction of subsidies, which led to the formation of a number of groups, which gave suggestions and decisions on subsidies cuts.
Several crores of rupees were spent on these teams.
But today my heart is strained by the pride of the people of my country.
But if we calculate, more than 80 per cent of these 1 crore people went to the distributors themselves, stood in the queue, gave in a written form and discontinued their subsidies.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government exempts a tax rebate, it will receive appreciation for the government on television and newspapers throughout the week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
This event has forced the country's economists to think from a new perspective.
Even the world's economists, who offer many possibilities, are far beyond their thoughts.
We have to think about this at some point of time.
This is an extraordinary thing that if one crore families give up their subsidy and one crore poor families get gas cylinders, if one crore families give up their subsidies then it is a simple thing to look at, how much they can accomplish while working with confidence and confidence in the people.
I urge all the political leaders to rely on the people wherever we go and say something with confidence.
You will get the benefits that you cannot even think.
We have to move in this direction.
For instance, something in my mind was inspired by the fact that at the level 3, why should we conduct a direct examination for the 4th level staff, why should we not trust their selection marks
I also think that there will be no ticket checkers on some railway tracks.
We will trust the people of the country and we will be able to do many such tests.
Once we believe in the people of the country, it will be of immense benefit.
This situation has not been created by political leaders but has created one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written to me - Good News Everyday, good news every day and tell your officers about a good thing every day.
Breaking News is the worst news in every newspaper and in the media.
Is there no good thing in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had also sent me a letter, saying we will not even publish a bad news on Monday, but will release a positive message.
The fact is that there has been an atmosphere of positive news.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be made available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known individual gives a special message, however beautiful words he describes it in a very beautiful way, it will be more beneficial than that.
Good news becomes a focal point for good deeds.
The more we strengthen the cause of good, the lesser the place for evils.
If we light the lamp, the darkness will depart on its own, and surely depart.
You can also contribute in that.
Ravi ji, you have given me good advice but please do not be angry with me.
Let us collectively engage in constructive endeavours, let us talk constructively, let us take part in our efforts to take positive things forward.
Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
Many people of the world are unaware of the fact that millions and millions of people come together on the banks of the river for days.
The festival is being celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events are systematically achieving greater levels of public participation in the programme management angle.
Over the last two days, I have been observing that many people have been upgrading films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India and the tourism departments of the State Governments to hold a photo competition in this regard.
You can ask people to upgrade the best photographs.
This can be done.
During his meeting with the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he told me that special focus has been laid on cleanliness.
The objective of Swachhta is not only during this festival but also to bear the concept of cleanliness in the minds of the people.
I believe that while accepting the Kumbh Mela as a festival related to spirituality, that too can become a social opportunity.
We can use Kumbh Mela to spread the message of how we can increase our love for water, how we can cherish water and how we can spread the message of water conservation.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Though I am going to be able to see me but I am trying to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to you by dedicating it to Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that last time I had spoken about a book comprising of the stories of Bremchand ji and whoever had to read it, share your thoughts with the NarendraModi App.
A large number of people have put forward their views on books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I will surely talk about some other books.
But nowadays I have to admit that I don't have enough time to read more books.
But the experience that we have experienced in the last one month has to be carried forward.
Friends, the fact that I have touched Mann Ki Baat on water conservation is true but even before this, it seems to me that water conservation is something that touches your heart and it is a favourite thing for the common man.
If one thing has been shaking the entire country for a few days then it is water.
Several major efforts are being made to impact water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has stepped up a number of innovative movements on water conservation.
I am glad to know that Meghalaya, the most beautiful northeastern state, has formulated a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
Agricultural sector is being encouraged to cultivate low-water consumption and non-affective crops in Haryana.
Why shouldn't we use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And especially the accomplishments of the children, their successes provide a new energy and enthusiasm to all of us.
The things that I say now can bring you glory and enthusiasm together.
We are well aware of the fact that the word Cancer can be shivering in the world.
While waiting at the doorsteps of death, these ten children, in their struggle for life, have not only led to cancer, but have also praised the country's name for their wonderful work.
This month in Moscow, World Children's Winners Games held World Children's Championships.
The competition was organised for shooting, swimming, swimming, race, timetable and table tennis.
These ten winners of our country have won medals in this medal and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success of Chandrayaan 2 that India has achieved in space, will give you joy and pride.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daka from Kolkata and P.
Many like Arvind Rao have been asking people from different parts of the country to talk to Mann Ki Baat on NarendraModi App and MyGov on Chandrayaan 2.
In the field of space, India has to describe the year 2019 as the best year.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
We were unable to speak much about the great significance of A-Sat in the electoral frenzy.
However, the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the ground in just 3 minutes.
On the 22nd of July, Bong Chandrayaan took a dignified look at the two launches.
Chandrayaan 2 - This goal is significant at various angles.
Chandrayaan 2 will further illuminate our understanding of the moon.
Even in our lives, we will face temporary setbacks
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to present information about a very interesting competition for the student wealth and the youth of the country. I invite our youth to participate in this quiz competition.
Space Knowledge, Indias Space Programme and Science Technology will be the element of this competition.
For example, what is required to be done in rocket launch, how the satellites are placed in orbit, what are we receiving from the satellite, what is A-Sat
On the MyGov web site, the competition will be held on 1st August.
I invite my young friends and students...
I appeal to all the schools, parents and teachers full of enthusiasm to work to make your school successful.
I encourage all the student wealth to be integrated into it.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum marks in every state to Sriharikota at its own expense
They will also get an opportunity to see Chandrayaan landscape on land in September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the cleanliness drive at times
Similarly, efforts towards cleanliness have also been inspired by Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago, today with everyones participation, has set new benchmarks for cleanliness.
I have not said that we have reached the Adarsh level of cleanliness but the success that has been achieved in the cleanliness drive from open defecation to public places, the strength of the commitment of 130 crore countrymen
But we are not going to stop.
This movement is now moving from untouchability to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to learn about Yogi Sena Ji and his team through the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has turned back to serve Mother India after quitting her work in the US.
Sometime back, he took up the challenge of making Delhi clean not only, but also beauty filled.
He joined his crew and began his work from the dustbins in Lodhi Garden.
You can recall how the streets of Prayagraj have merged with paintings on the Kumbh Mela.
I also came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had shown their handiwork there too.
We are also experiencing this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is essential that the principle of waste to wealth should be strengthened in our society and it should become our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days I had to read an interesting comment in MyGov.
This was registered by Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shobian area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I like Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to note that I have contributed positively to the Return of the Village that unites the society in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Action Plan was organised in June.
I think this will be the first action plan that people directly interact with the government.
Several other things have been added to make this project more interesting.
Sports competitions were organized for children under Khelo India programme.
They were given sports equipment, workshops for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment, SCs and Tribal Certificates.
In a way, this festival of development is a celebration of peoples participation and peoples awareness.
People participated in large numbers in this development festival of Kashmir.
While it is a matter of satisfaction that this programme of Return of Villages has been carried out in the neighbouring villages, the government officials climbed the difficult mountains to reach such remote villages and took a day or two walking journey.
The officers also visited the Sadasar period and the border villages along the border, without any fear of the most nervous areas of Shobian, Bulwama, Kulgaon and Anantnag districts.
Their reception had so much impact on many officers that they had spent more than two days in these villages.
All these are comfortable in organising Gram Sabhas in these areas, ensuring greater peoples participation and ensuring their own programmes.
New commitment, new enthusiasm and wonderful results.
This makes it clear that everybody intends to sow obstacles and greed in the journey of development will never succeed in their valued months.
My dear countrymen, do you know how Dattatreya Ramachandra Vendre ji has written in one of his poems about Marikaalam
People from different cultures and languages across India have been celebrating the festival in their own right.
If we look around in this season then the earth will be seen as if some cow had wrapped a cover over it.
A new energy penetrates all around.
In this holy month, many devotees take a cave, Amarnath yatra, many are fasting and are eagerly waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
This is the time when Raksha Bandhan is also the manifestation of the love and affection of brothers and sisters.
And when we talk about Maritime, you will be happy to know that this time during the Amarnath Yatra, devotees have been participating in more than four years.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people who participated in this pilgrimage for 60 days in 2015, this time the number has crossed in just 28 days.
I would like to specially congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality behind the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Everyone who has returned after completing his journey has been attracted by the hospitality and hospitality of the people of the state.
All this will be very useful for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttarakhand, the sacred pilgrimage has begun this year and in just one and a half months, more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple only.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity of 2013, people have made a pilgrimage to such a large number of people.
I request you all to visit some places of beauty in the season of monsoon, wherever you may be in the country.
There cannot be a greater Asan than tourism and pilgrimage to see such a beautiful place of our country, to feel the feelings of the people of our country.
May this beautiful and vital month of Maritime bring new energy, new hope and new aspirations to all of you.
Likewise, in August, the White Movement is bearing the memories of the quit movement.
On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in different parts of the country and in many areas people of the country are affected by floods.
When we watch the rain on television, we get a glimpse of it.
I will come back after a month's wait.
Today, people from all over the world from Christian community are celebrating Easter Thirunal.
Today, as India dances with Australia, I extend my best wishes to both the soldiers.
India won the Gold in the 1951-1962 Asian Games and the 4th in the 1956 Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have moved to the lowest level in the rankings.
Today, if our position in the FIFA rankings has fallen, it is difficult to give up.
In today's era, be it the EPL or the Spanish League or the Indian Super League, I can see the increasing interest in football among the youth of India today.
Youth of India are watching television channels to know more about calendar.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity to take footprints to every village and every street.
If the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup is such an opportunity, then in this one year we will have to strive to refresh the innovation and enthusiasm of the youth in all four directions.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
My dear student wealth, you people are planning to go on holidays.
Only a few people go abroad, most of them go to their states for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people go to other states other than their states.
Whether I am a non-communicable district in India or not
There is a great strength for tourism in the making of our lives. Nowadays, the youth of India is showing great interest in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
Everybody wants to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think this is a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if you keep your hands black with coal, others will run away automatically.
But it gives me pleasure to set up a tourist circuit with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have experienced coal mine tourism in a suitable manner in the vicinity of Sawaner village near Nagpur.
It offers an opportunity to see something innovative.
Can you contribute towards cleanliness when you visit other places during this holiday
This may not have been done very scientifically, but what is happening is true.
Can you, as a tourist, act as a tourist and strengthen the concept of Swachhta at the tourist destination
Tourism in India is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 1. 25 billion people decide to strengthen our tourism sector with one mind then we can attract the world.
Come, let us strive in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like the days of my vacation or the passing away.
You should also think from this point of view.
Should your vacation days, the glorious years of life, let their significance go wastefully
I'm putting forth a point of your mind.
Can you develop a skill during your vacation, can you add a new thing to your personality in such a way that you can take pride in it
If you dont know swimming, if you dont know that I will learn swimming during vacation or if you dont know how to ride on a cycle then you can decide that I will learn to ride a cycle.
Even today if I am typing a computer with two fingers, can I do a signature training
How many capabilities are there to nurture our personality, right
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our grievances
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Think about this thing that there is no need for big training, no trainee, no need for higher fees, no big cost.
There will be discussions with other friends like this.
I am sure you will do this and tell me what you have learnt newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Honourable Prime Minister, you have said that during the last summer vacation, the heat of the birds will increase to the heat, so we should put water in a vessel for them in the balcony or in the house floor so that they get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, and through this I got so many friends with birds.
This time again I urge you to express it in your Mann Ki Baat.
He used to telephone and reminded me of a good deed.
I was asking you to keep water in soil vessels outside your house in the summer season.
Abhi has told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year so that many birds are in love with him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the greatest poets of the Hindi literature world, had an immense affection towards the birds.
He said that in his poems, I will not allow you to go away, I will fill the bread with grains, I will fill the water with cold water everywhere.
Shilpa Kooke from Mysore has put forward a very precise idea.
Have we ever given them drink water
My heartfelt thanks to Shilpa, you have put forward a very emotional idea very naturally.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India.
For some people, this Digital India can be a subject related to the youth of some city.
If you upgrade the App for the convenience of these farmers on your mobile phones then you will get all the information related to agriculture and weather in your hands.
Many information can be obtained from the markets, what is the situation in the markets, what is the trend of good harvest, what kind of pests are favourable.
If you ask them questions, they answer them or understand them in an understanding manner.
I would like my farmer brothers and sisters to upgrade the App for this facility on their mobile phones.
We have taken the initiative to create assets for water conservation through Manrekha.
There may be many villages that have created such awareness in the country, many leading farmers, many aware citizens.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics indicate that 3 percent of all deaths are due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types - Type 1, and Type 2.
Type 1 is genetically hereditary and can be caused by parents.
Type 2 is due to habits, due to age, due to obesity.
It has been set up as the theme of World Health Day on 7th, since diabetes has caused concern around the world.
Our lifestyle has become a major reason for this.
Physical labour is declining.
Can we embrace diabetes in our lives by the 7th of April
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we are not doing a medical check-up with difficulty.
Only after the situation worsens, it is known that diabetes has been prevalent for a long time.
Our country is declining as compared to the number of TB patients in other countries.
This disease can be cured by proper treatment.
India must be free from the clutches of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated by governments, doctors and medicines alone.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to eradicate diabetes and eradicate TB.
My dear countrymen, several important events will take place in April, particularly on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th Birth Anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
On April 14 this year, I had the privilege of visiting Mhow, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us everything necessary to become a better citizen.
We can pay a special tribute to him by traveling on his path shown by him and living as a good citizen.
Vikram will start his year in a few days.
New Year is being celebrated in different states in different forms.
My New Year greetings to everyone.
I have said this thing last time that you can hear my Mann Ki Baat whenever you want to hear it, you know this thing, you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask for it at a comfortable time.
Let's hear it on your mobile phone.
I am delighted to be with you all.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Easter.
My young friends, all of you will be on the one hand in the exam.
There is a wonderful spirit.
Perhaps you are aware that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in our country in 2017.
What I mean to say is that the interest in footprints increases, but when we touch the gates of India, can we fulfill our responsibilities only by keeping our duties intact
Last time also I had requested you to upload the photographs of the place where you are going.
Crores of neighbours of the country have done the work that was not done by the tourism sector, which was not done by our cultural sector, which was not done by the state governments and the government of India.
It is really enjoyable to see all the photographs they have done.
We have to take this task forward and do it the same way but do something else this time.
Its not just a photograph, but also an exhibition of your creativity and a lot of things can be observed while visiting and visiting new places.
India is a country full of diversity.
And if you start travelling once then you will keep on travelling throughout your life and you will keep enjoying yourself.
Normally, we should stay away from coal mines.
When we look at the pictures of the residents, we will think what will happen there.
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Let us all join hands in this task, be it the government, the institutions, the society or the citizens.
Your personality will be recognised and your self-confidence will increase to a great extent.
Those who sell milk near our homes, those who sell newspapers, those who come to the post offices, sometimes those who sell utensils or those who sell fabrics go through it.
Have we ever heard if the heat of summer is burning and their thirst is not needed
Only then can a drop of rainwater be used without waste.
The beginning of farming for the farmers is very important.
But if there is no water then the people of the country should also think about what happens.
You might have noticed that this time 5 lakh lakes are trying to construct irrigation ponds.
I still remember that people get scared as soon as I heard the name DB at my young age.
If one has to get rid of TB then proper treatment is essential and complete treatment is important.
If he leaves half the treatment in the middle, the disease will come back.
You give Miss Call, whenever you get time, you can listen to the ancient Mann Ki Baat programmes and listen in your language.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
In a way, this is my concluding Mann Ki Baat programme of 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat programme will be held in 2016.
In a way, it can be said that every festival leaves the expectation of the next festival when it will come.
Perhaps India can be said to be an economy that is being promoted by festivals.
These are due to the economic activity of the people at the bottom of the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the Christmas festival and my best wishes for 2016.
May the year 2016 bring immense joy and happiness to all of you, the new enthusiasm, the new strategy and the new resolve will take you all towards new heights.
Whether it is terrorism or global warming or natural calamities, the complications created by man.
What could be a greater joy than this that humanity should be saved from all these things and lead a peaceful life
Chawle Savarkar Ji is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists visit and people visit many places for Christmas festivals
I welcome Ganesh ji's remarks that how clean our tourist destinations are and how much India's thoughts and image will be enhanced in the minds of others.
I am bringing Ganesh ji's ideas among the people.
If we come in the tradition of seeing the guests as gods, if the guests come to our houses then we will immediately engage in washing the house, cleaning it or not
Similarly, we need to keep our tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations clean and clean in our country.
I am glad that news has come from all over the country about cleanliness.
Since the beginning of the day, I have congratulated my friends in the media for this thing.
Because they take small and good things out and take them to the public.
And I would like to share this thing with you people that just now I had to read this thing that he had constructed hundreds of toilets in Bhojpura village because of his hard work.
The country is making rapid strides because of the relentless efforts made by many.
The 125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of development shoulder to shoulder and are progressing the country.
Efficient education, improved skills and increasing employment opportunities
Life Insurance Schemes for Citizens, banking facilities, universal access to businesses and setting up of new enterprises and start-ups are on the one hand.
Now all the simple families who cannot even go near the banks are getting loans easily through the Mudra Yojana.
Indians have started to understand that nowadays Yoga has started to engage in the world.
When the whole world celebrated International Day of Yoga then how proud our country was, didn't we
This feeling will come to us only when our thoughts and thoughts are widespread.
And it came to pass, when the eye of the butter, and his mother opened the mouth of Joshua, that, behold, who can forget that which she saw there
Similarly, Yoga Day has shown us the importance of India.
Nowadays there is talk of cleanliness in every household.
And this is a very positive thing that the government officials who have been engaged in the work of bringing electricity to those villages have a feeling that they have been the cause of a change in the lives of a farmer, poor, a young man or a mother.
Can't I just do everything alone
But when I talk about it, should I also contribute to it
An ordinary citizen can also connect with me by upgrading an App called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone.
I am sharing simple things in this.
I am glad that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us collectively engage in matters related to the interests of the common man, bring them to the common man and give them a sense of pride.
My dear young friends, on 15th August, from the Red Fort, I had put forward a fundamental concept related to Startup India and Stand Up India.
Thereafter, all the departments of the government were focused on this thing.
Can India become the Start Up Capital
Start up India and Stand Up India have provided a huge opportunity for younger communities.
My dear young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India is going to launch the start-up India and stand-up India programme in full swing.
The Start-up is a steady idea that we have about start-ups that the digital world is only for those who are in IT and IT.
We have to make changes in keeping with the requirements of India.
The intellectual talent of our younger generation spreads across the country.
This start-up should not be left in India, stand-up in India or in some other city, it should spread to every corner of India.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this scheme forward.
I am going to have a detailed discussion with you on the 16th of January.
I am eagerly looking forward to your views.
My young friends, on January 12, the birthday of Swami Vivekananda.
There are crores of people in this country like me.
We are celebrating the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda from 1995 to January 12, as National Youth Day.
The festivals are scheduled to be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January this year.
I especially urge my young friends to send your suggestions directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to understand and know what is in your mind.
Dilip Chauhan from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is a visually impaired person, who observed Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet human beings like him in our lives, there will be united thoughts in our hearts.
The perception of human beings like him will be expressed on the basis of our thoughts.
There is no doubt that words have a significance.
This year when the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat scheme, arrangements were made for me to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there because of the terrible floods and I could not participate in this programme.
Even though I could not participate in this programme, my mind was filled with thoughts.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, easily accessible parking lots, lifts, frequent language writing in all respects require innovations, technology requirements, systems and understanding.
They should not be paralysed in the files and decayed.
Even schemes were not created for the common man and the poor
A few days back efforts were made to ensure that the beneficiaries could get the benefits of the scheme in an easy manner.
Subsidy is being given to gas cylinders in our country.
Crores of rupees are being spent for this but no accounting case has been filed.
The government has made a small change in grants to know whether the subsidy is reaching the real beneficiaries or not and whether it is reaching on time or not.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Pahal Gas scheme.
Direct subsidy is being given to the bank accounts of these 15 crore beneficiaries.
This happens without the possibility of middlemen, sipariso and corruption.
On the one hand, the Aadhar ID movement, Jan Dhan account opening on the other hand, and on the other hand, the Central State Governments are working to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link them to Aadhaar ID and Bank Account.
There were unanimous allegations regarding the scheme.
In many places, money is being put directly into the bank accounts of workers who worked.
40000 crores has been directly deposited into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries of about 35, 40 projects so far.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of January is a golden moment for the Republic of India.
It is a very interesting coincidence that this day marks the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to take this forward.
Only during the elections, there will be more advertising, layers on the walls and layers on the walls.
We will talk more about duties during elections but why shouldn't we talk about the same duties in everyday life
This year, as we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can we organise essay competitions, poetry competitions and dialogue competitions in schools, colleges, in our villages and cities, in different societies and societies for the purpose of obligation
When 1. 25 billion people of the country take it forward with a sense of duty, then how big a history will be created.
On the 26th of January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, cannot the statues of the Presidents of our city be purified and adorned very specially by the citizens through school-calloury students and the places around it
I put forward the idea of doing this as a citizen.
We reflect the indifference towards the maintenance of the statues of those leaders whom we are engrossed in laying the statues.
Can we continue to do cleanliness as a society and as a country
We will join hands in this effort on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, once again my New Year greetings for 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the start of the Christmas festival is going on.
There is a separate place for festivals in social life.
Festivals are sometimes useful to heal wounds and sometimes they give a new impetus.
But sometimes when there are difficulties during the festive days, they are extremely distressed.
From every corner of the world, reports of natural calamities continue to flow.
Till now, there are reports of disasters that have not been questioned.
We are now experiencing the speed at which the impact of climate change is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and disaster relief operations throughout the country.
The central government has always been working shoulder to shoulder as well.
I am confident that Tamil Nadu will resurrect these difficulties and contribute to the progress of the country.
But when we face this difficult situation in all four directions, there is a feeling of a change.
Until about 15 years ago, natural calamity was associated with agriculture because at that time natural calamity was only with drought and famine.
Governments, civil society, civil society, small and big organizations have to work in this area of capacity building in a scientific manner.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to interact with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that the South Asian countries should jointly take up a joint activity to prepare for the disaster.
I am glad that a Concept Workshop on Disaster Risk Reduction and a Seminar on Best Practices has been organized in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I speak to Lakwindar Singh from the Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming here and are also guiding many others in agriculture.
One of the reasons is that you are doing organic farming.
It is a matter of great happiness that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is justified but this is not going to happen only in the states of Punjab and Haryana.
This is our routine throughout India and traditionally we are burning the agricultural waste after cultivation.
Earlier we were unaware of the evils caused by this kind of burning fire and everyone was doing it so I was doing it too.
This has led to a steady increase in climate change and it is now associated with climate change.
After the impact of this difficulty began to reach the cities, the voices of popular opposition began to sound.
That's the real concern you're expressing in that respect.
In the first phase, we should train our farmer friends and explain the truth to them.
Burning of post-harvest agricultural waste can save time, reduce the difficulty and make the land ready for the next start.
But this is not the right procedure.
The post-harvest agricultural waste is also very precious.
They are naturally fertile.
We're wasting them.
Moreover, if we make them small pieces, they can be a feast for the cattle.
Secondly, when we burn them, the surface of the ground burns.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment, our bones are firm, our heart works well, our kidneys work properly, everything is fine but if the skin on the body burns then can we survive
Just as the skin of our body is burnt, we cannot survive, similarly if we burn the post-harvest straw and agricultural residue, the skin of the mother earth burns and the layer of our land burns.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got an opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in banana cultivation.
They shared their wonderful experiences with me.
Earlier, after harvesting their lives, they had to spend 5000, 10,000 and 15,000 rupees per hectare.
No work was going on until the people had to be picked up and carried out in tractors.
Last time I had spoken about organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
In this regard, I mentioned the NOTO free phone number.
Film actress Raveena Dandon and other prominent personalities participated in it.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What could be a bigger donation than this
The National Level Organ Registration Centre (NLRC) was launched on November 27, covering details of patients and organ donors waiting for organs.
I am confident that this sector will also spread awareness and the needy people will get help in time.
Because this help will not be available in any way until one doesn't want to donate.
I had earlier said that we will be observing 3rd December as Divyangjans Day.
Physically, persons with disabilities have unparalleled courage and extraordinary capabilities.
Sometimes when they are depicted as caricatures, the mind feels painful.
Sometimes Karuna and Thai are being expressed on them.
But if we change our perspective, if we rectify our vision then they will become a concept for us as well, they will become a source of inspiration for us to achieve.
It is a matter of great appreciation that their dedication, their ability to convert even the difficulties faced by them into favourites.
Today, I would like to talk about Javed Ahmad ji, 40-42 years old.
In 1996, terrorists fired at Jawad Ahmad in Kutch.
But Javeth Ahmad did not accept defeat.
The wounds of extremism did not make him coward.
A man who did not commit any crime had a sentence like this, his youth was ruined, but there was no anger or anger in his mind.
Although he has not collaborated, he has been dedicated to child education for the past 20 years.
As a social worker, as an aware citizen, he is doing a peace revolution today as the sovereign sovereign of the Divyangjans.
Is it not sufficient that Javeth ji's life becomes a conception for all Indians
I would like to especially commemorate the life and dedication of Shri Javed ji on the 3rd of December.
Today, even though I am able to talk about Javeth Ji only because of the shortage of time, even then all the corners of India are hiding and encouraging to live.
In that context, on the 3rd of December, we have to draw inspiration from them.
In many cases, we are compelled to work with governments.
The people of the central elite, the people living below the middle class, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the oppressed, the oppressed and the oppressed are all connected to the government and the government related organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they have somehow had a bad experience with government employees.
These couples are spending their wealth on the development of the poor during their retirement.
The entire population of Dhantaga, the smallest village in Balasore district of Odisha, belongs to the tribal community.
The poorest village that falls under poverty is the condition of malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an Asha volunteer from this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from the village of Denthaga dies of malaria.
He stepped up the struggle against malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
There can be so many such bells in the country.
You should not only read but also recommend others.
Constructive energy is the greatest energy.
Share the good events related to this, share these e-books and discuss this.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is deeply concerned about climate change.
National Energy Conservation Day on 14th December
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
LED bulb mission is progressing as a drive.
On the day of Purnami, once I had asked you to shut down the street lights and wash the lights for an hour in the moonlight.
A friend had sent a link to me and I got the opportunity to see it.
I wanted to share this with you.
He has been trying to illuminate the poor by using solar energy, he has been fighting with darkness and has been working in accordance with his name, he has formed a group of women.
He has also inaugurated a workshop for electrifying the solar-powered Lander.
He is providing these lander lights at a cost of 100 rupees per month.
People buy these lamps in the evening and give them electrification in the morning.
As far as I have heard, about 500 households are being provided with this kind of electric generators.
Noorjahan has been working on electrifying these landers throughout the day.
But a good start has been made.
66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana in a very short time.
I am glad that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I had earlier said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
Sailesh Bhonsle has vindicated this.
I am told that he has been doing this by buying a tanker and has already repaid a loan of Rs 2 lakh to the bank in a short span of time.
This is our objective of the Mudra Yojana.
Mamta Sharma from Bhopal was also told about this thing.
He also got Rs 40,000 from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is working on making handpumps.
It saves around 1000 rupees per month because there is no need to pay higher interest.
His family also had a good job.
But I would like this scheme to be more popular and expanded.
All our banks have to approach this with greater understanding and come forward to help small businesses in a big way.
In fact, they are the economic directors of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
This is what we want to inspire.
Good thing has happened, but this should be done more and more effectively.
This means that the price of freedom is the price of liberty, which means that the price of freedom is always waking up.
The word 'unity of the country' must continue to sound.
But I look forward to further suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely benefit.
My dear brothers and sisters, Winter is about to start.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen Jai Hind
Once again I have got the opportunity to interact with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
Gandhi Mandela series has been named for the 5-day cricket tournament.
Therefore, interest in the final competition has increased.
My good wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all the friends at the All India Radio station.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the comrades of the Kannur Radio Station.
I would like to mention Kerala once again today.
A letter has been sent to me by the students of Dhuya Mary Upper Primary School in Chittor, Kerala.
The letter is unique in many ways.
On the one hand, these girls enrolled their thumbs and dressed Bharat Mata's tune in a huge cloth.
They have sent me a map of Bharat Mata.
I was surprised to know why they dragged the film with their thumbs and mips.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I was able to understand how big the message they had sent to me.
They are engaged in organ donation awareness campaigns.
Vasanth Rao Chuduke, about 80 years old from Maharashtra, has been running a movement for a long time.
He wants organ donation to be celebrated as a function.
Nowadays I have been receiving a lot of news and phone calls.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent me such a message.
I am happy to note that the government's efforts towards organ donation and policies related to organ donation from Delhi.
Countries like China are in a very advanced position in organ donation and it is a matter of great significance for me that the government's goal of donating one million organs is appreciable.
The country requires more than 2. 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver organ donation every year.
But in a country of 125 crore people, only 5000 organ transplants can be implemented.
There is a need to provide light to millions of eyes every year.
But only 25,000 of us can give tears.
If 4 people need eyes, only one person can be given the same.
Efforts are being made to guide the State Governments in this regard.
Some States have made good progress in their efforts to simplify and speed up administrative processes.
I would like to say that Tamil Nadu stands first in organ donation.
A 24-hour helpline 1800 11 4770 is also being served.
Our ancestors are also shouting that the honeymoon is Punjeetha or not
That is, the joy in sacrificing is the mantra of honey-daya-daya-punjeetha.
In the last few days, GST of Delhi has increased from Rs.
The successful operation saved one life.
A few days later, we are also celebrating Deepavali.
We also celebrated the Golden uadrilateral Festival.
India-Africa Forum Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2018.
This is the first time that such a massive conference is being organized on Indian soil.
Heads of 54 African countries and Unions are invited to attend the conference.
The population of our two countries is one-third of the world's population.
Millions of years ago, India and Africa were the only catalyst and later became two parts of the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of solidarity between us.
India's wildlife and wildlife of Africa can be seen in many similarities.
There is a lot of similarity in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have lived in African countries for many years.
India and Africa have linkages in the fields of economy, culture and politics.
But above all, India has played a major role in imparting training to the younger generation of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in India for human resource development and capacity building.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is organising an excellent event.
Competitions are being organised among students of all schools affiliated to CBSE, writing poetry and enhancing their participation.
Tens of thousands of schoolchildren had written about the Indian African connections.
Millions of school students visited this exhibition, the people of the village saw, and people came to know and understood how Gandhijis contribution towards the relationship between Africa and India was, how his impact was on the minds of the people of both the lands.
There were many outstanding contributions in the competition.
I like a poem that is a robbery of my heart, so I want to teach you this thing.
I congratulate Kurukshetra and all the students who have participated in this competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On 15th August 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and the Model Gram Yojana of the Parliament.
Since then, many members have completed this work.
They are engaged in it with all their heart.
A concept workshop was held in Bhopal last month.
The Model Gram Yojana (MGVY) was jointly organised by the leaders of the villages, district collectors, some MPs and officials from the Central State Governments and intensive consultations on the Model Gram Yojana.
It gave rise to a number of new ideas and inspired them.
I would like to bring some things to your attention.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it is the Mao extremists, the bomb culture and the massacre that we recall when we talk about Jharkhand.
Many areas have been destroyed by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
But our senior Parliamentarian, Kariya Munda, who has worked as the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of that region, has dedicated his life for the tribal people.
He started walking there, showered confidence in the people, made efforts to revive government institutions and encouraged the officers to come and work there.
He established a country that has long been neglected to bring development to the region.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Gram Yojana, a successful effort to create awareness among the people came to this village of Parsi in Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the respected MP Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are being made and he has made a special innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to students studying in the schools there.
He called upon school students studying in upper classes to educate their parents in this class.
The school provided education to students and their parents in the morning and evening.
The same children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
See, how a big change has been brought about in the society without any budget, without a circular and without any special facility just by a determination of mind.
This is the lesson given by Dwarapuri Gram Panchayat to us.
This village is known for sugarcane production and sugarcane fair.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the Sugarcane Festival on 11th March in this village.
He has drawn our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of one thing that after the festival of Diwali last year, a movement was organised in our country, especially in the media.
The more we try to clean before the festivals, the more you do it, the more you do it after the festivals, the more you do it.
Our work should be done in every public function.
Today, I congratulate all the media in India.
On 2nd October last year, Gandhijis birth anniversary and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan were marked by the privilege of participating in the Safai Giri organised by India Today Group.
He has been encouraging Swachhta work for the past one year through ETV and has been published in his newspapers and he has only concentrated on constructive work.
He has linked 51 lakh children from 55 to 56000 schools in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Be it public places or railway stations or pilgrimage centres or hospitals or parks, he has been conducting cleanliness drives in many places.
These reports also strengthen the creation of a Clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme entitled India My Nation.
In the wake of the awareness about cleanliness among the people, the people of the country had sown the idea of cleanliness in their minds.
NDTV has organised a campaign to make a Clean India.
There are several channels and newspapers in our country and I cannot mention the names of all, but everybody has taken this movement because of the lack of time.
For the past several years, this village has been working towards cleanliness and every generation has been working towards cleanliness.
A few years ago, the Governor wrote in the letter that the village has been awarded Asia's most clean village.
I am glad that a village in Meghalaya, remote Northeast of our country has been engaged in the field of cleanliness for years.
It has become a village culture.
Such events have given us confidence that our country is definitely clean.
My dear countrymen, when I was speaking from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that corruption had become cheaper in the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
We made an important announcement in the last budget.
Accordingly, you can pay your gold to the bank and get the interest on your investment as well as the gold that is saved in the bank.
Gold will now be in the bank, but it will be credited to you by the bank interest.
Now tell the people of the country whether gold will be rich or not
Would it not turn into a full-fledged golden agent
Do not keep gold in the house in vain.
Two profits - security and circulation - do not miss its benefits.
So we dont have to buy gold, we dont have to protect gold, we do not want to steal the paper.
I will definitely dedicate this scheme to the people of the country next week.
However, we have so far utilised the foreign currency or have been using foreign gold trunks.
Why shouldn't there be an indigenous index for our country
Therefore, in the coming week, before the auspicious day of Danteras, gold coins of 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra will be released.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be distributed to the people.
I am sure that this new project will bring a new change in the path of economic development and I am confident that your entire cooperation will be with me.
My dear countrymen, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
When Patel thought of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, then the entire India would be inspired.
This great man has contributed immensely to India's unity.
These are not just the differences but the beauty that has given us pride will not reach us.
Therefore, only differences are the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last several years, the Unity Run was on 31st October.
I got the opportunity to participate in it earlier.
I have been told that arrangements are being made in different areas this time too and people are preparing for unity with enthusiasm.
The drive to unity is indeed the drive towards development.
In other words, unity is the guarantee for development.
Let us convey our blessings to Sardar Ji.
Let us take the mantra of unity forward.
My dear brothers and sisters, all of you are preparing for the festival of Deepavali.
Enjoy the festival of Deepavali, but I especially urge my parents to keep abreast of the harm that our children don't have to face even adversely, and we have to do something for cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain the next day of Diwali.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am sure that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for our children to study in Britain.
Learning as much as possible as possible and living for the country - this is the message of Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself, he did not live.
The work that Lord Basaveshwara has done for democracy and empowerment of women many years ago is a matter of pride for everyone to know.
The dedication of the Thiruvananthapuram Statue of Lord Basaveshwara to the people of the world in London is an excellent example of the vision and vision of Indias great souls over centuries ago.
When this kind of event comes together, the hearts of the people of the country are filled with consciousness.
Your suggestions are coming to me through this medium.
Then with your letters programmes are being prepared on All India Radio, government officials are invited to discuss and some are trying to find solutions when they write about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
Though I have learnt some languages, it is true that I cannot learn so many languages.
I will definitely try to enter your minds at 8pm in your language.
Look how beautiful our relationship is.
The last one year was over
Today we are calling for a new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all, this is the 12th episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I have great significance for the peoples power in the democracies.
There is an idea that is the basis of my life because of which I have great faith in this peoples power.
But Mann Ki Baat has taught many things, they have experienced them and we all know how great the peoples power is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Shakti Mahesan Shakti.
I can say that there is a great power and a great truth in the minds of our ancestors by the experiences that I have experienced in Mann Ki Baat.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio, they have not looked upon these suggestions merely as papers, they have seen them as the expectations of the people.
In terms of administration, the basic principle is that information should be from the bottom to the bottom and guidance should be from the top to the bottom.
Who would have imagined that Mann Ki Baat will become a source of information
But that's how it happened.
On October 2, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
There was a time when there were doors for the country but today there should not be rooms for fashion or not
It's not too much. Buy some.
I am glad to note that in the last one year, the sale of rafts has been almost two parts.
It is difficult for the common man, the middle class and the lower middle class to discontinue the subsidy.
And yet they were driven away from it.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Isn't this a manifestation of people's power
Beyond the bureaucracy of the government departments, the governments must learn the lessons that are capable, efficient and committed.
After Mann Ki Baat programme, all these things became my commitment.
Therefore, today, through Mann Ki Baat, once again I would like to salute the peoples power.
People took up the small things that I had said and took them for the welfare of the country and added them to it.
What could be more joyous than this
This time I thought of handling a new approach in Mann Ki Baat.
I had requested the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Consultations have been collected from all parts of India so that there is no place for invitations.
It's a pleasant experience.
All age groups have given suggestions.
Some suggestions were to be comfortable, others are being taken care of.
You may have spoken for a minute or two but as far as I am concerned, your suggestions and news are very important.
The government will certainly pay full attention to your suggestions.
It generally appears that negative thoughts are full of negative thoughts on all four sides.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, calls from persons with disabilities, particularly those with visually impaired, received more calls.
They can't watch televisions and ask for radio.
Pavan Acharya ji from Alwar in Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want the people of the country to listen and follow the advice of Pawan Acharya ji.
My name is Pawan Acharya, I belong to Alwar in Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I appeal to the people of our country, to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, to make an appeal in his Mann Ki Baat, to the people of the country, to the people of the country, to utilize the maximum number of earthen lamps.
He added that such use of soil cannot pollute the environment while providing employment to thousands of soil poultry poor.
When we listen to the advice of Pawan Acharya during the coming festivals, I would like to appeal to the people of the country that if we listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya then the soil lights will be installed in our homes but its light will spread in the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, during the Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the elders.
On the completion of 50 years of the 1965 war with Pakistan, an exhibition titled 'Anjali to Gallantry' is being organised near India Gate in Delhi.
We have been questioning the glorious moments of war, the unparalleled adventure and sacrifice of our soldiers, the photographs of that period or the pictures of that period.
If you want to create history, you should understand the nuances of history very well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our nature and we should also provide the means for it.
I don't think it's wrong.
I can clearly see that the Parliament of the country also engages in discussions on cleanliness.
On the other hand, what can be a matter of pride for the country rather than the fact that on one hand Parliament and on the other hand both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness
The movement of ideas, an ecosystem against pollution, has created an awareness about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
He once said that if I want to choose one between freedom and cleanliness then first of all I would like cleanliness and then only the country's independence.
Cleanliness was more important than Gandhiji's independence.
Kulshan Arora from Delhi has registered a information on MyGov portal.
He wanted to know about the centenary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji.
Even last year, I had said that there could be different types of fashion dresses and different types of dresses, but I had asked them to stay with me for dresses.
I request you to give some room for it.
Last time you almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have completed the work with a small help that the government could not spend several crores of rupees.
This is the peoples power itself, so I appeal to you all again in this regard.
My dear countrymen, my heart is also filled with joy for another thing.
I would like to share this with you.
In May, I went to Kolkata and the family members of Subhas Bose had come to meet me.
His brother, son Chandra Bose, had arranged for the meeting.
It was decided last week that more than 50 families of Subhas Bose would be coming to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how this is a matter of great happiness for me
Many of Subhas Babu's family live in other countries.
I am very happy to know that everyone is coming for this thing specially.
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to make this a habit.
I would like the youth of the country to make efforts to join the electoral roll and participate in the vote.
I am sure that during the elections, one thing is being said, first thing is voting and then everything else.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
I met a young man studying in the seventh grade Kshitij Pandey.
He is studying at the 7th grade in Kendriya Vidyalaya at Banaras Hindu University.
Likewise, there was an opportunity to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
The 9 year old girl who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of Sadavruj Patel.
She's a woman from a poor family.
The whole song is under the head of the girl, but the biggest thing is that when she asked about any slogan of the Geetha, she submitted it and explained its English language.
When I asked her father about this, she said she was telling her from her 5th year.
He added that this is a surprise to all of us in the family.
This had a great impact on me in itself.
Some children have an interest in popularity, but child Sonamu has no such involvement.
I only felt that God had given her some special power.
It is a special thing that I have met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month you have to make Mann Ki Baat a week because we get more consciousness from it.
Sandeep ji, don't you know what you want to get from me
Now this is perfect once a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how Subhas Babu used Vanavala
In Germany, he started broadcasting through radio for people living in India.
Azad Hind Radio was launched through a weekly press report.
He broadcast radio in many languages English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu and Pashtu.
I too have completed one year of my radio broadcast through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Your contribution is invaluable to me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
Once again I have got the opportunity to inform you about the voice of my mind.
In the southern part of the country, people are celebrating Onam and yesterday the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated throughout the country.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, everyone has joined these schemes in a broader way.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had made a small request to our sisters to deliver the benefits of these security schemes.
I am told that nearly 11 crore families have been linked to this scheme in a short span of time.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are mothers and sisters.
I think this is a good sign.
My best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan scheme in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a plan that could not be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short time.
However, it is heartening to note that all the departments related to implementation of this scheme, all the branches of the banks, with all their might and zeal have been involved in this thing and we have been successful in this thing that we have so far received about 17.
They have saved 22,000 crores of rupees even when it was said they could start zero balance accounts.
One of the major sources of economy is the banking sector, which has reached the homes of the poor.
Today 1.
25 lakh bank comrades are on the field.
This has provided employment to the youth.
Now thousands of people have been empowered to take overdraft due to Jan Dhan Yojana.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all stakeholders and I appeal to all the poor not to ever cut off your links with the banks.
Banks are yours and you don't get away with it in any way.
We have brought the banks to the doorsteps of your homes, do not leave it, take hold of it strictly.
There should be money in our bank accounts as well.
I have unwavering belief that you will certainly do this.
Just a few days ago, the events in Gujarat, violence and hysteria have caused the entire nation to lose peace, this is a natural feeling.
It is a matter of deep sorrow and anguish for all the people of the country that such an incident has taken place on the land of birth of Gandhi and Sardar.
Peace, solidarity and brotherhood - this path is right
On the path of progress, we all have to walk shoulder to shoulder.
Progress alone can solve all our problems.
Indias first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud to be part of this programme where Buddhist clerics from all over the world will participate.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I have been told several times that I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My beloved farmers should not die, they must not be scared.
I assure you that we will not take any action in order to guide you on the wrong path in order to make you feel terrified.
For us, every citizen of the country has a respect but there is a special significance for the views and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
The deadline for the Ordinance will be expired by 31st August, 2019.
This will ensure that the farmers do not suffer economically.
I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that for us Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not just slogans but it is a mantra.
The welfare of the poor farmers living in villages is in our hearts.
Therefore, I had mentioned in my Independence Day speech that the Ministry should work not just in the field of agriculture but also in the field of agriculture and farmers welfare.
We are taking this resolution forward at a rapid pace.
I'd like to talk about one more thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
Whenever we talk about the war in 1965, it is a natural thing to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are also reminded of us.
Our scientists are really making great strides.
Several new information has been given to me.
This was conceptualising and educating for me.
Several young scientists very quickly shared things with me and I had many dreams in their eyes.
Even in the last Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should lead our student wealth towards science.
Even during my Independence Day speech, I had spoken about the importance of direct examination in the lower levels.
When the direct examination calls, every poor family and widowed mothers have to rotate on matters relating to receiving letters of recommendations and seeking help from whom to get jobs.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the grassroots.
I had said that there should not be a direct examination under certain conditions.
I am glad that the government is making rapid strides in this direction and suggestions are being made. This resolution will almost be passed and the system of direct examination for grass root level posts will be tired.
Today, there are multinational personalities coming to India.
24 countries of the world jointly organized a conference in India to implement call to action plans to reduce maternal and mortality rates.
For the first time outside the United States, this thought meeting was held in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after childbirth.
Just as we were released from polio, we have also been released from the tetanus, a cause of maternal and child deaths.
The world has accepted this.
But even today we have to save our mothers and save our children.
Brothers and sisters, today, dengue is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is simple to avoid it.
My appeal to Clean India is linked to it.
Even if we watch advertising on television, our focus is not on them.
Although advertisements are being made in newspapers, our minds are not paid in them.
Awareness is being created among the people on the small issues of household cleanliness and methods of safe drinking water
However, we dont care about it, we live in good houses, there are a lot of facilities in it but sometimes we dont know that water is stagnant around us.
I urge you not to spread the cottage so simple for death.
Life is very valuable.
The calls for death are a lack of focus on water stagnation and a boycott of cleanliness, and this is not true.
Around 514 dengue fever detection centres have been set up across the country, where free check-ups are being conducted.
Timely diagnosis and treatment is a life-saving factor.
Your cooperation in this regard is very important.
Festivals and festivals will be filled in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali.
Why shouldn't we link all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will become a habit, will they
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy message with you.
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
In the minds of Mahendra Mahajan, the interests of the tribal people of our country are enormous.
These two brothers have made India proud.
This year, these two brothers have won the race and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But in all these efforts, they are keeping in mind the interests of team India and vision for tribals.
Look how everybody is contributing to the progress of the country.
When one hears about such events, he feels proud.
Sometimes because of our perspective, we commit grave injustice to our younger generation.
And I believe that the older generation has had an idea that the new generation does not know anything and this trend has been there for centuries.
But my experience is different from the younger generation.
Sometimes, while talking to the youth, we can also learn many things.
I have met a number of youngsters who have decided to ride a bicycle on Sunday.
Some people are observing that one day I will ride on a cycle day a week.
They say that by this I get good health, good environment and happiness from youth.
Nowadays cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are several others who encourage cycling.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
Just as the achievements of two youths of India have made the country proud, the perspective of the youth of the country is remarkable.
The building of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial in the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been dragging for a long time.
The memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which is going to London by the Indians around the world, will also be an inspiration.
My heartfelt congratulations and appreciation to the State Government of Maharashtra for the efforts to build these two memorials that will bring pride to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes and thanks a lot to you.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor need pulses and a little bit of consumption in porridge.
I am glad that pulses have seen an increase of 50 in the current year and about 33 increase in oilseeds.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to my farmer brothers regarding this thing.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been celebrated as the day of victory in the Kargil war in the history of our country.
The Kargil war did not take place on the borders, but every village and city of India contributed to it.
On July 26th, I consider it a matter of great importance.
In just a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we launched the MyGov portal on 26th July.
I am glad that nearly 2 crore people have gone to MyGov portal and about 5. 12 lakh people have shown their views on it after the formation of the government has completed one year.
It is a matter of great pleasure that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions on PMO application and have spent their golden time for this purpose and have laid down their thoughts in it.
They have given very beautiful suggestions.
However, the people present in this regard have not yet received any attention but brother Akhilesh Vajpayee ji's suggestion has been taken care of by the government and today we have implemented it.
Today, for any scheme of the government, logo, tag lines are being set up, projects are being set up, policies are being formulated and most positive suggestions are being received on the MyGov portal.
Now, my suggestions have also begun in myGov address on the 15th of August as to what I should talk about.
Susitra Vaishari from Chennai has given me a lot of suggestions.
He urged them to talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Clean Ganga and Swachh Bharat.
This is an idea in my mind and this time on 15th August you can record your comments on what I should talk about
Mygov can be sent to the address, write to the radio and send it to the Prime Minister's office.
It is a great idea that I should get from the public what should be included in my speech on 15th August.
I believe that you will definitely give me the best ideas.
Two days ago, my thoughts went on an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the life of a person travelling in a scooter split for ten minutes.
He received no help.
People have been asking me on many occasions that you should talk about road safety and create awareness.
It's all right about you all.
If we ignore the statistics, the heart will stop.
There is an accident happening every minute in our country.
I urge the parents to create an ecosystem in the family wherever the child driven vehicle, 2-wheeler, 4-wheeler, all the safety related aspects are to be followed.
The government has also taken several initiatives in this regard - be it awareness regarding road safety, road construction engineering, law enforcement or emergency treatment for the injured - we have brought the Road Transport and Safety Bill in mind.
In the coming days, we are planning to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Agenda.
We are emphasizing upon cashless treatment on national highways like Gudgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi.
Accordingly, we have been thinking about how to make a special life-saving activity and maintenance within the first 50 hours by keeping an end to the issues related to money suppliers, whether money or not.
First of all, from the point of view of how accidents do not take place, we have to approach it and in fact every life is worth the price.
Sometimes I have been saying that the workers should be Karma Yogis.
I share with you some of the events that have touched my mind in the last few days.
One gets a good feeling to see how one can bring life even in the work they do.
Vijay Biswal ji has shown how his country, art and efficiency can be connected to his work.
I believe that the picture of Vijay Biswal will be a thing to speak in the coming days.
It is my heartfelt desire that a big team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is working with me.
Sometimes even small things are a matter of great joy and that is why I share them with you.
There is a village named Geshla in Rajnandka of Chhattisgarh state .
Over the last few months, they have started a campaign to construct toilets.
Now no one from that village has to waste natural salts in the open.
Whether it was happening or not, when it was completed, like a big festival, the entire village celebrated it.
The best examples of how values change in social life, how people's outlook changes, how the country's citizens take the country forward.
Povesh Day from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a ministry named DONER was created, that is, the Ministry of Development of North Eastern States.
We cannot decide the interests of the North-Eastern states while sitting in Delhi, can we
Therefore, a team of officials of the Government of India visited the Northeast including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim
This effort will have good results in the coming days.
This is a wonderful effort, an attempt to move from Delhi to far-flung areas and this is what I call ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, it gives me great pleasure to be the success of the Seoul Satellite.
In the last few days, India has launched five UK satellites through its PSLV C28.
This is a great achievement even though this news is not a fascinating one.
Sometimes when we ask the young people of the country what they want after you have grown then one hundred of them will answer that I want to be the scientific majority.
The country's scientific lesson is a matter of concern.
Under this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I have urged the officers of the Government of India to spend one-two hours in a week, and share your experiences with them, and this will definitely help them.
Our villages should get 24 hours of electricity or not
Even though this work is difficult, it has to be accomplished.
Today, even if we have to charge mobile phones, we have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should also be extended to the villages and the poorest of the poor should get the opportunity.
Towards this end, we have launched the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages here and we have to ensure electricity supply to the remotest areas.
Your comments will be useful to me.
Thank you very much
When I said so, I didn't expect such a huge response from you.
Hundreds of thousands of people sent photos through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I have also retweeted some of them that have attracted my views.
If some people did not record photographs of Belum caves in Andhra Pradesh, many people in the country would be unaware of the fact that there are caves.
This is the photo of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We know Rajasthan as an ever-water state, but it is surprising when one sends pictures of Mannal waterfalls from there.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assure you that Yoga has not covered the sun in the world.
The kind of red carpet the world is spreading to Yoga and when you see, no Indian will be proud and proud of it.
And I was filled with the flood of joy with myself and my heart was filled with joy.
While the Sean River and the Eiffel Tower are very proud to the people of France, they have chosen these symbols from the background to practice Yoga.
The New York people learnt the Times square to practice yoga.
Speaking of Australia's Sydney, the scenes of the Abera House are shining immediately.
Australians performed Yoga in front of the Abera House symbol.
Rajpath became Yoga.
A new upsurge, a new feeling, a new zeal and a new zeal has been felt in all crores of the world.
A few days ago, his family had tweeted a picture of a Vietnamese child practicing Yoga, which was very fascinating and popular all over the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, rural people, urban residents, developed countries and developing countries came together to practice Yoga.
Yoga is indeed a factor in uniting the world.
I don't know how the world of intellectuals ignores and criticizes this event.
But it is a matter of pride for every Indian that I feel that the world is very keen to know about India.
An interest in India has increased and the world is keen to know about Indias values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the honour and pride of our heritage then we can make the world realise that.
Sometimes we think of what is innovation in it, for example our family values, we dont know that the family values of India are immense for the people of the world.
I appeal to the youth of the country, especially to the youth of the IT sector. You all, as youngsters, collectively make a programme for online yoga.
Do you know that there is a sector called AYUSH in the government
Nobody's attention will be returned to it.
It will be reported 2 or 4 times in five years, a small area in one corner.
But it was during Yoga Day.
This very small sector has done a great job globally.
This is an example of how massive tasks can be accomplished by even smaller institutions while the target is before us.
The world was surprised to see how we had rescued the victims of Yemen.
In a few hours, the world saw that Indians had rushed to Nepal and extended their help.
If we start working with commitment then the government and the government employees will work fast and the common man will be able to celebrate with his head upstairs.
This is my own experience.
This is the real force of progressing the country.
Last month we announced three life insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been engaged in life insurance schemes in some way but we have to take it forward.
An idea arises in my mind, and I want to put it before you.
In August, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is coming, let the people of the country start a powerful mass movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Come, let us all join me and try to fulfil this song.
Many people give me suggestions when I shout Mann Ki Baat.
This time many people have given me suggestions that I should inform you about the monsoon.
Thiruvakars, Yogesh Dhandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Dinakarni and Divyaanshu Gupta have been asking you to talk to your mind about the monsoon.
They have also given good ideas to their part.
You too may be enjoying the joy of having hot pakora, bajji and corn flour tea during this rainy season.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, rain also gives us energy.
Every drop of rain is valuable.
As a citizen and as a society, we must develop a sense of securing every drop of water.
The water in the village should remain in the village as well as the water in the city should be used for urban consumption.
Whether it is vaccines or water management or small ponds or lakes, we should protect every drop of water.
If you have to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhi Ji, then you can see his house and you can see a pole on the ground storing water within his 200 years old house where there is direct facility of rain water.
You must see this.
Even at that time, this kind of interest has been taken.
We can do this too
This should be a peoples movement.
Villages should be followed everywhere.
Similarly, the green robs our eyes.
Green life is so charming
Trees, plantations, gardens and parks make life green, don't they
We all need to implement this movement and plantation of trees during this rainy season on a massive scale through social organisations and youth.
I give you a suggestion from my own experience, this rural technology is a very successful one.
When you plant, you leave an old clay stubble near the plant and fill it with water.
Health is essential because micro-organisms are growing bulk due to moisture in the environment.
Cleanliness is very important.
Drinking clean water is essential.
Most people boil water in this season.
This also has good results.
The more we take care of, the more we get protection from diseases.
Water is needed, rain is also important, but diseases are also very important.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
Under the AMRIT scheme, we have set up a mission to make our cities live-friendly.
By 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence, every Indian should be given a house.
Keeping these three things in mind, we have launched a massive scheme.
This inspired all the fathers to take selfie photographs with their daughters and register on social websites.
In Haryana, the percentage of female children is very low as compared to males.
There are 100 districts of this kind of concern in the country.
This is very high in Haryana.
In some way, we have converted the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao into a mass movement.
Keep in mind how much happiness you will feel, how much pride, honour and the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao will provide
Please leave the rainy season very well
Make our country green
I am experiencing this.
Please take this forward.
I will meet you the next time for Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes people think that I should inform you about the welfare schemes of the government in Mann Ki Baat.
This is what makes me happy.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this interim period would have passed.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 a.m., the feeling that something is gone, I feel that it is myself
But I thought what emerged at that time - no, it should be a program on Sunday.
But I was eagerly waiting for this Sunday.
Several people have asked me why I had travelled to Kedarnath in the midst of the electoral frenzy.
But if I start travelling in that direction then we can change the way Mann Ki Baat is going.
That's why, when the polling was still going on, the predictions of electoral frustration and victory defeats continued.
Many consider it a political content.
For me, I consider it an opportunity to meet me.
In a way, I think I went to meet myself.
I can't tell you when to do it, but I'll do it, because it's my duty to tell you what you want to know.
Just like people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedar, in your words I constantly feel that you are trying to strengthen positive things.
The inputs in Mann Ki Baat's letters seem to be quite different from the usual governmental agenda.
Perhaps your words are also opening the gap between my thoughts and movements.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his concern against hygiene and collaborates in the cleanliness drive.
If one discusses the environment, it reflects his anguish
But at the same time, he also speaks of his efforts and describes his thoughts.
That is, in a way, a scenario of how the solution to the problems can be comprised of the society as a whole will be reflected in his words.
Mann Ki Baat serves as a mirror to the nation and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of determination, energy and capacity in the deepest of the countrymen.
It is necessary to integrate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities and engage in positive efforts.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that 130 crore Indians want to join hands in a strong and constructive way in the progress of the country.
One person writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you can imagine that he has not submitted any application for himself...
How excellent the feelings of millions of such people of the country
I leave you to imagine how much fun I am, how much enthusiasm I am.
You are driving me yourself, you are acting swiftly on me. You cannot imagine that you are nurturing me every moment.
I was waiting without this relationship.
Today my heart is filled with happiness.
Please come forward with this feeling. Let us carry forward the episode of Mann Ki Baat with joy.
At the time of an emergency in the country, the struggles against it are not limited to political limitations and political leaders.
It has not been imprisoned even in the midst of prison wires.
Every citizen was angry with his mind.
There was a vibration for lost democracy.
Every day we eat unhealthy food and we do not know what hunger is.
Likewise, whenever one comes to know of the joy of providing democratic rights in a routine life, one takes away our democratic rights.
During the period of emergency, every citizen throughout the country felt that something was snatched off.
I can proudly say that India is a living society because of this tradition.
This is the reason why the people of the country realized that there was no democracy and we experienced this absence in an emergency.
Therefore, the country dedicated not just for itself, but for the protection of democracy, but for the welfare of the entire election.
We underestimate its significance and ignore its miracles when things or things are far away from our jacket.
More than 61 crore voters have cast their vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
This number may seem simple to us, but if we look at China from the point of view of the world, more than the population of any country in the world have voted in this election.
The number of electors who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was almost double the total population of the United States, which is more than the population of Europe as a whole.
This reflects the vastness and vastness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election is the largest democratic election in the world in history so far.
You can imagine how massive amounts of goods and human resources are required to manage such a massive election.
This has become possible as a result of the hard work done by hundreds of thousands of teachers, officers and staff overnight.
Because of the hard work of all these people, this time more voting has been held than the last time.
In order to vote, around 10 million polling stations, more than 40 million polling machines and more than 17 million webweight equipment...
I leave the uniqueness of arrangements to your imagination.
All these were carried out to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was set up for only one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that it took two days for election officials to reach there.
This is the true respect given to democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is located in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15000 feet at Lahaul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is one more matter of pride for this election.
This is also the first time in history that women participated with enthusiasm in the referendum equal to men.
In this election, the percentage of voting for women and men was almost equal.
One more encouraging thing is that the number of women members in the House today is 78.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard you say that Book is not Book.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers at times of receptions and honors.
Since then people have started publishing books in many places.
Now someone has given me a book titled Bremchand ji's famous stories and I like it very much.
We have not had time for several days, but due to travel abroad we have got the opportunity to re-read some of his stories.
Breamchand describes the realities of society in his stories and while reading these scenes start immigrating in your mind as paintings.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
The second film touched the depths of my mind and its name was Idkah.
A young man's compassionate understanding, his love for his grandson, his madness at such a young age.
The 4-5-year-old Hameeth Festival takes a bread trouser and comes to his grandmother, truly touches the top of human emotion.
Likewise, the name of a renowned version is 'Pus Kee Rath'.
The story illustrates an illusion in the lives of a poor farmer.
If a farmer named Haldu is happy even after his harvest has been destroyed, he does not need to sleep in his field in the cold winter.
But though these stories were written about a century ago, we can realise that these stories are still relevant today.
After reading these things, I realized a unique experience.
I was reading in some media about the Akshara Library in Kerala.
Sometimes they even tied books in their backs and carried them on their backs.
Today, this library is showing a new direction not only to the tribal children but also to everyone.
Gujarat's Vanje Gujarat movement is a successful attempt.
All age groups participated in this book-reading movement.
I would like to urge you people to spend some time in the digital world, in the age of Google Guru, in the middle of your daily routine, to provide a place for books.
In fact, you will be very fond of it and write the book you read and the NarenderModi app so that the voice bearers of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know that our countrymen think about things that can become challenges in the future, instead of hindering them from the present.
When I was reading these ideas on the NarendraModi App and Mygov, I was able to hear a lot about water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai from Belgaum and Sidhamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and others have written about the challenges related to water.
Water has great significance in our culture.
In the absurdity of Rig Veda, water is said to be: Abohista Mayobua: Sthan Urje Dattathana, Maheranaya Sakshase, Yova: Sivadhamorasa: Dasya Bajayadehna: Ushtiriva Matar : , , i.e., water is the surviving power and energy.
Water is equivalent to the mother that motherhood will bless her blessings and will shower her compassion on us.
Water shortage affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received through the rains throughout the year can be stored in our country.
It's just 8.
Therefore, the time has come for a solution to this problem.
I am confident that, like other problems, if we open the 130 crore countrymen with the help of peoples participation and peoples power, I am confident that this difficulty can be solved by collaboration and dedication.
A new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will ensure speedy decision making on all matters related to water.
A few days ago, I had to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Panchayati Raj leaders and the village leaders of the country.
I had written a letter to them that they should collect water, collect water, maintain every drop of rain water and join the villagers in consultation with them.
It gives me immense pleasure that they have been engaged in this work and on 22nd of this month, crores of people participated in thousands of Panchayats.
Every villager was determined to save every drop of water and shared their hard work.
Today, on Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about the leader of a Panchayat.
The people of that place are once again ready to make a positive contribution towards water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat Chairmen and all the Village Leaders who have worked constructively from my side.
There are several leaders across the country who have taken up the challenge of water conservation.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
I have a feeling that the villagers are now engaged in a competition to raise a temple for water in their village.
As I have said, positive results are achieved through social efforts.
There is no single way to confront water crisis across the country.
Efforts are being made in different ways in different parts of the country for this.
But the goal of everyone is one, it is water conservation and water maintenance.
The sewerage networks of Punjab are being repaired.
This effort will get rid of the problem of blockages.
The lives of the villagers are being changed due to the installation of water ponds at Dimyyapalli in Telangana.
A major change has been brought about due to the small ponds being built in the fields of Kabirdam in Rajasthan.
While I was studying about a social effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I learnt that 20000 women had gathered there to revive the Naga river.
At the same time, I also learnt about the women of Garhwal, who worked in harmony with each other in the field of rainwater harvesting.
When people gather, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I present three requests to the people of the country.
My first appeal - just as the countrymen converted cleanliness into a peoples movement, let us begin to convert water conservation into a peoples movement.
Together we will take a pledge to save every drop of water and it is my belief that water is a gift from God, it will bring a miracle to Rasmani.
It was said that this Rasamani battalion would make iron gold.
But you are also such a rasmani that new lives are produced due to water sprinkling.
We have to create a campaign to save every drop of water.
My second application to the countrymen, See, there have been several traditional methods of water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods with all of you.
If any of you got the opportunity to go to Porbandar, the place of birth of a sacred brother, there is a 200-year-old water conservation hall in a house behind his brother's house.
Come, let us inspire people to join in water conservation by setting up a complete list of water conservation.
All of you share your views on JanShakti4JalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world on one more thing.
Presidents of many countries, Prime Ministers, eminent people, ordinary citizens of the world showed me through Twitter how Yoga is being practiced in every country.
On that day, the world was a happy family.
Yoga ensures that we know that there is a need for healthy and understanding individuals to set up a healthy society.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great work of social service.
Shouldn't we be honored for such a service
In 2019, the announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution towards the promotion and development of Yoga has given me an unprecedented inspiration.
The awards are given to organisations that have made significant contribution to spread Yoga across the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan is conducting several institutes and training courses there
Likewise, the Italian Ms.
He is an example of conception.
When it comes to Yoga, please tell us whether India will lag behind
Yoga should be celebrated widely, it should be honoured for those who bring the message of Yoga to every household.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has started today, new feelings, new feelings, new determination and new openings.
Yes, wait for your suggestions and views as usual.
Let us meet and interact frequently.
I listen to your feelings, collect and understand.
Maybe I'm trying to live up to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my ideas and you are my power.
Let us come together and enjoy Mann Ki Baat and fulfil our duties in life.
Once again, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Many-many thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My heart is full of dreams today when Mann Ki Baat starts speaking.
Ten days ago, Mother India has lost her brave sons.
These valiant soldiers have lost their lives to protect our 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave sons had dedicated themselves day and night so that the countrymen could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of our heroic soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack, the hearts of our countrymen are wounded and angry.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families from all four sides have been stirred up.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country who have dedicated their lives and have saved the Mother India.
The task of facing this challenge before the nation should be forgotten by all the differences of casteism, communalism and regionalism so that our endeavours and decisions against terrorism can be firmly and firmly resolved.
Our Armed Forces have always shown uncomfortable courage and might to none.
On the one hand, they showed their extraordinary ability to maintain peace, while reacting to the attackers in the same language as they can.
You can see what kind of operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The military is determined to throw Kelly at the root of extremists and their subsidiaries.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring words and thoughts expressed by their relatives through the media have been widened and strengthened throughout the country.
Meena, wife of Satyagi Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, commends her unlimited adventure throughout the country.
He acknowledged that he would join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena, who was killed by the Tricolour flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his fianc son said he would join the army.
Today, the ambition of this pigeon is growing in the body of every child of India, within the swoon and in the lives of every child.
Whether it is the family of Vijay Maurya, the martyr of Deoria, the father of Thilakraj of Kangda or Balakanattu, the six-year-old sacrifice of Hemraj from Koda - the story of every family of martyrs, the spring of inspiration, the thread of the heart.
I urge the younger communities to know, understand and understand the feelings that these families have shown, the goals that they are targeting.
In order to know all about patriotism, sacrifice and penance, we do not need to reflect the past editions of history.
My dear countrymen, my creatures...
For such a long time since independence, the time of waiting for the war memorial that we all waited for is going to be fulfilled.
It is natural for the countrymen to be enthusiastic about this thing.
Shri Onkar Shetty from Udupi, Karnataka, expressed her happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial at the NarendraModiApp.
It is surprising and sad that no National War Memorial has been established in our country so far.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated with the heroic stories of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I am sure that such a memorial should be established in the country.
The second wheel, the symbolic wheel of valour, demonstrates the courage and valour of the soldiers.
The walls of the exhibition are engraved by the heroic adventures of the soldiers.
Subsequently, the Sacrifice Chakra
This wheel reflects the sacrifices of the soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for the nation will be engraved in the golden signatures.
The Raksha Chakra then symbolizes safety.
There is a queue of dense trees on this wheel.
It is impossible for our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary Forces to play a vital role in the progress of the country.
In October last year, I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial is an expression of the feeling that we should be grateful to the men and women of our police forces who have been safe all the time.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit those places, you must share the photographs that you have taken there on the social website so that others will be inspired to visit these holy places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of your letters and comments come to me in different ways for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was reading your comments, an interesting commentary of Adish Mukobadya ji attracted my attention.
When the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900, his age was only 25.
Similarly, the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata on March 3 is also an accident.
He added that while the two men are entirely from two separate family backgrounds, both of them have accomplished the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is equal to acknowledging the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great men have laid light not only in the name of Jharkhand but also in the name of the whole country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
If a man of inspiration is needed today to guide our youth, then he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British captured him while he was asleep in bitterness and healing.
Do you know why they have taken such an evil
Because even the Britishers who established such a magnificent empire feared him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda, with his traditional arrows, shook the British regime using guns.
In fact, if there is a leadership that gives people a sense of fertility, the society's mentality becomes greater than the power of weapons.
He took the deceitful and cruel men from dark life to the sun to shine.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda was martyred at the end of his 25 years of life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have appeared in all parts of the country.
There were such great men everywhere who could not be seen in India as a part of centuries of freedom struggle.
Unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, suram and sacrifice did not reach new generations.
If people like Bhagwan Birsa Munda have made us realize our existence then people like Jamsetji Tata have given great institutions to the country.
In fact, Jamshedji Tata ji was a visionary prophet, who not only saw the future of India but also laid the foundation for it.
He was very well aware of the need for the future to make India an architect of science, technology and industry.
It is because of his vision that the Tata Institute of Science was established and now it is known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he also established many reliable institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
The Indian Institute of Science was born as a result of this interaction.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai is 29th February.
You all are aware that this day will come only once in four years.
Morarji Bhai was one of the most regulatory leaders of the country.
It was Morarji Bhai Desai, who presented the highest budget report in the Parliament of Independent India.
Morarjibai Desai was capable of leading India at a very difficult time. During that period, the country's democratic system was in great threat.
Morarji Bhai Desai dedicated himself to the emergency to defend democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price at his old age.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janatha Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
It was during his tenure that the 44th constitutional amendment was passed.
Why is it important that the 42nd Constitutional Amendment was introduced in order to provoke an emergency, in which, apart from slashing the powers of the Supreme Court, some other provisions in it have shattered our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
That is, the provisions of the 44th Constitution Amendment empowering the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies to print in newspapers.
For the first time, the proclamation of the Presidential Emergency was made on the recommendation of the Cabinet in writing and the duration of the Emergency cannot be increased by more than six months in a manner.
Morarji Bhai ji ensured that the state of emergency was declared and democracy was slaughtered and buried in 1975, so that it could not be resumed.
His contribution to the preservation of the dignity of Indian democracy is enormous and the future generations will remember it forever.
Once again I offer my condolences to such a great leader.
They are making a positive difference in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their labour.
Inside, they are genuine workers who do the service of the people, social service and above all the service of the country selflessly.
When the Padma awards are announced, you might have seen the people asking who is the award winner.
In a way, I consider this as a great success because these people will not be seen in the television and newspaper cards, who are away from the futile world.
However, those people who don't care about their names are those who believe in getting down to the ground.
Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam is a musical instrument.
I would like to share with you some of these people.
You must be aware of Odisha's talented Nayak, and there is no reason to call him Canalman of Odisha, and Tathari Nayak ji cut the hill in his village and set up a three kilometre canal.
I reminded former US President Barack Obama of the Tree of Life painting that was made by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awardees, Shapier Saiyat from Maratwada is known as Pasutha's servant.
How he dedicated his entire life to the service of cows is very impossible and amazing.
For the first time, Chinnapilla from Madurai, through the Tamil Nadu Reservoir Mission, launched socially oriented micro-financing initiatives for the oppressed and oppressed.
Even after a hundred years, he has taught Yoga to people all over the world and has so far made 1500 people Yoga practitioners.
Jamuna Tudu, a well-known woman named Lady Tarzan, Jharkhand, has done an adventurous job of opposing wood robbers and naxals, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares of jungles and inspiring tens of thousands of women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is because of the untiring efforts of the people of the village today that every child is born 18 trees and 10 trees are planted during the marriage of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, is very encouraging.
Nowadays whenever I go anywhere in the country, I try to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana i. e.
Brothers and sisters, in the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted from this scheme.
I can clearly see how a big change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My dear countrymen who are sitting in my mind, exams will start in schools.
Various Boards of Education across the country will start the Board of Examinations for Classes Twelfth in the next few weeks.
On my behalf, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who will be appearing for the examination.
A few days ago, Pariksha Pe Charcha, a major event on examinations was held in the Town Hall in Delhi.
One of the highlights of the Dialogue on Examinations is that discussions are being held without any hindrance on various issues related to examinations.
Because we have thousands of years of ancient culture and tradition.
A few days later, the holy day of Mahashivaratri is about to come, and this time when Shivratri comes on Mondays, a special significance spreads a sweet smell in our hearts.
A few days back I had gone to Kashi and had got the opportunity to spend some time with some disabled brothers and sisters there.
It was possible to talk to them about things, their self-confidence was really impressive and inspiring.
While speaking, a young blind person with visual disabilities said that he was a platform architect and when he introduced himself as a mixer in the curiosity programme, I asked him who would speak.
He said that he would mix and talk like the Prime Minister.
Immediately, when I did some work, I waited for a surprising surprise, just like I spoke in Mann Ki Baat, he also spoke and showed Mann Ki Baat through Mimikri.
I was glad to know that people are not only listening to Mann Ki Baat but also remembering Mann Ki Baat on several occasions.
In fact, I was very surprised to see the power of these youth with disabilities and they had a major impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you through Mann Ki Baat has provided me a unique experience.
I have been interacting with crores of families every month through Radio.
My heart is filled with the feeling that whenever you talk to you several times, when you read letters and when you hear your phone calls, you consider me to be a member of your family.
This feeling fills my heart with a comfortable experience, enjoys happiness.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we will all be in the fray for elections.
I myself stand as a candidate in this election.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be held on Sunday, the last Sunday of May, to honour healthy democratic traditions.
That is, in March-April, I will begin the series of Mann Ki Baat with a new hope after the elections, with the strength of your blessings and with the support of Mann Ki Baat and I will travel together for several years with your Mann Ki Baat.
Once again I express my gratitude.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumaraswami is supposed to follow this philosophy.
In his 111 years of life, he served thousands of people for social, education and economic development.
If his panditism was so widespread, he had immense knowledge in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He is a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in providing food, shelter, education and spiritual enlightenment to the people.
Swami ji had been the main aim of his life to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Siddhaganga Math is organising regular cow and agricultural festivals.
I have often received the blessings of a sacred Swamiji.
During the centenary celebrations of Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji in 2007, our former President, Dr A.
Kalam Aiya read a poem written for the sacred Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Ayya describes the life and goals of Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji in a beautiful way.
There is a system of great importance in our country
This is a part of our democracy and a part of our democracy is more than our democracy. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
We celebrate 25th January as the founding day of the Election Commission of India, as the National Voters Day.
Looking at the level of elections in India, the world is surprisingly putting its finger on the nose
In Himachal Pradesh, polling stations are being set up at an altitude of 15000 feet and polling stations are also set up at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the Gir forest area, a polling booth has been set up for only one voter at a remote location.
Imagine, my friends...
In order to get the opportunity to use that voter's right to vote, the entire team of ECI personnel goes to far-flung areas to vote - this is the beauty of our democracy.
I would like to heartily appreciate the Election Commission of Indias continued efforts to strengthen the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the States, all the Defence Forces and other personnel who have been free and discriminatory in the election process.
Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in our country this year
Young people born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections this time.
They will get the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the nation on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be partners in the resolution process for the nation.
The time has come to connect their dreams with the dreams of the country.
If you are eligible to vote, you must register your name on the electoral roll.
And if we cannot vote for any reason in life then we must realise that it is sad for us.
If we say that there is a mistake somewhere in the country then we should feel sad.
This activity has to be changed naturally.
I urge all the celebrities of the country to take up a movement and create awareness this time so that all of us together become voters and vote on the day of polling.
I am sure that the younger generation will register their names in such large numbers and they will make their contribution better for our democracy and further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, many times great men have appeared on this great land of India, such great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, we celebrated his birth anniversary in a new way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had a great privilege to unveil a museum dedicated to the heroes of our country's freedom struggle.
Inside the Red Fort, many such rooms and memorials have been shut up since independence.
The closed Red Fort rooms have been transformed into museums dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army, Yaad-e-Jallian
The museum established in 1857 in the memory of India's first war of Independence has dedicated this entire complex to the memory of the Kranti Mandir, the Revolutionary Temple.
Every brickball in these museums smells the fragrance of our glorious history.
It was here that the British government prosecuted Bharat Mata's brave sons Colonel Prem Sayal, Colonel Gurpaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
While I was observing the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of the Red Fort, one of Netajis family gifted me a very special hat.
Indeed, there is a need to bring back the heroes and patriotism of our heroes to our new generations again and again in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
I got the opportunity to hoist the Tricolour at a place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had hoisted the Tricolour 75 years ago.
At this juncture, the announcement regarding the Azad Hind Government was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and capable administrator.
Such a brave soldier has contributed significantly to the freedom struggle.
With the awakening and inspiring slogans like Delhi Shalo, You give me comfort and I give you freedom, Netaji finishes everything from the heart of every Indian.
For years, there was a demand that secret files about him be brought to public.
I am extremely glad that we have done this thing.
I don't really think that Netaji's family had come to my house one day.
Together we talked about several things related to Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
May it be 26 Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum and Kranti Mandir associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today while we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share with you an incident related to the life of Netaji in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connectivity with people.
I have been told that this radio station has been broadcast once a week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
Under this Radio Station, M.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is significant.
The programmes broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and events gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts are being made to illustrate Indian art and culture in a more attractive manner.
There are 4 historical exhibitions in the Museum, where there are more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
The museum showcases the great works of great artists like Amruta Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I especially urge you all to visit and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Well, what is this talking about art, but you can imagine that you go here and talk about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You all know Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev is also a painter.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has given no name to his majority works.
He felt that the person who sees the picture should understand it himself and should look at the news given through the picture from his own perspective.
His paintings are depicted in European countries, in Russia, in the US.
I am confident that you will definitely visit Kranti Mandir and look at his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a sacred land.
Our saints have given messages of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
One such saint is Chand Ravidas.
Ravidas ji was born on 19th February.
In fact, if God lives in all human beings, it is not interesting to distinguish him from caste, religion and creed, he added.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas, through his messages, made efforts to enhance the dignity of labour and labour throughout his life.
It would not be exaggerated if he said that he had given the world the material of the greatness of labour.
Once again I remember the holy Ravidas Ji.
My dear countrymen, in MyGov, Kiran Siddar ji has been asking to speak in Mann Ki Baat about the Indian Space Sector and the dimensions related to its future.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed immensely to Indias space programme.
Our space programme includes the contribution of countless young scientists of the country.
It is heartening to note that the satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are reaching out to the space.
On the 24th of January, our students launched the Kalamsat.
Even sounding rockets produced by university students in Odisha have earned reputation.
All the space missions have been carried out in the last four and a half years since independence in 2014.
We have successfully launched 104 satellites in one spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence in the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 Mission.
Our country has been using space technology in an excellent way to protect the vital components.
Space technology is doing a great job in cyclones, railways and road safety.
NAVIC devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers which protect them and help in economic development.
We have been using space technology in an excellent way to deliver services and deliver responsibilities.
Under the Housing for All scheme, nearly 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been given geo-tagged houses.
Besides, Geo-tack has also made about three and a half crore assets under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Programme.
Our satellites today are symbols of the country's growing power.
Its contribution is that we have made special contacts with many countries of the world.
There is a unique effort in South Asia Satellites, which has rewarded our neighbouring friendly countries for development.
Today, through its specially competitive air services, India is not only a developing country but also a developed countrys satellite.
Sky and crystalline have always been the attraction of children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to think big, to move beyond those boundaries, to see what is so far impossible.
Our children are attracted by cinemas and inspire them to look for new stars, give them a vision.
My dear countrymen, whoever plays and whoever plays, he grows and blossoms, this time the sportspersons who are united in Khelo India are bright.
In January, around 6000 sportspersons participated in 18 Games at Khelo India Youth Games, Pune.
If a local sportsperson performs well then he can achieve excellence globally.
This time, sportspersons from all states showcased their talent in Khelo India.
He lives in a car with his family.
Like him, Captain Sonali Helvey of the Kabaddi Committee of Maharashtra for women under 21 lives in Sathara.
He lost his father at a very young age, and his brother and his mother motivated him to trust Sonali.
We sometimes see that women do not get much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
But beyond all this, he chose Sonali Kabaddi and did a great job.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Azansol, is proud to be the youngest gold medalist in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshada Vaswani Gamdi, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, has won a gold medal in the weightlifting sector.
His father was a farmer from Belgaum.
But did I hear about the competition to shine toilets
More than 50 lakh toilets participated in this wonderful competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
This wonderful contest is called a clean and beautiful toilet.
People used to do marvellous works to keep their toilets clean, beautified and painted, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, so many photographs related to clean and beautiful toilets are available on social platforms.
I urge all the Panchayat Chairmen and the village leaders to lead such a movement in your Panchayat.
Share your clean and beautiful toilet photo with MyIzzatGhar and share it on the social portal.
Friends, together with the aim of cleaning the country and liberating the country from open defecation, we had a commemorative journey on 2nd October 2014.
Due to the cooperation of the people of India, today, 2019, before 2nd October, 2019, we are rapidly moving towards achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF), so that we can dedicate ourselves to him on his 150th birth anniversary.
The contribution of Mann Ki Baat and Mann Ki Baat in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat is immense. That is why I am happy to share this thing with you that more than five and a half lakh villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF).
My little friends, the days of selection are getting closer.
Anshul Sharma, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, has been asking MyGov to talk about exams and exam warriors.
Thank you, Anshuel, for this thing has been put forward.
Yes, the first phase of the year for many families is the exam.
Students, their parents and teachers are all involved in exam related activities.
This time students from many foreign countries will also participate in the event.
I am going to talk to all the angles related to the examinations in this Pariksha Pe Charcha, especially our young friends about the uncompromising choice.
I have been urging people to send inputs and suggestions for this.
I am glad that a large number of people are sharing their views in MyGov.
I will definitely present some of these ideas and suggestions during the Down Hall programme.
You must participate in this programme.
You can also watch the live telecast through the social media and the Namo App.
Let this journey of 2019 progress successfully.
Mann Ki Baat, December, 2018
That is when we get the benefits of experiences and the self-confidence that we have to do something new.
What we do is not only transform our lives but also contribute to taking the country and society forward.
This will be an honour for all of us.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched.
Electricity has been added to every village of the country.
All the valuable organisations of the world have said that India is getting rid of poverty at a record pace.
The countrymen, due to their morale, have increased sanitation coverage to 95.

Our social endeavours have resulted in an unprecedented improvement in the Ease of Doing Business ranking in our country.
A new strength has been given to the country's self-defence.
In this year, our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, that is, our water, land and sky.
Women of the country have honoured the country by trying to circumnavigate the world on a boat called Navika Sagar Parikrama.
In Varanasi, India started its first waterway.
This has led to a new revolution in the waterways sector.

India has successfully awarded the World Cup Cricket Challenge for the Under-19 World Cup and the World Cup for Blind Persons with Visually impaired.
This time, India has won medals in a big way in Asian Games.
India has done excellent work in Para Asian Games.
If I talk about every Indians efforts and our social endeavours only then the voice of Mann Ki Baat will be very long and it will also be born in 2019.
All this has been produced by the constant efforts of 130 crore people.
Jayachandran joined Bhagwadhi.
People say that he was always busy in treating patients.
Similarly, Sulhiti Narasamma from Karnataka joined Bhagwad on December 25th.
Sulhiti Narasamma was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was honored with the Padma Shri award.
While we are talking about healthcare, I also want to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days back, some members of our party told me that some young doctors had organized a camp in the city and provided free treatment to the poor.
Every month several poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends who are engaged in selfless service is truly praiseworthy.
Today I would like to say this thing with great pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement due to social efforts.
A few days ago, I was told that in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people had worked together in the cleanliness drive.
People from all walks of life including municipalities, NGOs, students from schools and colleges, and the people of Jabalpur participated in this Mahabharata of Swachhta.
The success stories of innovative youngsters and entrepreneurs are well described in com.
Well, shall we do a job
Should we share information on such websites with us
Let us spread a positive feeling.
With this, a large number of people will come to know about our heroes who are bringing about changes in society.
There is a special place for sports in all societies.
It fills the hearts of those who watch it while playing.
We feel a lot of things like the name, identity and respect for sportspersons.
But perhaps there are many things in the context of these things that are bigger than the sports world.
I would like to mention Hanay Nisar, a Kashmiri girl who won a gold medal at the Garade Games in Korea.
Hanaya is a 12 year old girl from Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanaya's hard work, hard work, hard work, hard work and hard work, he learnt it very well and made a record.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I wish him a bright future.
Many congratulations and good wishes to Hanaya.
Like him, there was a lot of news in the media about Rajani, a 16-year-old girl, and you must have read.
Rajani has won the Gold in the Under-Girls' Boxing Games.
When Rajani won the medal, she immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani rolled his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, you all wonder why Rajani had a cup of milk, didn't you
He did this in order to pay homage to his father Jasmer Singh, who is selling Luxi at a shop in Panib.
Rajani later said that his father had made a lot of sacrifice to achieve this situation and had tolerated many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
Vedangi Kulkarni, a 20-year-old young lady from Pune this year, became the first Asian lady to quickly turn the world into a bicycle.
He travelled around 300 kms per day for 159 days.
His passion for cycling is truly praiseworthy.
When we hear about such achievements, don't we have a sense of humour
The names of all these festivals may be different but there is a feeling of celebrating everything and these festivals are somehow associated with harvest and harvest, with the farmers, with the villages and with crops.
At this juncture, the time of sunset and sunset enters Rasi.
After that the day gradually begins to grow and the winter crops are being harvested.
My best wishes to our Annamish farmer brothers and sisters.
The joy of the feeling of unity in diversity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat spreads the fragrance through our festivals.
We can see how closely our festivals and rituals have a relationship with nature.
Many of our festivals have been specially nurtured in the spirit of conservation of rivers and water.
Sun worship is performed in rivers and water bodies on the day of Chaturbhuni.
During Makar Sankranti, crores of people take holy dip in the sacred rivers.
Share your photographs during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela has a great dimension, however divine it is, it is filled with glory.
People from all over the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
In Kumbh, people come and mix with faith and zeal.
Millions and millions of people from the country's neighbouring countries join together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is a fun filled song that enjoys our great cultural heritage.
This time, the Kumbh Mela, which is going to be organised at Prayagraj, starting from 15th January, is looking forward to all of you.
Saints and saints have started coming to Kumbh.
We can calculate its special significance by linking the Kumbh of UNESCO last year to the list of CULTURAL HERITAGE OF HUMANITY, the enormous cultural heritage of mankind.
A few days ago, envoys of many countries went on to see the preparations for the Kumbh.
There were flags of many countries flying simultaneously.
There is a possibility of people coming from more than 150 countries to participate in the Kumbh being organized at Prayagraj.
Because of the divinity of the Kumbh, India's glory will showcase its glory in the world arena.
Kumbh Mela is a great instrument for realising oneself and every person who comes here has different experiences, who looks at world affairs spiritually and understands it.
In particular, it provides an opportunity for youngsters to learn as a great learning experience.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I could see the arrangements for Kumbh being done very commendable.
The people of Prayagraj are seen with great enthusiasm for the Kumbh Mela.
There I dedicated the Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people, the Integrated Command and Control Centre.
Cleanliness along with difficulty in arrangements will also reach the remotest areas.
This time devotees can also perform the holy sight of Akshayvat after a holy dip in the Sangam.
This Akshayvat, a symbol of people's faith, had remained in the fort for thousands of years so that the devotees could not see it even if they wanted it.
Now the doors of Akshaya Vadam have been opened to all.
May this spiritual Kumbh be the glory of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of hope be the glory of the nation.
Be it the glory of national unity or be it the glory of the devotees or be it the glory of the world tourists.
Sadly, Babu had an unparalleled connection with South Africa.
It was in South Africa that Mohan and Mahatma were present.
In South Africa, Gandhiji began his first Satyagraha and made a solemn pledge against discrimination.
He established Fenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where voices of peace and justice began to sound all over the world.
He had the patience and inspiration to spend years in prison from a sacred brother.
Mandela ji was an inseparable part of our history, so he did his first experiment with desperate devotion.
Here he clearly expressed his commitment to justice
This is where he unfolded his Satyagraha philosophy and the way of struggle.
He set the brother as his model.
Brothers and sisters, Mandela has been a source of inspiration for the world and their goals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a conference of Director General of Police at Kevadiya, on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, where there was an interesting discussion with the top police officers of the country.
Deliberations were held in detail on how to make efforts to further strengthen the security of the nation and the nation.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was always involved in preserving the unity of India.
Sardar Patel believed that India's strength lies in unity in diversity.
We will be able to pay our homage to Sardar Patel through this award in order to respect this sentiment.
My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, Guru Gobind Singh ji's holy birthday.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For a large part of his life, his work was in north India, and he joined the sovereignty of Maharashtra's Nanded.
The birthplace is Patna, the activities of North India and the last moments of life in Nandedeh.
In a way, it can be said that the whole of India has got his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
But whenever there were attempts to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, whenever there was injustice against them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a loud voice to the poor and the weak and fought shoulder-to-shoulder.
He would say, "Conflicting with the weak, cannot express their power.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that the greatest service is to eradicate the sufferings of humanity.
He was a stalwart of virtue of valour, suram, sacrifice and charity.
Apart from this, he was a master in many languages - Gurumukhi, Braj Basha, Samskrutam, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, many events are taking place in the country which are not discussed much.
The FSSAI is a unique attempt.
Events are being organized throughout the country to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Healthy India Yatra is being undertaken through Eat Right India and the mission of Making India Regular Diet.
India is self-sufficient when it becomes clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important necessity for good health.
Knowledge of the importance of food has been essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the culmination of 2018, let us re-interact in the year 2019 and re-interact with our hearts.
Whether it is individual life or the life of the nation or of the society, the spirit is the source of development.
Come, let us see a new spirit, a new zeal, a new spirit, a new zeal, new heights and new heights - let us move forward, let us see change, let us bring about change in the country.
Mann Ki Baat, November, 2018
On the 3rd of October 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, on the 3rd of October 2014, we all took together a pilgrimage through Mann Ki Baat.
This time most of the letters and phone calls from you have come to the 50th part.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Delhi on Narendra Modi App, Presenjith Sarkar from West Bengal and Sangeeta Sastry from Nagpur have raised a similar question.
Your passion is natural.
In today's era, almost forgotten radio, why does Modi connect through radio
I would like to tell you about one incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working with the Bharatiya Janatha Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in the month of May.
Take a laddu placed in his candy vessel and first eat laddus before preparing for tea.
I wondered why, what was the matter, whether anybody in the house got married.
No, no, brother, do you know
I don't understand.
Look, let's hear the radio first.
Then he was talking about it on the radio.
In this forest, in such a deserted area, in the midst of snowy mountains, a common man sells tea as a volunteer and asks for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, when I was the Prime Minister, I was not surprising at the turning of my attention to the powerful media of radio.
Mann Ki Baat was inspired by the desire to take farmers and young professionals from far-flung villages to cities of the country.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, phone calls were asked, comments were made on the app and MyGov
We have collectively covered the journey of these 50 components, which have been connected with one corner and have been provided with interest.
At present, Agil Indian Radio has also undertaken a study on Mann Ki Baat.
Some of the meetings were very interesting.
Seventy percent of those who have been surveyed are constantly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Overseas considers a positive spirit in society as a major contributor to Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat has inspired mass movements.
There has been widespread discussion on indiapositive.
All these underscore the positive spirit and a positive spirit in the minds of our countrymen.
People are sharing their feelings that the spirit of self-confidence has increased due to Mann Ki Baat.
The idea of social service is a big change in the minds of the people.
But the people did not join this event only through a radio.
Besides TV, FM, Mobile, Internet, Basebook Direct Broadcasting and Periscope, people are also contributing to Mann Ki Baat through the NarendraModi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of Mann Ki Baat for believing in Mann Ki Baat and becoming a part of it.
Your doubts are correct.
At the end of their analysis, this event was also a result of a lack of political orientation.
When Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that Modi should not be seen anywhere, whether it was political or throbbing the government.
Lovers' expectations were evident in letters, communications and telephone calls in front of every Mann Ki Baat.
Modi will come and go but this country will remain sustainable forever and it will not be destroyed by our culture.
Small stories of 130 crore countrymen will remain hidden.
I read the letter and if the same sentiment emerged in another letter, I would like to add it to it.
Besides, I also share my experience with you.
No government can have the capability to spread such widespread awareness and spread awareness across the country and abroad, starting from a small village in Haryana.
When every sector and familiarity of the society comes together, when it is said in a new dimension of social change then today's generation understands it, it creates an unknowing awareness.
India's internal social justice is about social power.
There are thousands of angles of social life, one of which is political.
If politics becomes everything, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes, political events and politicians dominate, so many other talents and other attempts of society are suppressed.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
In a way, you have been asked because of your acceptance.
If I have to answer directly to the question that you have asked, I don't engage in any preparation.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy job for me.
People's letters come in front of every Mann Ki Baat.
The letter is not merely a paper for me.
In fact, I have been living the life of a saint for nearly 40-45 years, I have visited most of the districts of the country and have spent considerable time in the remote districts of the country.
To tell the truth, the voice in Mann Ki Baat is mine, but the examples, the feelings and the feelings are all of my countrymen.
I have not been able to mention the names of lakhs of such people in Mann Ki Baat to this day, but they are sending their letters and their comments without being disillusioned.
I have full confidence that your ideas will contribute to making your thoughts more attractive and more effective than ever before.
Efforts are being made to facilitate the departments related to the letters and comments that have not been received in Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends on All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social websites.
Thus, they are transforming into Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to all of them for their skills and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this programme in your regional languages.
No politicalist will ever have the pleasure of the media, the very low coverage is available and that too is negative.
But the media switched over the various topics raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, road safety, intoxicants free India and a selfie with a daughter have been used by the media in innovative ways and they have made it a movement.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat will not be complete.
Financial sir, thank you very much for your phone call.
To tell the truth, I have no secrets.
It makes it easier for everyone to understand until the ancient traditions of our lives do not diminish.
Sometimes we talk about the gap between the elderly and the adult in the family.
In fact, speaking to the majority of adults has diminished.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through exclusive programmes or social websites.
I have always tried to learn from what they do or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I have been giving a lot of importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I believe that there is no time for youngsters to waste, this is what helps today's younger generation to innovate more because they think they can finish things faster.
We are being told that today's youth is more talented and think about big things.
Well, let them see great dreams and achieve great successes.
Some say that the younger generation wants to do things at the same time.
I'm asking, can there be any mistake in this
That is why scientists are doing many things at the same time.
Youngsters who make a big difference in society, be it social entrepreneurship, start-ups or be it sports or be it any other sector.
These youngsters start questioning and are capable of dreaming.
If we place the ideas of the youth on the earth, if we provide an independent environment to shape them then we can bring a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vineeta, from MyGov, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like you to talk about the Constitution Day tomorrow, November 26th.
Why this day is special, he has also recorded that in the 70th year we have adopted our Constitution.
Vinitha ji, thank you very much for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitutional Law Day.
It is a day when we think of the great men who gave us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years, eleven months and 17 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this constitutional task which was drafted by the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these dignitaries have enacted such a vast, profound constitutional law.
The rapid pace with which they enacted the Constitution Act is still an example of time management and productivity.
We are also motivated to complete our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The special feature of our Constitution is that it describes in detail the rights and duties.
It is a memorable event to enhance the awareness of the Constitution among the youth and to link them with the various dimensions of the Constitution.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years of our journey and we will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us take forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you must never forget the contributions of that great man who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
He's the gentleman who's the gentleman.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
It is on the 6th of December that he became Mahaparinirvana day i. e.
I pay my homage to Baba Saheb on behalf of all my countrymen and he has got the right to live with dignity in crores of Indians.
Democracy is a natural blend of Baba Saheb and Indias democratic values are not imported from outside, he said.
What is democracy, what is the parliamentary system is not new to India.
My devotional tributes are to Baba Saheb again.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on November 23, Guru Nanak Dev ji's birthday was celebrated and in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of human welfare.
He always demonstrated in society the path of opportunity, service, compassion and brotherhood.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been requested to perform this function very well.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated across the world.
Moreover, Guru Nanak Devji will also be connected with the pilgrimage centres.
Now when I was participating in a meeting related to this, I was reminded of Lakbad Saheb Gurudwara.
The Gurdwara was severely affected by the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But it is still an example that the state government has rebuilt it in collaboration with those regional groups.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the next Mann Ki Baat and today I have got the opportunity to first express the feelings behind Mann Ki Baat for the first time because of the questions that you have raised, but this journey will continue.
The more I join you, the deeper our journey will be, the more joyous it will be.
Some people can ask what I got from Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to tell you today that in Mann Ki Baat, one of these things touches my heart and when all the members of the family sit together and listen to Mann Ki Baat, our family leader sits among us and shares with us about our things.
Your comforts, my cleansing.
Your expectations and my expectations.
Your desires are aspirations, my desires are aspirations.
Come, let us take this journey further.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
October 31 is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the 'Run for Unity' programme.
Currently, the climate is tight.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in the Unity Run.
About six months prior to independence, the world famous international newspaper Time was published on January 27, 1947 with the photograph of Sardar Patel on its first page.
Indias map was also published in the newspapers headlines
But the map doesn't look like it's now.
The map showcased India as a piece.
It consisted of more than 550 princely states.
When they left the country, they had the intention of breaking India into pieces.
The Times commented that India was facing various threats such as partition, violence, food shortages, price rises and power politics.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had said that it was Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel who could integrate the country and heal the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article also pointed out the other side of the biography of India's iron man.
The article included his handling of relief operations during the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920 and his conduct of the Bardoli Satyagraha.
His sincerity and commitment were so great that he could put his full faith in the farmers, workers and industrialists.
Sardar Patel took every issue in his hand to integrate the country, just like weighing the garb through a single-booked axle.
He ensured that all the princely states of the country are united with India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram, or be it the princely states of Rajasthan, if we can see an integrated India we can see, it is because of Sardar Patel's foresightedness and vision.
Constructed on the banks of the Narmada river of Gujarat, this statue is double the size of an independent statue of the United States.
This will be the world's highest statue of skies.
Every Indian is proud of the fact that the worlds tallest statue is being built in India.
Sardar Patel, the true son of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I am confident that this statue, which has made the Mother of India, will make every Indian proud.
Because it is natural for every Indian to have the desire to see the statue of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a destination for the people across the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, we all celebrated Kaladapada Diwas yesterday.
I salute every member of the Indian Defence Forces.
I salute the families of our soldiers.
You must be aware of the reason why we are celebrating this day as a Baltistan Day.
Indian troops shook off Kashmir this day and saved the valley in the grip of the occupation.
This incident is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview of our respected army officer Sham Maneksha.
Field Marshal Shaam Manekshaw recalled his career as a colonel.
It was at that time that military operations began in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw mentioned how Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had reprimanded Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for delaying the deployment of troops to Kashmir, noting that there should be no delay in deployment of troops, and Sardar Patel had given him a clear instruction to resolve the issue quickly.
And if our armies flew to Kashmir then we can understand how our army worked successfully.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will address the commemoration of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, on October 31.
Let us pay our respects to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who would not be a sports lover
If the youngsters of our country have these qualifications then our country will not only grow in the field of economics and scientific technology but will also grow in the field of sports.
I am delighted to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and their determination to break the barriers and win the victory will inspire all the people of our country.
I also got the opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Youth Olympics in Argentina.
You are aware that the performance of our youth at the 2018 Youth Olympics has been unprecedented.
We have won 13 medals and three medals in the blending dual category.
You must be aware of the excellent performance of Indian sportspersons in the recent Asian Games.
You must have noticed that I have often referred to the word "Manimum or Unprecedented Achievement".
This is a reality that reflects the progress made by Indias sports sector every day.
India is making new achievements not only in sports but also in numerous sectors.
For example, I would like to mention to you the disabled sportsperson Narayan Thakur, who won the Asian Games 2018 for Persons with Disabilities.
He is, in fact, a disabled person.
He lost his father when he was eight.
He then lived at home for eight years without support.
He then left the house and spent his life cleaning the buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and working in roadside restaurants.
It is Narayan who has won medals on behalf of India in international competitions.
Not only this, it should also be noted how fast Indian sports is getting a place of excellence.
Moreover, India has not yet won a medal in the Junior or Senior category.
However, Indias Tapabi Devi won a silver medal at the Youth Olympics.
Tapabi Devi, 16, belongs to a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker and his mother is doing fish business.
It's a time without money even to buy food items.
Even in such poverty, his passion and dedication have not diminished.
He has made history by winning medals for the nation.
The entire world appreciated the successful conduct of the contest.
FIFA has achieved a record number of eyewitnesses in the field of World Cup competition for below 17 years.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football matches in different sports disciplines of the country and have given a big boost to the youngsters.
This year also, we have the opportunity to host the Mens Hockey tournament in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup is scheduled to commence on November 28 and December 16.
Every Indian, who plays any game or who is interested in any sport, will certainly be interested in hockey competition.
In the Hockey Games, India has made records of gold writing.
India has won gold medals at various events and has won the World Championships once.
India has also created a number of excellent hockey players.
Whenever you quote about the hockey game, you cant accomplish it without mentioning our achievements.
Major Dhyan Chand, considered to be the father of Hockey, is famous all over the world.
Further, Indian Hockey has a long tradition from Balbir Singh Senior, Leslie Cladius Mohammad Shahid, Uttam Singh to Dhanrajbilla.
Even now, the soldiers of the Indian team are inspiring the younger generation by their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to watch outstanding competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and inspire every Indian team to play there.
Odisha has an excellent historical background and a rich cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very fond of it.
This is a unique opportunity for sportspersons to see Odisha.
One can also enjoy sports competitions along with the world famous holy places like Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake.
I assure you of my best wishes to the Indian men's team that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams participating in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the mood of those who have come forward to work for the society indeed provides inspiration and enthusiasm to all the citizens of the country.
But in the new era, those who can fulfil their dreams, new generations are resurgent and enthusiastic with innovative methods.
I attended the inauguration ceremony of a new portal titled 'I for Community,' which has been launched by my Government and by the IT and electronics industry of the country to encourage workers to take up social activities and provide them with opportunities to work in this field.
Their dedication and valour will make every Indian proud.
The change that we are not, has created a new ecosystem in the field of IT for working with the society from the individuals to the society.
Some people are teaching lessons to older people
Some are dedicated to cleanliness and some are helping the farmers.
But they are the driving force behind whose actions there is no motivation.
But one who learns to play a basket while sitting in a wheelchair can help a handicapped person with disabilities wearing a wheel chair and a handicapped player.
This feeling and dedication is a systematic functioning.
This will make every Indian proud.
I am not, we will certainly draw all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when we looked at the suggestions made by you people for Mann Ki Baat today, the idea of Shri Manish Mahabharata from Puducherry was extremely encouraging.
Through the Mann Ki Baat App, the tribal people and their traditions and ceremonies have been given examples of how the natural environment is favourable.
How we can imbibe the traditions of tribals in our lives and sustainable development and learn from such traditions, he added.
I compliment you for presenting this issue among the people of Mann Ki Baat.
As the whole world, especially the West, discusses environmental protection and explores new ways of adopting a balanced lifestyle, it will encourage us to understand our past and ancient traditions.
Our country is facing the same problem.
But to find solutions, we must recall our past golden age and understand our traditional riches, especially the way of life of our tribal people.
Accommodation in close cooperation with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters bow down to God for trees, plants and flowers.
The people of Bhil, who live in central India, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are planting trees of Bipal and Arjun.
The Phishnoi classes living in the desert areas of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
In particular, they are prepared to give their lives, rather than affecting a tree.
The Mishmi tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh are friendly with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
LTTEs are also wildlife reserves in Nagaland.
The Warli people of Maharashtra regard the LTTE as their guests, and the LTTE's presence with them reflects their prosperity.
The Tigers of Central India feel that the LTTE is directly related to their lives and if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be starved.
The people of Central India also stopped fishing on the Kaitan River during the 1980s.
Those who regard this area as a fish sanctuary think that nutritious fish will be available in abundance because of their belief.
Besides, the tribals are also setting up their habitats with strong and environment friendly natural products.
Dhodar ethnic people living in some isolated areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of southern India only settle their dwellings with the goods available in the area.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony to the fact that the tribal people believe in living in a very peaceful and harmonious way and if someone tries to harmonise their natural resources then he will not hesitate to fight for their rights.
Its not surprising that many of our freedom fighters are from the tribal communities.
No one can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda, who fought hard against British imperialism to defend their forests.
Besides, I have mentioned so far, a lot of tribal communities that have taught us how to co-ordinate with nature and we are extremely grateful to our tribal people for ensuring that the forests of the country remain consistently forested.
Everyone should come forward to express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, we have mentioned individuals and organisations that have played a vital role in the cause of society in Mann Ki Baat.
However, these tasks are not enough, but they have inspired deepest feelings in our thinking to show a new way to work for the society.
A few days ago, I had read about the farmer brothers of Panchayat, Kurbachan Singh.
The marriage of the hardworking farmer brother Kurbachan Singh's son will take place.
Kurbachan Singh specifically told the bridegroom's parents that the wedding should be conducted smoothly.
There is no need to spend huge amounts on wedding reception or any other matter, he added.
He suggested that this should be regarded as a very simple wealth, and suddenly imposed a condition.
He had laid down the condition that the daughter-in-law would not burn straw and agricultural waste in their fields.
You must think well about the societal strength of this idea.
But it shows how high his quality is and how many families in our society solve their personal problems in a way that benefits the society as a whole.
The family members of Shri Tirunaki Kurbachan Singh have given us such an example.
I also read about the village Kalarmajra near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning steel, the village of Kalarmajra has come to light by the farmers who have adopted new techniques to mix them with soil.
Congratulations to Kurbachan Singh
My congratulations to the people of Kalarmajra village and all those who have not been polluted in their neighbourhood for their special care.
All of you have been a genuine roadmap for carrying forward the Indian tradition of healthy living.
Like the confluence of small drops of water, it is necessary to create a better environment for every creative activity.
My dear countrymen, this is what our ancient scriptures say: 'God, there should be peace around us in all the three worlds, water, wind, land, fire, breath, medicines, plantations, gardens and intense creations.
Every soul within me and within you, every heart and this magnificence must rest in peace.
Om Shanti: Shanti:
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved by gold writings.
For India, November 11 this year is significant because a hundred years ago, the First World War ended on November 11.
It is a hundred years since the end of this war, and it makes us realize that it is a hundred years since the end of catastrophe and human lives.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we don't have a direct connection with the war.
However, our soldiers fought in that war with courage and made great sacrifices.
Indian soldiers have also explained that if there is a war, Indians are not sick.
Our soldiers have shown their courage and bravery in difficult areas and in terrible weather conditions.
The only purpose was to create peace.
This world knows the great deaths and precious things that occurred during the First World War.
It is reported that nearly one crore soldiers and as many innocent people have died.
This is what the whole world realised the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the meaning of peace has changed.
Today, peace is not only a war, but also a global partnership and coordination to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our Northeast states have a special distinction.
The people of Northeast are also very talented in this region.
Now the North-Eastern states have become well-known for their excellent performance.
The North Eastern Region has made great strides in organic farming.
In order to promote sustainable food system, the State of Sikkim received the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 a few days ago.
Besides, Sikkim has also won the award by pushing back the recommendations from 25 countries.
I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing.
I believe that such festivals will prove to be an opportunity to fulfil new promises.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop, this country will also grow.
My best wishes to you all.
