And sometimes, if we look at the pages of history together - India's first war of independence took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which started in 1857, was continued in some corner of the country every moment till 1942.
And in the five years from 1942 to 1947, such a people created a mindset that is achieved through a resolution that successfully became the reason for achieving independence for the country in a decisive year.
These five years were decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this number.
It's been almost 70 years.
I'm sorry.
The voices of 1. 25 billion people of the country resonate from the walls of the Red Fort.
I am glad that I have been receiving suggestions from every corner of the country on the 15th of August for the last three years.
Our families of our poor brothers and sisters do so.

I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen for the upcoming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters are making the country proud and touching new heights of progress be it education sector, economic sector, social sector or sports.

The destiny of the country and the future will definitely be good.

And now it is the festival of Eid.
My best wishes to everyone on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of the month of Ramzan, the month of Dan, the month of joy and happiness will increase as much as I shared happiness.
Let us all collectively take inspiration from this auspicious festival and share the stores of happiness and take the country forward.

In this Ramzan village people decided to construct toilets together.
If our handwriting is bad, then we have to be careful for a long time to improve it.
It is through hard work that changes the habits of body and mind.
The issue of cleanliness is similar.
Then what was the goal
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in the jail.
But for the first time I got the opportunity to join the rainy season.
Our soldiers performed Yoga in Siachen, where the temperature is minus 20, 25, 40 degree Celsius.
Within this, I came to know that the Government of India has started a scheme called Governance E-arketplace.
I tried to know what the bricks were, I asked some people.
They will see what quality is right and what supply is cheaper.
He has to order for supply.
The brokerage will be eliminated and transparency will come.
Therefore, all the government departments who are registered in the E-GE look after it.
On one side I got the money under the Mudra Yojana, my business started - I gave a description of what can I do in E-GE and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
I would certainly like that those who want to sell their products to the government should be more connected with it.

Last time when I had spoken about Mann Ki Baat, I had said one thing specially to the younger generation that they should do something new, come out of the comfort zone and create a new experience.
I couldn't read everything, I couldn't hear everyone's words.
However, whatever I saw in abstract terms, if someone tried to learn music, someone put his hands in a new tube, some people tried to learn new things through YouTube.
Some people have tried to learn new languages, some have started learning kitchens, learning dances, learning dramas.
Some have written that they have started writing poems.
After that you will see a new consciousness within you when you are associated with the natural conditions.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
Today, I am receiving news from the states.
With the arrival of rains in almost all the states, a big plantation drive is underway.

The government itself is taking steps.
We will also contribute to the plantation programme on this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, 21st June has become a famous day all over the world.
The world is celebrating this as World Yoga Day.
From that day onwards, I have travelled to various places in India.

But after this phone call came I also thought it was true.

But after such a long experience, I realize that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not think that this Mann Ki Baat programme has made me a civilisation for every family in India.
Two days ago, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the President, the Vice President, the Speaker, all released a review book on Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you.
I had never thought that especially the youth of our country have been doing this thing for a long time.
We have been aware of the fact that some social organisations have been doing this thing for several years but I came to know that the youth of my country is engaged in this work.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have consistently strived to scale new heights of development.
My best wishes to these two states.
Just a few days ago, Shri Jagat Jagannath Bhai from Gujarat sent me a book Save the Sparrows in which he expressed anxiety due to the decreasing number of household chores and at the same time he explained in a very beautiful way what he had used and tried to preserve them.
This was also done at the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that we forget that we should give the news papers to the consumer, the milk consumer, the postman or any other person who comes to our house in the summer.
However, most of the people come to the comfortable environment and the examination has been done now.
Summer is comfortable even in summer.
But as a friend of yours, I give you some suggestions on how to cut the summer season.
I believe that some of you will use it and I will write letters.
I would like to say three things to use in the summer season if I did not do well, otherwise, it would certainly be useful.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.

In other words, he said, "Sharm is Shiva, I often say "Sharmev Jayate".
Many congratulations and thanks.
In every corner of the country, most of the families will be busy in examining their children.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Rabindranathji is that he was not the first person in Asia to be the Nobel Prize winner in 1913, the British also decorated him in the Knight category and when the British divided him in 1919 at Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath was one of the great personalities and great personalities who demonstrated against the British government and had a deep impact on a twelve-year-old child in this period.
The sight of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre created a new inspiration in the minds of a small child playing in the furnace and in 1919, the 12 year old child Bhagat stands as a source of inspiration for us - Shahid Bhagat Singh.
Three days before today, 23rd March, the British Government had hanged Bhagat Singh and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru in a hurry. And everyone knows that on 23rd March, there was a sense of satisfaction for serving Mother India in the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
He dedicated all the dreams of life to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are our source of inspiration today.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
A good beginning can be made for India.
India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you.
We can do this in our daily lives.

He is feeling sorry to see the dirty waste in that corner.
I remember it as a good sign.
I would like to say this thing that there should be anger against cleanliness in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Once there is anger and dissatisfaction, we will start doing something or the other against filth.
It is good that the singers are spreading their anger, they are advising me and they also say that they have failed in many attempts.
I know some youngsters who are doing this kind of mission.
Even around us, we dont know about such incidents, perhaps we are hesitant to talk openly about them.
The one who feels depression cannot say anything on his own because he feels ashamed.
If he prefers to stay together without being with you, you should not let that happen.
This is the best way.
This will be the third year.
Lakhs of Yoga Festivals should be celebrated.
If you would like to give some suggestions on the 3rd International Yoga Day, please make it through my mobile app and be my guide.

I would like to tell my mothers and sisters one thing because today there is talk of health and health.
Just a few days back, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
Welcome to the work done by women in our country, their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is growing.
But they have a special responsibility.
Earlier, 12 weeks of maternity leave was given to the working women during their pregnancy, now it has been extended to 26 weeks.
There are perhaps two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this direction.
India has taken a very important decision for these sisters.
Narendraodi App, through Twitter, in the letter...
Technology has created a special place for itself in terms of fighting poverty, preventing illness, establishing relations with the world, disseminating knowledge or information.
It is also heartening to note that this is the 38th successive inspiration of PSLV.
This is an important achievement in the defence sector and you will be happy to know that only 4 or 5 countries in the world have this potential.
Two individuals have worked with utmost sincerity and have developed houses that can protect their homes in times of calamity.
In our country, there has been a lot of support for the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'Disin Dhan Vyas Yojana'.
More than four thousand businessmen have received prizes worth Rs. 50,000.
They are understanding and encouraging with great enthusiasm.
Pooja Nemade, a graduate student of Maharashtra, I also express my feelings about how the use of Rupay Card, e-allet etc. is being done in his family and how much happiness he is getting.
And how important a prize of Rs. 1 lakh is for him, but he has now taken up this task as a campaign and is also inspiring others for this work.
I urge the countrymen, particularly the youth of the country, and those who have been awarded the DG-Dhan Vyapar Yojana, to take the leadership of this movement as ambassadors or ambassadors.
In a way, you are the master of the sanctity.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service to the poor of my country.
We are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy, the self-confidence of the country increases.
We have welcomed all the disabled persons of our country who have performed in the Rio Paralympics.

Once again I congratulate all the players of the team.
The country is proud of this achievement of our Divyang friends.
I am extremely grateful for your partnership.
Therefore, when I am talking to you today, my eyes are drawn towards Mohan.
Today, when we talk about festivals, India is preparing for another big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but in the entire world.
Looking at his entire life, we can see that in South Africa, he served the people of that community, who had fallen prey to dilemma and at that time it was not a common thing.
He served those farmers who were being discriminated against in Champaran.
He taught service not in language but in his life.
I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians will have imagination and 130 crore programmes.
This is the Nand Lal Bose whose architectural architecture enhances the glory of our Constitution.

Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to some or the other resolutions from every Indian.
We should do something for the country, for the society and for anyone else.
This will be a good, true and authentic work for Bapu.
Sons of Mother India, you may remember that for the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign throughout the country for nearly two weeks prior to 2nd October.
This time, on 2nd October, when we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic not just open defecation.
Mudhai Pashankhesu is a jewel of jewellery.
This means water, food and sacred gems are three gems on this earth.
But fools call stones gems.
The glory of food is immense in our culture.
Even we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
It is important especially for women and children because they are the foundations of our future in our society.
Under the POSHAN Abhiyaan, nutrition is being converted into a mass movement through modern scientific methods across the country.
People have been struggling against malnutrition in a new and wonderful way.
Once a thing was brought to my notice.
This was a very good step that could be done in all the regions.
Friends, There are small things that can effectively fight malnutrition in our country.
Today poor families and wealthy families are affected due to lack of awareness.
The month of September will be observed as a Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
There was a time when there was a translation and a small Cordles device was put in the ears of Bear Grylls.

I have already told you that you must visit Northeast India once in your life.
On 15th August, I had requested you from the Red Fort to visit at least 15 places in the next three years.
Last month, I had the opportunity to release the Tiger Engagement Report.
The number of tigers in India is now 2967.
But this is the New India, where we have fulfilled the goal.
When I was unveiling the tiger related data, I used to recall the forests of Gir in Gujarat.
I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time when the dwellings of lions in the forests of Gir started shrinking.
But now we have to go beyond conservation and think about sensitivity.
We need to keep ourselves healthy and also keep the country healthy.
I know that all these campaigns will also be enjoyed by social media.
Let us move ahead with a new zeal, new resolution and new energy.
I will wait for your words and your suggestions.
Let us all work towards building the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters and realizing the dreams of Gandhiji.
Let us move ahead with our joy as a service.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Whenever I had announced this thing, several teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked questions, suggested problems and discussed the problems.
The strength of the society is felt during the festival itself.
Sometimes it seems that we don't see exams in a proper way.
However, it is a question of life and death.
The exam you are going to give is a study exam for years.
This is not a test of your life.
You will see his experience, his wisdom, his success.
Therefore, the burden of these numbers may sometimes stop us from moving in the right direction.
Because there is a general perception that if a student turns his mind towards sports then his attention goes away from schooling.
I don't know whether everyone will feel right or not, but I have experienced that now Dep Breathing is very beneficial.
No, please accept as much sleep as your body needs, so that your reading time is not wasted.
This will help in enhancing reading energy.
Your concentration will increase.
You will be seated.
Your skills will grow in a holistic manner.
Whenever I convene elections, my neck strangleholds.
A folk singer came to meet me.
Yes, young friends, you are preparing for exams and I have bound you with my mind.
Therefore, the more I advise your parents not to bear burdens, the more I apply it to me.
Please make exams a festival to overcome every exam.
Thereafter, the examination will never be conducted anymore.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to associate with you.
My best wishes to you all.
It is said in the story that Jesus was standing near the store house of a temple.
Today, the people of the country are going to get the benefits of two schemes as gifts on a big day.
In fact, two new schemes are going to be started.
There is an atmosphere of curiosity around how cashless transactions can be carried out across the country be it villages or cities or be it school or illiterate or be it cashless transactions or be it cashless transactions.
In order to create e-payment habits for this purpose, the Government of India is going to launch the Incentive Scheme for Consumer and Small Businesses from today.
The scheme to encourage consumers is the "Lucky Grahak Yojana" and the scheme to encourage traders is "Dighi Dhan Vyapar Yojana".
15000 people are going to get prizes worth thousands of rupees per day.
These 30 crore people will also be part of this award scheme.
In the last few days, cash transactions have increased by 200 to 300 percent.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this area.
Our youth have made considerable progress in start-ups.
This digital event is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should focus on this sector with new technologies and new methods, but we have to associate ourselves with the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I urge people to share their suggestions and ideas before Mann Ki Baat.
When I look at these things, I can obviously say that I divide these into three parts.
In the coming days, this law will also do its work.
Whatever is required for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people is our priority.
As per the Investment Report, India is ranked 3rd among the top economies of the world in 2016-18.
The participation of students in such a large number of board exams indicates this direction that our children of Jammu Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
Congratulating the students for their enthusiasm, I congratulate their parents, their friends, their teachers and the heads of all the villages from within.
Brothers and sisters, This time I have asked the people's views for Mann Ki Baat. I can say that everyone's views are unanimous.
However, when I see your support, I see your cooperation, several efforts are being made to mislead you.
Their capabilities were reflected.
Today, once again they have accepted this challenge and I believe that the resolutions and collective efforts of 1. 25 billion Indians will make this country a new force.
However, misery is so widespread that some people still do not get rid of bad habits.
Even today, some people feel that the money of this corruption, the money of black money, the amount of money, the EA Benami Rupee will come back to the system by finding some or the other way.
They have gone unlawfully to save their wealth.
It is a matter of sadness that they have chosen the way of using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor people, by depositing money in their accounts or by doing something through them.
A very stringent law has been enacted for the Benami property and the arrangements made in it will be very difficult.
Whether the government wants to create problems for the countrymen
Appreciating the war against corruption and black money announced by Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh through this Rs. 2020 and Rs.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali Tehsil village in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This is the strength of my country, which includes the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice and the truth.
During the elections, I was discussing in Cha and it was spread all over the world.
People from many countries of the world also learnt how to talk about tea.
There was no festival, banquet, nothing because the notes were closed due to some financial constraints.
The bridegrooms also accepted it as a honour.
Bharat Maru and Dakasa Parmar of Surat have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriages, it is inspiring.
I bless the newly married Bharat and Daksa and convey my sincere congratulations to all of you for transforming the opportunity of marriage into this great Yajna and turning it into a new occasion.
Friends, you are my true soldier.
I am very well aware that all of you have been active in this noble activity.

He taught the common man that he might be free from all concerns.
I believe that it will not take longer if all the youth of India are engaged in this task.
In a month, we can stand up as a new modern India in front of the world.
We must take forward this struggle to free the country from corruption and black money.
People from far off places will realise that Indian life is the origin of the festival and it is natural.
Deepawali's Deepawali is the festival of Deepawali's Deepawali, which is the shadow of darkness and the darkness of the individual.
We all know this thing very well that if we visit any place in India, if we go to the richest of the rich, if we go to the poorest of the poor people then we will get to see the cleanliness drive in every family on Diwali festival.
I mean to say that the festival of light is going to be a source of inspiration for the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
When we are celebrating Diwali, someone stands in the desert, who is protecting the Himalayan summit, who is protecting an industry, who protects the airport.
In addition, I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also make immense sacrifices.
In a way, the entire Armed Forces are receiving very good messages and I would like to share with you the Appy Divali.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are seen not only on the borders but also in every sphere of life.
The need of the hour is to fulfil the hopes that have been created among the poor people of the country.
The darkness of the village in the 21st century will not happen anymore.
Sardar Saheb has given us Ek Bharat, it is our responsibility to make it a Shreshtha Bharat.
It is the root of unity that creates the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Sardar Saheb was not only a man of struggle but also a creative person.
On this Ekta Diwas, on October 3, 2019, wherever we are, why should we remember Sardar Saheb and commit ourselves to unity
My dear countrymen, Karmik Purnima is also a festival of light in this festival of Diwali.
My dear countrymen, once again dedicate this Diwali to the jawans of the country.
My dear countrymen, salute to all of you.
Just a few days ago, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage to them.
Citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the power of anti-nationalism and after knowing the truth they have separated themselves from such people and have come out on the path of peace.
However, Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the anger among the citizens of the country has a huge value.
Very few people would know how these disabled persons have shown courage in the Paralympics this time.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that among the Divyangjans who did not get a medal or medal in the fourth run, they had taken even less than a gold medal winner in the general category.
Congratulations to all those who have done this thing and congratulated those who have tried to do it.
I urge the countrymen that for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we have to free the country from this problem.
Let us move ahead with a resolve.
They worked hard and contributed to the construction of about 9,000 toilets.

He played an important role in bringing gold medals to India at the Olympics Games in 1928, 1932, in 1936.
We know the names of all cricket lovers Bradman.
Reading these messages of the people became a source of inspiration for me.
One Shri Ajit Singh has written in the Narendra Modi App - Please tell me about the girl child's education and their participation in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in the Rio Olympics.
Thousands of people have spread this kind of thought.
It cannot be denied that we cannot perform our hopes.
In some cases, it has happened that our sportspersons did not reach the same level and they got only two medals in the medal list.
But it is also true that despite not getting the medal, Indias sportspersons have performed well for the first time in many sports.
In such a short span of time, Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna are connected to Tennis.
Several sportspersons like Aditya Ashok, Atanu Das, Atanu Das and others who have performed well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
If we do what we have done, we may have to be distressed again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.

The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
He always tried to live there as a teacher.
Not only this, he always used to say, The best teacher is the one in whom the student never dies.
You will have experiences like me.
Your teachers will change the perspectives of all the teachers who have told the world about the good things that have been done in your lives, their pride will increase.
It is our collective responsibility to enhance the dignity of teachers in our society.
We all hope that the lives of our country, our society, our family and of every individual are destructive.
But we are now living in independent India.
Therefore, let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Swarajya Our Rights' at a public Ganesh festival.
"Surajya should be our priority.
Can we not spread this message through public festivals
Why should we not use the Ganesh idol built on the soil of village Pokri instead
The statue made of plastic of Paris has adverse effects on the environment.
He has shown many other distresses.
I also urge you all - why should we not revive our ancient traditions by using soil-made idols
The destruction of Lord Ganesh.
Therefore, we should not create such Ganesh which will create obstacles.
From saints, sages and great men, we always learn something or the other.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani for their contribution to the foreign policy of the country.
My dear countrymen, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister but I am a human being like you.
You can imagine that an ordinary teacher, an old woman with pension money, who is giving 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers for freeing them from stealth smoke and for providing gas connections, this is not a small thing.
50 thousand rupees is not bigger but it is the feeling of that mother and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters.
Those people who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by leaving behind these small children, they will sometimes be responsible for this innocent child.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen, brighten and enhance the issues of unity and yet the country can brighten its future.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we used to think about droughts but today rain is getting enjoyed and news of floods is also coming.

I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pilgrims visiting the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan will be able to understand how big it is.
This year Gujarat has taken up several projects like Amravan, Ekta Van, Shahid Van and planted crores of trees as Van Mahotsav.
I cannot mention all the states but they deserve to be congratulated.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
This was my first visit, there is diplomacy in foreign travel, trade talks and security talks.
But what I want to say is that this time I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who have sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
But Indians got ready to sacrifice their lives for those who visited them.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have transformed the roots of our lives in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Artisan Verma for conveying my message to me.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in independent India.

I cant do everything myself.
Just as people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedarnath, I can feel your efforts to emphasize on positive things.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat and the inputs received are completely different from that of the government.
People have asked for something, however, no such thing has come to my notice in the last five years.
And you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Therefore, the entire country had dedicated an election not for its own interest but for the protection of democracy.
Their hard work has led to more votes this time than the previous year.
You will be surprised to know that the ECI employees had to travel for two days to reach there.
India also has the highest number of polling stations in the world.
The Centre is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahol-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Though these stories were about a hundred years ago, their relevance still remains the same.
I had a different experience after reading these things.
As the issue of reading is going on, I would like to say that on one of the media I was reading about the Library of Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village in the thick forests of Idukki.

A few days ago, I tried something different.

These two great personalities have brightened the name of not just Jharkhand but the entire nation.

He has done a great job by connecting this rare painting with the modern youth.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know about Tao Porchon-Lynch in America.
I realized how these schemes are bringing about changes in the lives of the poor.
