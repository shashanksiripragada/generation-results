Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My best wishes to you all for Deepawali and we have been told here: Shubha Karothi Kalyanam Wealth.
Deepajyotirnamastha in enemies destination.
How beautiful a message.
Currently, Diwali is celebrated in different countries of the world.
The festival is celebrated with joy and joy by not only Indians but also by the governments of several countries, by the citizens and social organizations of that country.
A kind of India is built there.
Friends, Festivals are a special attraction of tourism in the world.
Our India is a country of festivals, where there is a huge opportunity for all the festivals.
We should strive to promote Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, all these festivals and to involve people from other states and other countries in this joy.
We have so many festivals in every state and region. People from other countries are interested in this festival.
This is the reason why Indians living outside the country have a very important role to play in the development of tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had decided to do something different on this occasion of Diwali.
I had said - Come, let us all celebrate the strength of Indian women and their achievements in this Deepawali.
Immediately after this, there is a lot of inspirational stories in the social media.
Romesh from Warrengle, Namo App wrote, My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1960, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we have five brothers on a good livelihood.
My mother is my God.
He is the Laxmi of India.
Ramesh ji, my salute to your mother.
The television had an active lyricist husband, who was headed by Major Khushbu Kanya Bharati, the daughter of the bus conductor and the women force of Assam Rifles.
Kavya Tiwari ji had his daughter, Laxmi of India, who is also her strength.
He's proud that his daughter drew a very good picture, and took a very good place in Clat.
Again, Meghalaya Jain wrote- A 92 year old woman has been serving passengers at Gualior Railway Station for many years.
Meghalaya was inspired by the humble nature and compassion of Laxmi in India.
People have shared a lot of such stories.
You must read, take inspiration and share some of the things around you.
I salute all the Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous woman poet of the seventeenth century, Sachi Honnamma, wrote a poem in Kannada language in the seventeenth century.
This is the feeling that all the Laxmis of India, whom we are talking about, it seems that the last of the seventeenth century was envisaged.
Peninda Permegandanu Himavantu, Peninda Bhrigu Perchinda Janakrayanu Javdedu means Himavantu meaning Himavantu that is Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu has become famous for her daughter Lakshmi and Janaka for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future in our society through our glorious and glorious work.
My dear countrymen, on November 12, 2019, the world will celebrate the 550th Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only in India but also in the entire world.
In many countries of this world, there are Sikh brothers and sisters who have dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I can't forget the journey of my Gurudwara to Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you, but it will take a lot of time for Mann Ki Baat.
He always placed service at the top of everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that selfless service is invaluable.
He fought vigorously against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has delivered his message far and wide to the world.
He was one of the most travelers of his time.
He had visited many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of all through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled many important religious places.
It is said that the famous saint of Assam, Shankar Dev was also inspired by his ideals.
He also travelled on the holy land of Haridar.
During his visit to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water.
Vidare, Guru Nanak Dev ji-Kesargit, Guru Nanak jira Saheb, a famous place which reminds us of him.
During a blessing, Guru Nanak ji had travelled to Kashmir and surrounding areas of the North.
This established a strong bond between Sikh religion followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet and accepted him as a 'guru'.
He also traveled to Uzbekistan and there he is also worshipped.
And during a sad hour, he travelled extensively to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lives in the hearts of millions of people, he followed his teachings with full devotion and continues to do so even today.
The journey was organised to commemorate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all the ambassadors, including the Golden Temple philosophy, also got an opportunity to learn about the Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who united the nation.
Just as Sardar Patel had the amazing ability to unite people, he was able to coordinate with those who had a difference of opinion.
Sardar Patel was also closely monitoring and examining the subjects.
In this context, he was a man of detail.
Besides, he was well-versed in organizational skills.
He was an expert in planning and strategies.
Whenever we read or heard about Sardar Saheb's methods, we get to know how excellent Orplanning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country participated in the Congress Ahmedabad session.
He ensures that no one suffers from water.
He also interacted with the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
Again, Khadi sales have gone up too much.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution Council.
He did an important job of ensuring our fundamental rights so that there is no possibility of any discrimination based on caste or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, had done a historic and great job of uniting the states and regions of this country.
There was a special feature in Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel that nothing was left out of his sight and he was watching everywhere.
On the one hand, his vision was focussed on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
Lakshadweep and Lakshadweep of the far-flung south have not avoided their goals.
Indeed, when we mention Sardar Patel's efforts, we discuss the role of Sardar Patel in certain parts of this country.
Like Lakshadweep he also played an important role in a small area .
Immediately after this news, Sardar Patel took immediate steps without delay.
He sent instructions to the brother-in-law of Mudalia, Arcot Ramswami Mudalia and Arctic Laxmanswami Mudalia, who immediately hoisted the National Flag along with the residents of Trevor.
According to his instructions, the surveillance of the neighbourhood was carried out immediately and the dispute over Lakshadweep was defeated.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the brother-in-law of Mudalia that they should personally ensure that all help is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing immensely to India's progress.
This is an attractive tourist destination and a fascination .
I hope you're going to visit these beautiful islands and their beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's longest human statue.
This is twice the Statue of Liberty of America in 1957 .
The tallest statue of the world fills the hearts of every Indian with pride (Indian chest comes with pride when it feels that the longest statue of the world is situated in our country).
The head of every Indian becomes higher in spirituality .
You will be happy to know that in a year 26 lakh tourists had come to see the statue of Statue of Unity .
That is , everyday about eight and a half thousand people have been able to see the glory of this Statue of Unity .
The faith that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has in his heart, the faith that he has got, this has been expressed .
Now there are several attraction centres like Cactus gardens, butterfly gardens, Jungle Safari, Children's Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery etc. which are continuously developing and the local economy is improving, people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being imparted for hosting facilities at home or at home .
Local people have started cultivating dragon fruits and I am confident that this will become the main means of their livelihood.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for the country, for every state and for tourism industry.
How can we witness that a place can become a world famous tourist spot within a year where people from within the country and abroad come .
Transportation system, lodging places, presence of guides, environment friendly systems - each one of them is progressing.
Massive economic development has started and local people are innovating services as per the needs of tourists .
The government is also fulfilling its obligations.
Friends, there is such an Indian who would not be proud to know that a few days ago, the Time magazine had placed this Statue of Unity in the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that all of you will be able to see this Statue of Unity by taking some time out of your precious time, but I am sure that every Indian who comes out for the journey should visit at least fifteen destinations of the country and spend the night there.
Friends, you are aware that every year from 2014, 31st October is being celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
It is a day to reinforce the unity, integrity and security of our nation at any cost.
RAN for Unity is being organised today.
This will involve people from all walks of life.
Running is beneficial for both mind and body.
I hope that all of you will be participating in the race on 31st October for the unity of the country and for keeping your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had united the country.
This mantra of unity is a revision of our lives and we should strive to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been active and alert to strengthen the country's unity and thinking about it.
There will be several examples around us that are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their words are quick to resemble our memories.
Friends, I remember the month of September 2010 when Allahabad High Court had given the verdict of Ram's birthplace.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi was also assassinated on this day.
Today, my dear countrymen, if a story is narrated in every house, in every village, from the east to the west, from the north to the south, if a story is narrated in every corner of India then it is cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village has a pleasant experience of cleanliness because of the efforts made by 1. 25 billion Indians.
25 billion Indians have benefitted out of it.
But there is a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I've heard and I want to hear you.
In such a difficult situation, being so opposite is no less heroic.
In such a scenario, our fearless soldiers are not only safeguarding the country's borders with bravery but they are also running a clean Siachen campaign there.
It's so cold that nothing goes wrong.
In such a scenario, segregation and management of garbage is an important task.
We all know that Siachen is a hemisphere that is the source of rivers and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at one place is aimed at ensuring pure water for those living in low lying areas and using rivers like Nubra and Siok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are such a festival that creates a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, some or some other new shops are being brought from the market.
I once told you that we tried to buy local items.
If we get the things we need in our own villages then there is no need to go to Tahsil.
If I find it in Tehsil, I don't need to go to district.
The more we try to buy local items, the more Gandhi 150 will be yourself in a great festival.
And I always make a request that we don't tie our threads, we should buy something or something made by our Khadi workers.
In Deepawali, before Deepawali, many people had bought a lot of things, but there are others who believe that after Deepawali, things might be cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who still have to buy.
I would like to convey my best wishes to Deepawali and I would like to appeal to you all to come here and buy local items.
See, how can we play an important role in the success of Mahatma Gandhi's dreams
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Like everybody in Deepawali, we use bets.
But sometimes there is a fire.
Sometimes he's wounded.
I urge all of you to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
My best wishes are with you.
Thank you so much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Is there any Indian who does not feel proud of our Armed Forces and our soldiers
Yesterday, 250 crore Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recall the incident of Surgical Strike in 2016, when our armies gave a befitting reply to the perseverance shown in the name of Proxy War against terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces have organised exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lions, particularly the youth of the country can feel our strength, our strength and our soldiers can save their lives and protect our countrymen.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, our Armed Forces showcased the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces to our youth.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, on the land of brave warriors.
It is certain that our armies will give a befitting reply to all those who want to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
But it is not for the sake of respect and sovereignty of the country.
India is always committed to maintaining peace and stability.
Over one lakh soldiers have laid down their lives for peace in two World Wars of the 19th century. This is the war that we had nothing to do with.
Our vision never falls on the land of any other country.
It was our commitment towards peace.
A few days ago, on 23rd September, we recalled the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancer who had rescued Haifa from the invaders on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa war in Israel.
It was also an exhibition of our soldiers for peacekeeping.
Even today, India is among the largest number of UN peacekeeping forces deployed in the world.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in the peace process of the entire world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
My dear countrymen, our wind power is incomparable.
The most interesting part of the Republic Day celebrations is the Fly past where our Air Force has a glimpse of extraordinary skills and strengths.
We observe Air Force Day on 8th October.
When the Pakistani invaders initiated an unprecedented attack in 1947, the Air Force ensured that the Indian Air Force and the warships reached the battlefield at the right time to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The IAF also gave a befitting reply to the enemy during the 1980s war.
Who doesn't know about the 1971 Bangladeshi rebellion
The Air Force played a very important role in liberating Kargil from intruders in 1999.
Continuous bombardment of enemy bases in Tiger Hill was carried out by the Air Force.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or emergency management, the entire nation is grateful to the Air Force for their remarkable role.
The Air Force's contributions are exemplary in combating natural calamities like storms, storms, floods and hazards, as well as in helping the people of the country.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring equality of men and women in the country and has opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now, along with the Short Service Commission, the Air Force is also selecting the options of the Permanent Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that the Indian Armed Forces are not only male power but also female power.
The whole country was worried about how to save him.
You must know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave, courageous and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash was the first Indian who was travelling the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
For 80 days, the Golden Globe race in the south of the Indian Ocean was running at a rapid pace.
He told me of his pledge to do something daring to do with such a great danger...
I pray for the rapid recovery of Abhilash Tomy and I hope that his courage, this valour, this determination to win will inspire and inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, the children are also aware of the significance of October 2nd.
This year has a special significance.
For the next two years, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi across the world.
The thoughts and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world today.
Everyone, like Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, has gained strength from Gandhiji's ideals and struggles to achieve equal rights and dignity of the race.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of revered Bapu which needs to be done by all the countrymen.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some concepts in the form of constructive programme.
Later on, when the freedom struggle began to grow in 1984, Gandhiji made a revised copy of his ideas.
Revered Bapu presented his thoughts to the people of the country on various topics such as farmers, rural people and the rights of labour brothers, cleanliness, education etc. which are also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public communicator.
Bapu's speciality in meeting people and adopting people was his nature.
This is the essence of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the countrymen realise that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He transformed this achievement into a mass movement which was his greatest contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, every section of the society, every section of the society had dedicated themselves to the call of Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapu gave us all an inspirational mantra, which we know is the magic of Gandhiji.
Gandhiji had said there: I am talking about a trick of yours. Remember my thoughts whenever you feel suspicious or arrogance touches your minds.
Remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen in your life and ask yourself how useful it will be for that person.
So will millions of hungry and unsatisfied people achieve self-rule
That's when you're gonna notice your suspicion and your arrogance.
My dear countrymen, Gandhijis vision is equally important today.
Today, the economic power and purchasing power of the country's growing middle class are rising.
If this benefit reaches the poorest of the poor, then my happiness will increase manifold.
In the coming days, whenever we buy something from Gandhiji, whenever we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that every purchase of ours makes every Indian better and everybody who sweats and invests, who harnesses his or her talent, everybody gets some benefit.
This is Gandhijis strategy, this is Gandhijis message, I believe that a small step of yours can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, we can feel that we can contribute immensely to the economic progress of our country, to the economic empowerment of our country, to fight poverty.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era and it is a tribute to the venerable Bapu.
Think about buying Khadi and Handicrafts on a special occasion.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji with revered Bapu.
As the name of Shastri ji comes to us, it means that there is an infinite reverence in the heart of Indians.
His gentle personality always fills the hearts of every citizen with pride.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked soft from outside, but he was firm in heart.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra was a symbol of his great personality.
In a short span of nearly one and a half years, he had given the mantra of reaching the heights of the success of the country's youth and farmers, which is the result of his selfless penance towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate Swachhta to the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school that was founded by the revered father himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, corporate world have contributed to the cause of Swachhta.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Swachhta lovers for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namaskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I particularly thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
This time India is hosting the worlds largest Swachhta Sammelan - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officials from the Ministry of Cleanliness from all over the world and experts from all over the world will come and share their experiences and applications related to transparency.
It is imperative to ensure freedom, peace and justice for the exploited, the oppressed and the deprived.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on October 12, 1993.
Within a few days, NHRC will complete twenty-five years.
NHRC not only protects human rights but also helps in enhancing spiritual pride.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister Pratyat Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that we do not have any foreign idea of human rights.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideal ethos of the Vedic age, "Sabka Bhawan Happiness".
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing misuse.
During the twenty-five year visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the people of India.
I think this is a healthy society and a hope for democratic values.
Now 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the National Human Rights Commission.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year also, let us try to organize 'Run for Unity' in our villages, towns and cities.
Run for Unity is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the country's unity throughout his life.
I urge all of you that on 31st October, through the Run for Unity, we strengthen this effort to unite every section of the society, to unite every individual and that is the best tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you for this holy festival of Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens on this virtuous occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan is a symbol of the love and faith of sisters and brothers.
This festival is a great example of social harmony for centuries.
There are so many events in the history of the country that we have seen how a relationship binds people of two states or different religions to be trusted.
A few days later, Janmashtami.
The air will be heard in the air by the name of Hathi Ghod Pal Ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal Ki and Govinda-Govinda.
It's a different joy to dress yourself in the color of Krishna.
Children must have started organizing Dahi-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I'm grateful to Chinmayer for taking care of it.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I also congratulate all those who have worked towards preserving, carrying forward and reaching out to the masses.
Every language has its own importance.
There is a vast pool of knowledge that can be used in every sphere of life in Sanskrit language and literature.
Whether it is science or technology knowledge, agriculture or health, scientific science or architecture or architecture, numeric or management, economics or environment, our mantra of combating global warming has been elaborated in detail.
You will be happy to know that all the people of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as a medium of conversation today.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which eternal words can be produced.
Sometimes we use English quotations, sometimes Shayari etc. to weigh something.
But those who are familiar with the well-known words of Sanskrit know how few words can be accurately explained through these well-known words of Sanskrit.
That is, if a Guru gives his disciple the knowledge of one letter, then there is no such thing or wealth in the whole world that can give away the debt of a disciplinary Guru.
On Teachers' Day, we remember the great scholar and former President of India Bharat Ratna Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
On his birth anniversary, Teachers Day is celebrated across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and recall his dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and sisters, those who have worked hard, have received news of the rains.
A few days ago, we saw a flood of floods harassing the lives of the people of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come closer to Kerala.
Our deepest condolences to those families who have lost their loved ones in this disaster.
I would like to assure all the bereaved families of the 125 crore Indians who have stood shoulder to shoulder with you in this difficult time.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover quickly.
I believe that the life of the people of Kerala will be quickly normalised by the indomitable energy and courage.
The way disasters devastate peoples lives is unfortunate, but in this very short span of time, we also appreciate the religion of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, every person has been trying his best so that the areas where disasters have become alarming, whether in Kerala or in any district or region of India, the lives of the people of all these places are naturally transformed.
People of all ages and people associated with all forms of work are helping them.
Everyone is wondering how the sufferings of the people of Kerala can be shared, so that they are deprived of it.
We all know that the Armed Forces are the heroes of Kerala disaster relief.
They have taken all the measures to save the flood victims.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BS-F, CI-S-F, RAF, all have jumped to the rescue and relief operations.
I would like to specifically mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked to tackle these calamities is commendable.
The capabilities of NDRF, their commitment and the ability to bring the situation to the fore with speedy decision-making have created a sacred seat in the minds of all the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I have seen that most of the people who read the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat this time have been written by our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, several others from Katihar in Bihar to Akhilesh Pandey have requested me to share various aspects of Atal ji's life in Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On 16th August, the people of the country and the world have received news of Atal ji's death and have expressed deep condolences.
He is a nation leader who quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and went far from active politics in the last ten years.
He couldn't be seen in the news.
The affection, reverence and grief shown by Atal ji is a symbol of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I would like to tell you one more example of Atal ji's great personality is the political culture that he has tried to bring about changes in the political culture and the striving to provide a systematic framework to political culture will benefit the country and it will also benefit the country in the future.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Economy Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brings about two significant changes in the politics of our country.
The first is to limit the Cabinet of States to fifteen percent of the total seat of the Assembly.
Atal ji brought about changes in this system, resulting in savings of money and resources, efficiency and efficiency.
Atal ji was the only visionary who transformed the situation and brought about a healthy and good governance system in politics.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
Atal ji presented the budget in 2001 at 11. 00 pm instead of 5.
One more Azad, we benefited from Atal ji's tenure through the creation of Indian flag code.
This is from 2001, which enables the universal movement of the tricolor.
The common Indians get the opportunity to hoist the National Flag.
This way he brought our favourite tricolor to the people.
You must have seen how Atal ji had strengthened the country by bringing about changes in the electoral process and by taking bold steps in the election of the people.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the House today, there is a ban on the hailstorm, but when something good happens then there is no special discussion about it.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament was concluded a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
As a result, Lok Sabha 21Ts and Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills, all MPs have tried to make maximum use of the Monsoon Session by leaving the interests of the Party.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important Bills have been passed for the upliftment of youth and backward classes in the session.
You all are aware that for decades, OBC Commissions like SCST Commissions were being constituted.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled its resolve to set up the OBC Commission this time and has given this institution a constitutional right.
This measure will help in successfully pursuing the cause of social justice.
Passage of the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has also started in this session.
These laws will further protect the interests of the people of SC and ST communities.
At the same time, it will protect their criminals from atrocities and enhance their confidence.
No civilized society can tolerate injustice in the country's genocide.
The crime will be punished for a minimum of 10 years, and the rape of girls below 12 years will be executed.
Just a few days ago, you might have read in the newspapers that a court in Mandasore, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of hearing, convicted a girl for rape.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh sentenced the perpetrators to death for just five days after the hearing.
A court in Rajasthan has also given such speedy judgement.
These laws will go a long way in resolving criminal cases against women and girls.
Financial progress without social change is incomplete.
The Lok Sabha passed the Third Talaq Bill, although it was not possible to pass this session in Rajya Sabha, I assure Muslim women, the entire country is with all its might to ensure justice to them.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country, we can bring about changes in the lives of the poor, the backward, the deprived and the deprived.
This time in the Monsoon Session, everyone has set an ideal together.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this juncture, the Asian Federation is committed to the vision of millions of Indians.
Everyday in the morning, every Indian sportsperson has won a medal in newspapers, television, news and social media.
Asian Games are still underway.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to all those who are yet to compete.
Indias athletes, particularly Shooting and Wrestling, are performing well. Our athletes are bringing medals to all the games that we have not achieved before.
These are not medals alone. It is a testimony to the courage and vision of Indian sports and Indian competitors.
There are a lot of our daughters in the list of medal winners for the country, this is a positive one.
Even the youngsters who won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the sportspersons who have won medals have risen from unprecedented villages and mafswalls and have worked hard to achieve this.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts and pay my homage to the legendary sportsperson Shri Dhan Chand ji.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country to sport and pay attention to your fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
India will build a bright future only when India will fit.
Once again, congratulating the winners of the Asian Games, I also wish the rest of the sportspersons the best.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is that place where this unforgettable blend of architecture and engineering is seen.
Everyone was surprised to see Rani Ki Bao in the eleventh century in Patan in Gujarat.
Engineering laboratories are always there in the land of India.
In India, there are many engineers who have imagined the unimaginable and have set an example of excellence in the engineering world.
There are also gems in the legacy of our great engineers whose work still surprises people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he was revered and remembered by the rest of the country.
He was commemorated as Engineers Day on 15 September.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have created their own independent identity in the ancient world.
I am reminded of the unprecedented achievements of the Engineering world in 2001 when there was a terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujarat.
He was joking to see me, look at my house.
Kutch calls it Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was saying this thing with pride and I felt that many years ago, engineers used to think about the local environment and situations and build houses so that people could be safe.
Now when we commemorate the Engineers Day, we will have to think about the future and organize workshops at different places.
We have to imagine what new things we need to learn while changing.
Should we teach
The world is fighting natural calamities.
What will be the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
What should students teach
I convey my best wishes to you all for this feeling.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It has raised the mindset of people.
You must have seen that a team of 12 teenage football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It takes usually hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day Bhagyadevi had a different desire.
When they entered the cave, a lot of water accumulated in the cave due to heavy rains.
All efforts are being made to know where the girls are, how they are, how they can be brought out.
But I'd like to see this whole thing a little differently.
The government, the parents of the children, the people of the family, the media, the citizens of the country have made everybody feel proud of peace and patience.
Everyone has joined this mission collectively.
I think it is a matter of learning and decentralising everybody.
Parents didn't feel sad or mother didn't drain their eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint, peaceful use of the entire society is a matter of learning for us.
The operation killed a Thailand navy soldier.
The world is surprising that despite such threats, the rescuers have worked patiently and patiently in the dark cave.
This shows that when people are united, a lot of strange things happen.
It is essential that we concentrate on our goals in a quiet mind and work for them.
A few days ago, our country's popular poet Neeraj died.
The salient features of poet Neeraj were hope, trust, determination and confidence.
All the words of poet Neeraj ji can inspire all Indians.
He wrote: The darkness will be removed as soon as there is a storm, whenever there is lightning, darkness will be removed and I pay my respects to poet Neeraj.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
This is because this is the time when a Peak Session is being organized for colleges.
Like the truth, millions of youngsters went out of school and went to college.
uestion-answer written in the month of February and March, enjoying the holidays in April and May, the results, future life patterns and career choices were spent.
July is the month when the youth takes a new path in their lives and moves away from focus to cut-off.
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of professors from the umbrella of parents.
I believe that my young friends are very encouraging and happy about the celebration of college life.
For the first time, getting out of the house, going out of the village, coming out of a safe environment, you have to show yourself the path.
So many youngsters left their homes and took life forward in a new way.
There's no way out of books, we have to study, but we're gonna have to keep looking for subtle things.
Old friends are very precious.
The youth who left their homes and went out of their homes should discover that place and know about the people, language, culture there.
I convey my best wishes to all the youngsters.
Her father forever took the trash of Astatuk and nurtured the family.
I congratulate Asharam for this success in that situation.
There are so many such families who have shown their hard work and concentration in adverse conditions that inspire us all.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, the father of DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata, who studied under the light of the footpath road, the daughter of Ahmedabad's daughter Afreen Shaikh, the daughter of Auto Challan, the daughter of a school driver from Nagpur, Karthik, son of Haryana Chowkider, or Ramesh Sahu, son of a brick-keeper from Jharkhand.
From the birth of Anushka Pandey, a disabled girl from Gurgaon, the victims of hereditary diseases called Spinal mascular autopsy have achieved a great success in showing the world through their determination and their minds.
Looking around us, we will get such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I witnessed a news that says, Modi's dream has been fulfilled by two youths.
After reading the internal news, I came to know how our youth is trying to transform the lives of ordinary people through smart and creative use of technology.
In a similar fashion, I had urged the Indian youth to interact with the Indian youth in San Jose, the technology hub of America, to think about how they can use their talents for India and do something out of time.
I had requested to replace brain-drain with brain-gain.
Two Rae Bareli Professionals Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji acknowledged this challenge and made a unique effort.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have combined a smart village app.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the entire world but will also get information or news from their mobile phones.
The App provides telephone directory, news sections, event lists, health centres, information centres etc.
The app is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT rate among the Kisans is being marketed for selling their produce from one side.
Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone.
Indeed, the journey to Pandharpur is a unique festival.
Friends, The eighteenth month of the eighth month, which was held on 23rd July this year, is celebrated with the holy festival of Pandharpur.
Pandharpur is the holy city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
The monks like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were taken to Pandharpur to dance in the name of Lord Vithal in a footwear palanquin.
Devotees visited the place for the philosophy of Lord Vithal, also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the poor, the helpless, the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have unwavering reverence and devotion towards God.
You go to Pithoba Temple in Pandharpur, you have a different feeling of greatness, beauty and spiritual joy.
My request to the audience of Mann Ki Baat is that if the opportunity comes, he will definitely experience the holy journey of Pandharpur.
Several such saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still teaching people in Maharashtra.
We get the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them in the shlokas like 'Vrud' or 'Avng'.
We have got this mantra that society can fight against blind faith with devotion.
They have guided the society in the right time and have ensured that old evils are removed from the society, they have brought compassion, equality and goodness to the people.
Likewise, Lokmanya Tilak was a great personality who had left deep impressions on many Indians.
We remember Tilak jis birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and self-confident.
He had the power and intelligence to mislead the British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he had been charged with treason three times in 20 years.
I would like to recall Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, Imagine that more than 40 thousand people gathered to welcome him 100 years ago.
Later, as Mayor of the Municipal Corporation, Vallabhbhai Patel decided to set up the memorial of Mahamanya Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Naturally, the British ruler was extremely dissatisfied with the fact that the Collector used to propose to construct a memorial called Smaru Haila.
But Sardar Saheb, Sardar Saheb, he will resign if need be, but Lokmanya Tilak's memorial will be established.
The statue was finally inaugurated by Sardar Patel and invited Mahatma Gandhi on February 28, 1929.
Revered Bapu had said at the inauguration ceremony that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only received one person as Mayor but has got the strength to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the characteristics of the statue that Sardar Patel had founded here is that Lokmanya Tilak ji is inscribed here in the chair, which says, Swaraj is my birthright.
It sounded like God's command to the English.
Lokmanya Tilak started the first public Ganesh Festival.
The Ganesh Utsav has traditionally enriched the spirit of respect and hosting, but has become an influential medium of social awakening, unity, equality and egalitarianism.
Now Ganesh Mandap can be seen in the streets of Aali in any city.
All the families of that street merged with the Ganesh Festival.
This is an extraordinary opportunity for our youth to acquire special capabilities like organisation and leadersship and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said the last time also that I would like to recall Lokmanya Tilak Ji. I would like you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with Dhammadham but celebrate 'Parivashbandh'.
May the statue of Ganesh ji be decorated with all his decorations and pujas.
Those who had dedicated their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in independent India.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
There are youngsters in India who cannot be inspired by this passage: Saraforshi Ki Tamna Ab Hamarilil May Hai Deekhna hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai ketanazu-e-kaatil may hai hai, these lines have inspired the jealousy like Ashfaq Uttak Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandra Shekhar ji had inspired many youngsters for the bravery and freedom of Azad.
Azad lived his life, but he never bowed to foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Chandrashekhar Azad's village Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute the two great sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Indias brave daughter, Kisanna Hima Das, won the Gold Medal in the 400m race at the 20th World Athletics Championship held in Finland a few days ago.
Indonesia has e-mailed me from Indonesia and is now preparing for the Asian Federation.
E-mails are writing solidarity: Mahendrashan in the life of any athlete when he holds the waves and I am proud that I have done it.
Unity, all of us are proud of you.
Her achievements are remarkable because she has made her own challenges a means of success.
At the road accident in 2003, solidarity in the lower part of the body of a fearless woman did not lose courage and made herself strong and reached her goal.
I salute Ekta Bhaiya ji, Yogesh Katuniya ji and Sundar Singh ji for their courage and struggle.
Please move ahead, play, grow.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals and festivals but sometimes diseases also enter the houses due to the weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the good health, for the motivation of patriotism and for the many festivals that have come in this month of August and for the centuries.
We will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you so much
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to meet all of you on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat once again.
A few days ago, there was a historical cricket match in Bengaluru.
Perhaps you are aware that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international test match and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
Both sides displayed excellent sporting skills in the match.
Rasheed Khan from Afghanistan played a very good role in IPL this year and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashrafgani tagged me in his twitter saying The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sportspersons.
Rasheed represented the best in Afghanistan, the Prime Minister said.
He was a treasure in the cricket world, and with it he wrote a little fun - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be remembered for all of us.
Though it was the first match, it's normal to remember, but I'll remember the match for another thing.
The Indian team has done something that is unprecedented all over the world.
While taking the Indian team to Trophy, a victorious team showed what it could do.
While taking the Indian Team Trophy, the Afghanistan team invites those who are playing international matches for the first time and photographs together.
We can experience this thing as to what could happen to Sportsman spirit and sportsmanship.
The best way to find out the talent that our youngsters have for uniting sports societies.
My best wishes to the two teams of India and Afghanistan.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, on the fourth day of Yoga, a wonderful sight has been seen.
Be it the Brazil AEuropean Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese Navy's Fighter Ships, the people have been exercising Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga has been organised, and I am told that many women have also done the Demonstration of seats.
On the high peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China have performed Yoga together.
If people from all over the world participate in Yoga Day with so much enthusiasm then why not encourage it in India
Our warriors of the Air Force have performed Yoga asanas in the midst of the sky at a height of 15,000 feet.
It was a sight, they were not sitting in the air, they were fluttering in the air.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or sports fields, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A panorama of Ahmedabad was mesmerising, where about 750 handicapped brothers and sisters from all over the world performed Yoga together.
I am Mani, today Yoga is doing wellness, revolution.
Wellness is being pursued by Yoga, I hope it will progress.
Slowly many people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
You know, how did Kabirdas ji go to Aimaghar
He is the one who knows the sorrows of others.
He who doesn't understand the suffering of others, he's cruel.
Kabirdas ji had laid special emphasis on social harmony.
Jagmeh Barry Koi Nehi, Joe Mana Cool.
Give me pulses, please, everybody.
In another word, Kabirdas ji has said, "Please be Dharma Hai, greed or sin.
His precious words continue to have a similar effect today. Now, when we are talking about Saint Kabirdas Ji, I am reminded of one of his duplications.
This is the greatness of Guru and one such Guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown the path of truth to millions and millions of people, those who have been inspiring people for ages.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
There is another history associated with Punjab.
The horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which is about to be completed 100 years, has shamed humanity.
On April 13, 1919, a black day was forgotten, when the bullets were shot at innocent, unarmed and innocent civilians, crossing the boundaries of cruelty and misusing power.
The eternal message that has been conveyed to us is that violence and destruction can never be solved.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar of Rohini, written on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Dr.
Ramanji, first of all, thank you very much.
It is heartening to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, on 23rd June, Dr.
Perhaps very few people know that, in 1937, Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in Bengali at the Convocation of Kolkata University.
This was the first example when during the British rule a person spoke in Bengali at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata.
From 1950 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's first Industrial Minister and in a sense, he laid the foundation stone for India's industrial development and India's progress in a holistic manner.
In 1957, the first independent India was built on the basis of its industrial policy, its plans and vision.
Dr.
Mukherjees dream was that India will be self-reliant, developed and prosperous in every sector of the industry.
He wanted India to develop large industries and also focus on MSMEs, textiles and cottage industries.
He set up the Finance and Organisations set for sustainable development of cottage industry and small scale industries, for which All India Implementation between 1950 and 1950 was established.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed immensely.
He was very emotional about the improvement in West Bengal.
Her thoughts, wisdom and activity saved a part of West Bengal and it still remains a part of India.
Let us remember this unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and continue to strive hard to take India forward through courage and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of government schemes through video calls.
I got the opportunity to listen directly to the people after getting away from the files and the change in their lives.
People have made a solemn pledge of their own, of joy and sorrow.
I believe that it was not just a government programme but it was a different kind of learning experience. And what could be more satisfaction and satisfaction than what I have enjoyed in the eyes of the people at this time
Whenever I used to listen to an ordinary person, his simple words, his emotions, his feelings, he used to touch the heart.
I was aware of the fact that in a remote village how girls are getting help from the common service centre to the elderly of the village and from the pension of the elderly to the construction of passports of the common man.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing business of making ice cream from her and lakhs of youngsters from Jharkhand are running Jan Aushadhi and going to nearby villages and supplying medicines at affordable prices.
The youth of West Bengal who had been searching for jobs two-three years ago, he was successfully not only running his own business but also employing 10-15 people.
School students in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important topics like West Management at the School Tinkering Lab at an early age.
There were numerous such experiences and there was no corner of the country from where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that from the success of the government in the entire event, I have felt the power of success of the common man, the strength of the tenth country, the power of the dream of New India, the strength of the resolve.
There are some people in the society, unless they talk disappointingly, they do not talk about despair, they do not create distrust, they do not look for ways to break instead of moulds, they do not get peace.
In such a scenario, when people talk of new hopes, new zeal and accomplishments of their lives then their success is not for the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-40-50 lakh people have joined this video bridge programme and have given me new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I also felt that this smell of goodness is a smell of good.
In fact, Bangalores corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together to create a 'Sahaj Samridhi Trust' and activate the Trust to double the farmers income.
He said that through this trust, they are connected to the farmers, they have formulated the schemes and are trying to increase the income of the farmers.
With the new methods of farming, organic farming can be done and how crops can be grown along with crops. Through this trust, the cooperation of professionals, engineers and technicians is being provided to the farmers.
Earlier, the farmers who were dependent only on the crops and the crops would not have been benefitted. Today, they are not only producing crops but also making good profits through this trust.
The crops will be better only when good species of seeds are used and separate Seed Banks have been created.
The Seed Bank has been taken care of by women and women have also been linked to it.
My dear countrymen, the GST system is going to be completed one year.
Today the dream of One Nation One Tax was realised.
One Nation One Tax Reform: If I have to give credit to anyone for this system then I will give this credit to the states.
GST is a shining example of cooperative federalism where all the states have decided to work together for the welfare of the nation and as a result of this, such a massive tax refund system has been introduced in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can take pride in the fact that despite the fact that there are different political thinkers, representatives of different states and states with different priorities, the decisions taken in the GST Council have been unanimously taken so far.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but after the implementation of this system there is only one tax system in the country.
With the introduction of GST, check posts have also been shut down and this has resulted in faster movement of goods and other goods which not only saved time but also helped in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
This massive tax reform has been successful in India because the people of the country have adopted this system and this is the strength of the people and this has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally observed that it takes 5-7 years for such a large number of reforms to be implemented properly in such a vast country.
But the zeal of the honest countrymen, the flow of the country's honesty and the participation of the common man is the result of this thing that within a year this new tax system has made its place, it has got stability and it has been able to amend itself through the necessary inbuilt systems.
This is a great achievement that 125 crore Indians have achieved.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must remember that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been sailing for the past few months.
I would like to say something about Navika Sagar Parikrama.
These six daughters of India have returned to India on 21st May, 2019, via I-NSV Tarini for more than 250 days.
It has crossed 22,000 nautical distances across the oceans and a few seas.
This is an unprecedented event in the entire world.
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the fame of the Navy, for enhancing India's dignity and especially the daughters of India are not less in any part of the world.
You must have seen that in the last few days Mount Everest has got new information about winners.
On 16th May, five tribal students of a Ashram Vidyalaya in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Dhube, Pramesh Ale, Umakanta Mahobi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Swam - have won the highest horn in the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh since August 2017.
They were chosen in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning the Everest with the name, they have brought laurels for the country.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to these small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, the sixteen year old Shivangi reader has won Everest from Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
Ajeet Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest win the first couple of parents.
Not only the youngsters are winning the Everest but also the 50th Mrs. Sangeeta Behl-O Everest on 19th May.
Some of the Everest climbers are not only skilled but also emotional.
This work is not only commendable but also a symbol of their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those bravehearts, especially the daughters.
So many people from all walks of life will come forward to support this.
About Fit India, I would say, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
People are sharing videos of their Fitness Challenge in Social Media and tagging others and challenging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and this challenge encourages us to remain fit and fit for others.
My dear countrymen, many times you have heard something about sportspersons and sportspersons in Mann Ki Baat.
"Chhobi Jadavji, thank you very much for your phone call
These games were a special part of summer vacations.
There are two dimensions of traditional games.
There's an outdoor and Indore too.
The unity in diversity of our country can be seen somewhere in these games.
The same game is known by different names at different places.
It was played on the Square Board of 8th by 8th with twin beaches or twin beaches.
In Madhya Pradesh, it is called Attu, in Kerala, Pakirakali in Maharashtra, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Thaiam in Rajasthan and Changapo in Rajasthan.
Even if the residents of different states do not know each other's language, they are right at the time of the game.
It's a game that can be seen everywhere in rural and urban areas.
It is also known in different parts of the country.
It is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla in Andhra Pradesh.
In Odisha, it is called Shootbari, in Maharashtra it is called Bittidalu.
Creation of traditional games will not only help in physical empowerment but also in enhancing our logical thinking, concentration, concentration and awakening.
These are not just sports but also sports that teach the values of our lives, teach our goals, determine our goals, achieve determination, build team spirit, help each other.
Just a few days ago, I was witnessing that our traditional sports have been included in the training programmes of Business Management to improve the overall personality and interpersonal skills.
At the same time, we are aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports create awareness about our society, environment etc.
Now schools, parties and youth should come forward to encourage these games.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum for our traditional games.
Video can be created to showcase the rules and regulations of sports.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation knows about these games, can play and grow up.
This is the theme Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you all to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and the harmful effects of plastic polythene on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I would like to urge the World Environment Day (WEDIA 2018) to see all the information and try to use it in their everyday lives.
Loss of life, loss of resources.
All this is the result of the changes that have taken place in Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has said for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, the COP-21 and the Paris Agreement. We have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
What can we do to make this world cleaner and greener
How can we move on this path, what can we do innovation
It's raining.
Now we can plant record numbers of trees, not only planting but also taking care of them till the trees grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You people remember June 21st, not only me but the entire world remembers June 21st.
Worldwide, 21st June is now celebrated as International Day of Yoga and it is unanimously recognized that the preparations for the event began a few months ago.
It is being reported that the entire world is preparing to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga gains courage, which always protects us like our father.
A spirit of forgiveness is created as a mother feels for her own children, mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
The subscribers had said that by doing yoga regularly, the truth is our son, mercy is our brotherhood, self-restraint is our brotherhood, the world is our bed and knowledge is our hungry.
Whenever there are so many qualities, this Yogi naturally wins all kinds of fears.
Once again I urge all the citizens to take forward the great tradition of Yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, on 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's Triple Talaq Day.
I salute Panditji.
In May 1857, Indians showed their power to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers have risen up against injustice.
Sadly, we have been calling the 1857 incident a rebellion or a soldier's rebellion for a long time.
Indeed, this incident was not only minimized but an attempt was made to hurt our self-respect.
Veer Savarkar had written that whatever happened in 1857 was not a rebellion but a first fight for independence.
Savarkar was accompanied by the 50th Birth Anniversary of the India House heroes of London.
He was a worshipper of both arms and scriptures.
Veer Savarkar, originally known for his struggle against Bahaduri and the British Raj.
But besides this, he was also an energetic poet and social reformer who always stressed on goodwill and unity.
Savarkar ji has given a wonderful account of our dear, respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Savarkar is bringing together poetry and revolution.
Besides being a compassionate poet, he was also an adventurer.
Our daughters, who were once forced to beg from the dustbins of garbage to the houses, today they are learning the work of sewing and sewing the poor.
I wish these daughters a bright future filled with hope and confidence.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something and you are grateful for it then you will be able to achieve it even in every difficult situation and you will see it in every corner of India.
In your neighborhood, you'll see the neighbours who are defeating the problem.
You have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, whenever we get satisfaction by eating tea there, some people get to discuss and analyze with them.
The discussions are political, social, film, sports, sports and athletes, the problems faced by the country should be resolved in such a manner but most of the times this discussion is limited to discussions only.
He arranged for education, health and food for all the children who came to school.
He erased the darkness of their lives.
Tamso Maa Aurangmaye, who doesn't know this word, but D Prakash Rao has done it.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
You will also be around to inspire people.
There's numerous incidents.
Let us take the positive mindset forward.
In June, it was so hot that people waited for the rains and hoped that the sky would look like a dazzle.
A few moments from today, people will wait for the moon.
Looking at the moon means idolizing.
The Eid festival marks the start of a spectacular festival at the end of one month of fasting in Ramzan.
My belief is that Idols will be celebrated with utmost diligence, especially for children.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of equity in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all

The whole country has seen this game.
The sportspersons have come from small towns across the country.
It has reached this place by crossing many hurdles.
Their parents, parents, guardians, coaches, other aiders, schools, school teachers and school-children have a significant role to play in the achievements that they have achieved today.
Their friends also have a role to play in enhancing the morale of sportspersons in every situation.
Along with the players, I thank all of them.
Shri Shashikant Bhosle shared a picture of his Swimming Pool and said, My body is my weapon, my basic substance water, my world is swimming.
Another, I feel happy and healthy while traveling in the morning by writing Ruma Devnath.
He also said that Fitness brings a smile and when we're happy, we're gonna laugh.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness and joy are fitness.
Dhabal butterfly is written with a picture of his trekking.
Travelling and trekking for me is Fit India.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see a large number of people enthusiastically motivating our youth for Fit India.
The painter gave a video to the Akshaykumar Twitter.
I've seen that video, you'll see, and this video shows him practicing a wooden thread.
He said that this exercise is very useful for stomach and back muscles.
I believe that such a movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You must be preparing.
The entire world has recognized the importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or in the world about the use of Yoga to keep the mental state normal for the entire physical development, mental development and mental stability.
Perhaps you've seen an animated video showing me.
I thank the Animation Manufacturers for taking utmost care of the work done by a teacher.
My young friends, all of you have come out of the scrutiny of examinations and are now thinking about vacations.
I would like to invite you for a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time learning something new.
Outside the four walls, the papers and computers get a chance to live a new way of life.
My young friends, for a special internship today, I would urge you all to work together for the three-four ministries of the Government of India like Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Division, Swachh Bharat Summer II.
The awards will be given to those who have worked very well in colleges and universities at the national level and those who have been successfully awarded IISc.
I once again invite the students and the youngsters to join the Internship to benefit from it.
I hope that our youth will take the movement of Swachhata forward.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experiences, send stories, send photos, send videos.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-fourth interaction through video conferencing, through video conferencing.
Just a few days ago, I saw that some youngsters from Delhi who are selflessly educating the poor children, have started a massive campaign to educate and educate the school going children of Delhi.
Initially, they explained to the children who were languishing and doing small work on the road, that they too got involved in this developmental work.
The programme, which started with 15 children from settlements near Geetha Colony in Delhi, has now become an integral part of the capital to educate over two thousand children.
In this campaign, young teachers are trying hard to change the society by taking out a free time of 2 hours from their daily busyness.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand have set an example of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
They have changed the fate of not only themselves but also of their respective regions.
Cultivation of chicken, corn and barley is done in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
As the hilly areas were not getting the price for their crops, but the farmers of Kapkot scheme used to sell their crops directly to the market and used to take the path of value addition.
They have produced biscuits from farm crops and are selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a government agency in Munar and opened biscuits.
Given the efforts of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit extends only to 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district and to Kosani Almora.
As a result of this effort of the farmers, the Turn Over of the company has not only reached 10-15 lakhs but has also provided food to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard that a war for water will begin in the coming days.
Everyone says that, but do we have no responsibility
Water conservation is no new thing for Indians.
There is no need to speak a particular language for reading books.
Our ancestors have done it in the past.
They have given maximum importance to the importance of every drop of water.
They have found a new way to save every drop of water.
Whenever you visit Tamil Nadu, you will find inscriptions in many temples related to irrigation, water conservation, water conservation, water conservation etc.
Large inscriptions can be seen in the temples of Monarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilapatti and Pudukottai .
Even today, many bouries are known as steep wells tourism sector, but in fact they are a shining testimony to the water conservation efforts of our ancestors.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Bauri in Jodhpur.
It is India's largest and most beautiful bourie and we must remember that this is the largest bourie in a region that has a severe water crisis.
Water conservation works will be as effective as April, May, June-July, water conservation works can be maintained in a better time and in advance.
Expenditure on water conservation from Manrega Budget.
Several initiatives have been taken for water conservation and water conservation in the last three years.
About Rs 32,000 crore has been spent every year for water conservation and water dam construction in the Manrega Budget.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of Rs. 64,000 crore, 55 i. e.
In the last three years, this water conservation and water conservation has greatly benefitted about 150 lakh hectares of farmland.
This has been possible due to the hard work of about 40-45 villages.
I will say, April, May, June, July and we will be here to take up a number of responsibilities for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, when there is Mann Ki Baat, there are several news from all sides of the country, letters and phones.
However, the people dont know anything about the philosophy of conferring the award winner Rabindranath Tagore's peacefully, beauty and integrity.
Please talk about this at Mann Ki Baat, so that people can know about it.
Rabindranath Tagore was a genius personality, a strange personality, but he always had a teacher in him.
He wrote in Gitanjali: He who has the knowledge as the responsibility to impart it to the students.
The collective meaning of keeping Rosa is that when a person is self-confident, he can feel the hunger of another person.
When he feels thirsty, he can feel the thirst of others.
This is the time to recall the teachings and messages of Prophet Muhammad.
The teachings of his life create a commitment to the path of equality and brotherhood between us.
Once he asked a Prophet, "What is the best thing in Islam"
The Prophet said, Feeding a poor and vulnerable person and maintaining harmony with everyone without knowing.
Prophet Muhammad believed in wisdom and compassion.
He had no pride in anything.
He used to say that pride is the supremacy of wisdom.
Prophet Mohammed was of the view that if someone has more than one needs, then give it to someone who needs it. Therefore, charity in Ramzan has a special importance.
In this holy month, everyone donates to the needy.
Prophet Mohammad believed that a person's own sacred soul blessed him and not a wealth.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is a land of compassion, service and sacrifice, which has guided millions of people across the globe.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of Lord Buddha's efforts, commitments and great responsibility in his path.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, goodwill and brotherhood.
This is the kind of human values that the world needs today.
Dad Saheb, Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Be it the people of the country, be it the oppressed or the deprived, Baba Saheb has strengthened this marginalized section of the society through the Constitution.
There can be no better example than compassion.
Lord Buddha's compassion for human suffering was one of his greatest qualities.
We all Asians have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar etc. Buddha's teachings are also linked to the roots of Buddha's teachings. And that is why we are developing Buddhist tourism infrastructure that connects the important Buddhist sites of Southeast Asia to the Buddhist regions of India.
I pray for the blessings of those great men all over the world so that we can fulfil our responsibilities in building a peaceful and compassionate world.
Today, we remember Lord Buddha, you will also hear the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to be of good fortune to Lafing Buddha but very few people know that Buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of India's security.
Perhaps you are wondering what could be the link between the Lufting Buddha and the Indian military power.
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May 1998, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had delivered a speech to the people of India, which had filled the country with pride, valour and happiness.
A new confidence was awakened among the people of India in the world.
That day was intellectual.
The nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan on 11th May, 1998, in the western part of India.
Twenty years of this test was conducted on the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful, on the one hand, India was able to demonstrate its strength in science and technology.
As we can say, that day is marked as a day to showcase its military power in Indias history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world an inner strength for peace.
In this way, when you will be able to be stronger as a country, you will be able to live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May 1998 was not only important because the nuclear test was conducted in that month but it was more important as it was done.
This showcased the entire world that India has the potential to scale new heights and new goals, keeping in mind the great scientists' land and a firm leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
Today, as we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of 11th May, 1998, the mantra of Atal ji Jaya Vigyan for India's strengths must be motivated to build a modern India, to make a strong India, to make a strong India and to make a strong India.
We have to make our energy a part of India's energy.
And then to see that the journey that Atal ji had started, we can achieve a new joy and a new satisfaction.
My dear countrymen, we will talk more about Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March, 2018
Representatives from ASEAN groups came here on 26 January 2019 and brought along various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had presented the Ramayana before us.
It means that the inspiration and influence of Ramayana is still the same not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, every time I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you.
I have read what was written in MyGov about the start of the online course of Komal Thakkar Sanskrit.
I am delighted to see your passion for Sanskrit as well as being an IT worker.
I have asked the stakeholders to inform you about this.
I also urge all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who have been working on Sanskrit to ponder over how to take forward this proposal of Komal kaakkar.
I have read the opinion of Shri Ghansham Kumar from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on Narendra Modi App.
The concerns that you have expressed about the declining groundwater levels are really important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every living being in this land.
You have requested for provision of water for animals and birds during summer.
Shakal-ji, your thoughts have brought me to all listening friends.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Yogesh Bhadresha said, Let me tell you something about the health of the youth.
According to him, our youth are physically weak compared to other Asian countries.
A few days ago, when Honble President of France visited Kashi, Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi wrote, the entire journey touched and inspired him.
He expressed interest and said that all these photos should be circulated on the video social media.
Pacific, Government of India shared all films on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi App.
I would like to tell all the children like Angha, Jayesh that all these letters that they sent to me will be blown away by my whole day's persecution, hard work.
All these letters, so many phone calls, opinions, the things I have read, the things I have heard and there are many things that have touched my heart.
They wrote their exams, shared vacation plans, and thought of the tricks of animals and birds in this summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have also sent a letter to me about the activities being undertaken throughout the country in the fields of Kisan Mela and Farming.
Some conscious citizens have sent me suggestions on water conservation.
During the festive season, many letters are also received about our festivals, our culture and traditions.
When I read your letter, I came to know that a rickshaw puller from Karimganj in Assam, Ali Ali, had constructed nine schools for the poor children with his will power, then the country's indomitable will power was realized.
When I heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Mohan Mohan Mohan Mohan Mohan from Kanpur, who travelled on footpaths and treated the brothers and sisters and provided free medicines, he was proud of the compassion and humanity of the country.
Calcutta taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister died due to lack of timely treatment the year before.
Many such inspirational events show the identity of my country.
Today, the whole world sees India with its own eyes.
Today, when the name of India is uttered with great respect, the emotions of the children and children of this country remain hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, it will become very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Because there have been many letters related to farming.
This time I have watched the video of the interaction with the farmer friends on the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan. And I believe that the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan should be seen by all the farmer friends and it should be used in their own fields.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri ji Lohia ji or Chatur Charan Singh or Chaturthi Devilal ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and public life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized the need for better agro-processing and conservation of trees, plants, forests etc.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia called for better income for our farmers, better irrigation and ensuring sustainability and enhancing food and milk production.
In his address, Christopher Charan Singh emphasized the need for farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have recorded record production in 2015-16 over the last five years.
They showed that if the goal is stable, if there is complete self-confidence, if there is a pledge then everything can be done.
Today, technology has been matched with the hard work of the farmers.
This has given a lot of strength to the agricultural producers.
In the letters that came to me, I saw that many farmer friends had written about the MSP and they wanted to discuss it in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a massive decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get fair price for their crops.
It has been decided that the MSP for specified crops will be at least one and a half times the investment.
Besides, the work on Agricultural Marketing Reforms in the country is also underway to ensure that the farmers get the right price for their crops.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the village to the world market.
For the farmers not to go far enough to sell their produce, the necessary infrastructure of 20,000 rural hats of the country will be upgraded to APMC and e-NAM platform.
It means that a system is being created to connect with every market in the country from the fields in a way.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the start of the 150th year celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I urge you to share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What could be the logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was previously under the charge of the Health Ministry.
Preventive Health Care is very cheap and easy.
The more we become aware of Preventive Health Care, the more individuals, families and societies will benefit.
Cleanliness is the first condition to keep life healthy.
Further, work is underway to create Health Wellness Centre across the country.
As a Preventive Health Care, Yoga has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
It is the result of our commitment that today Yoga has emerged as a mass movement and has reached home.
This year, International Yoga Day will be celebrated on 21st June and no more than 100 days will be left.
In the last three Antarashtriya Yoga Diwas, people from all parts of the country and abroad participated with great enthusiasm.
Even now, we have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage family members to join us.
In a new and innovative way, Yoga must be popularized among children, young and old people, be it men or women.
There are various events in the country on TV and electronic media.
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from now on till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga, but I am Yoga practitioner.
Some people made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thinking and made me a 3D Animated Video of Yoga.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayamas together.
Efforts are being made to make healthcare free, be it inclusive, affordable and affordable for the people.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, out of which more than 800 medicines have been sold at low prices.
New centres are being set up.
For heart patients, the cost of heart stents has been reduced by 85.
The cost of artificial knee implants has been reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, nearly 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
One new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
Every person needs your help to spread this awareness.
We all have to try together to get rid of TB.
Several years ago, Dr. Ambedkar had spoken of India's industrialization.
In his vision, Industrial Amen is a powerful medium which will impact the income of the poorest of the poor of the country.
Dr. Ambedkar dreamt that India will once become a strong hub of labour and industry.
Today, when Make in India is progressing successfully across the country, then that dream is a source of inspiration for us.
Indias position in the world economy is now like a bright star and the maximum FDI inflows are in India.
Global trade is now looking at India because we are now becoming the centres of investment and new traditions of innovation.
Dr. Ambedkar deeply believed in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar wanted that a person of the country should not live in poverty.
They also firmly believed that poverty cannot be eradicated by donating to the poor.
Today, schemes like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are producing young innovators and youngsters in our country.
The visionary, like him, had said at that time that river and valley management was the subject of the Parliament, imagining that a variety of executive committees would be involved in conservation and use of water.
Today, a historic step has been taken to expand the waterways and ports of the country.
The new ports and the old ports are being renovated on the coastal areas of India.
In the decade of 1947, when the whole world envisioned the second world war, the cold war between the two powerful powers and the anxiety of the nation, Dr. Ambedkar envisioned Team India or the soul of India.
He understood the importance of Federalism and hence the Centre and the States have to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we are inspired by the cooperative federalism at every level of the country-governance and the competitive federalism at every level of the country-governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for innumerable people like me belonging to the backward classes of the country.
The Prime Minister said that India is completely different: this is an India which is of Ambedkar, of the poor and of the backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May, 2019 to commemorate the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
The campaign will cover rural development, poverty and social justice programmes across the country.
I urge you all to take part in this national mission automatically.
My dear countrymen, in a short span of time, many festivals and festivals are coming: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishali.
On the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, let us remember the sacrifices and penance of Lord Mahavira.
The life and philosophy of Ahimsa preacher Lord Mahavir is an inspiration for us.
I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
As soon as the Easter comes, we believe that Jesus Christ, who desired the peace of humanity, had heard the words of goodness, justice, mercy and compassion.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue but we know from our daily experience that water does not colour.
Have we ever imagined that be it river or sea, why water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question was raised by generation of great scientists in modern India.
When we talk about science, first of all, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
His discovery is known as 'Roman Effect'.
We observe National Science Day on 28th February every year, as it is said, on this day, he discovered Light Scattering for which he was awarded the Prize.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose, scientists like India are proud of India.
Boson, a well-known particle named after Satyendra Nath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai. I inaugurated the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is interesting to know the wonderful work done in the field of science.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides collaboration in developing robots, boots and designed machines.
Nowadays, various machines are making their intelligence smarter through self-learning.
This technology can help improve the lives of the poor, the deprived and the helpless.
At this event of Artificial Intelligence, I wanted to ask the scientists what kind of artificial intelligence can be used to make life easier for the brothers and sisters of Divyang.
Can we get better forecasts about natural disasters through Artificial Intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence make healthcare easier
Just a few days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There a young man said that he has made a digital instrument where if anybody cannot speak, he writes about the instrument through the medium of instrument and you can talk in a way that you can talk to a person who is able to speak.
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence in such matters.
Science and Technology Valuneutral.
You have not added value to it.
Any machine will do what we want to do.
But it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, often fails in his work.
Once asked him about it, he said, "I have searched ten thousand ways not to create lights, meaning Edison has also made his own failures his own.
Incidentally, I am fortunate to be present at the workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo in Auroville.
As an architect, he challenged the British administration, fought against them, raised their rule in question.
Thus, like a great sage, he enquired about every aspect of life, found answers and guided humanity.
It's important to ask questions again and again to know the truth.
On National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I have received many messages about Safety and Disaster in times of crisis and people have sent me something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Narendra Singh has sent his comments on occupational safety at the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He wrote that the safety standards in our country are not good at art work and construction.
If we are not aware of the safety in our daily life, if we cannot attain safety, then it is even more difficult to ensure safety during any major calamity or disasters.
Above natural disasters, most of the accidents are the consequences of our mistakes.
If we are cautious and follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and protect our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that there are several guidelines regarding safety in workplace but those rules are not followed at all.
My request is that those metropolitan cities which have a fire brigade should go to different schools at least once in a month and drill them in front of students.
This will be of two benefits: to be cautious and the children of the new generation will learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the country in dealing with disasters.
A scheme called 'Upda-Mitra' has been started to train volunteers in Cyclone or Van-Pravan districts.
Training and awareness is very important.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of lives were lost every year in Lu or Hit Wave.
Thereafter, NDMA organised a workshop on Heat Wave and launched a mass awareness campaign.
We have a good outcome in the combined efforts of all.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave declined unexpectedly to about 220.
It shows that if we focus on safety only then we can stay safe.
I would like to salute all those who are present at the venue and help those who are victims of an accident.
The number of such heroes is not less than the number of names.
Besides, heroes of the Armed Forces, Fireand Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Forces and the Armed Forces, who risked their lives and rescued others from the crisis.
A few days ago, India and other BI MSTEC countries - Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal participated in this exercise led by India.
We've all heard them many times.
But today, if someone takes us on a plane and asks us what it is, where a live jacket is kept, how to use it, I am sure no one can answer it.
If each one of us is conscious of our own safety, then the security of the society is also included in them.
My dear countrymen, in this year's budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of Wasteto Wealth and Wasteto Energy through village biogas to create a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have been made for this purpose and its name has been given GOBAR Dhan i. e.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to clean the villages and convert the remaining waste of animals and animals to compost and bio-gas and generate income and energy from them.
Animal dung and other biological finites are used for energy generation in some European country and China.
But in India, it was not being fully utilised.
We are moving towards this objective by involving Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
The aim is to harness the bio-gas based energy consumption of cattle dung, post-harvest waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar-Dhan Yojana, farmers of rural India, rural brothers and sisters will be encouraged so that they do not see cow dung and waste as a source of income.
The cooking of biogas and the use of electric power will also lead to self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal rearers.
New employment opportunities will be created in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
An Online Trading Platform will be set up to facilitate proper implementation of the Gobardhan scheme which will connect the farmers to the buyers so that the farmers get the right price for cows and agricultural waste.
I would like to appeal to the enthusiasts, especially the sisters living in villages, to come forward and build a Self-Help Group, to make full use of this opportunity.
I invite you, come and join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs, make efforts to transform the waste of our villages into wealth and make cow wealth from cow dung.
But one unparalleled attempt was made in Raipur of Chhattisgarh which was the first Varjya Mahotsav organised in this state .
The objective of the Festival organized by Raipur Nagar Nigam was to create awareness about cleanliness, create creativeness of city waste and create awareness about various methods of reuse of garbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagarnagam, the people of entire Chhattisgarh and to the government and administration there for exhibiting the importance of waste management and cleanliness in an innovative manner.
International Womens Day was celebrated every year on 8th March.
Various events take place in the country and the world.
On that day, the country is honored with the Nari Shakti Puraskar, which has done exemplary work in various fields in the last few days.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development rather than women development.
Today, I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda's words.
Independence, 250 years ago, this idea of Swami ji reflects the feelings of Nari Shakti in Indian culture.
Today, it is the duty of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
Today, our women power has shown self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They have taken the country and society forward and have taken it to new heights.
Finally, our dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and equally involved in the overall development of the country.
A few days ago, a man gave me a very good suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, various events are organized to observe Women's Day but what can be organized to honour all the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and town
This number is not small but 15 lakh women have been engaged in a month-long cleanliness campaign.
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29,000 water-sacrifices meaning water-mitras, 10 thousand women swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women masons.
You can imagine how big it is
These women from Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, will transform the cleanliness drive in everyday life and the reform of cleanliness into a mass movement.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days back, I was watching the news that electricity reached the villages of Elephanta Island after seventy years of independence.
You are well aware of the fact that Elephanta Island is located in the sea at a distance of 10 km from Mumbai.
It's an important tourist destination.
I am surprised to know that despite being such a big centre of tourism in Mumbai, electricity has not reached the Elephant even after so many years of independence.
Till seventy years of age three villages of Elephanta Island i . . Rajbandar , Morbandar and Sentha Bandar , the darkness that had spread in the life of the people there , all these darknesses have come to an end and their lives have become bright .
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the village of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be illuminated by lightning.
This is not just a power but a new beginning towards development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago we have celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
The colour of Hollywood is as important as Holika Dahan, because of which the evil is burnt and destroyed.
On the day of Holi, sitting together in every noble beauty, sharing each other's happiness and joys is a beautiful moment and the festival of Holi is a messenger of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And just two days ago, we observed Republic Day.
It was the first such event in history that the top leaders of 10 countries were present at the celebrations.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter to me on the Narendra Modi App. He expressed his desire that I should touch the essence of his letter.
He wrote that on 1st February, space mission Kalpana Chawla died.
He has taken us forever in the Colombia Space Accident, but the world has inspired millions of youngsters.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash Ji for initiating his long letter with the eternal farewell of Kalpana Chawla.
If there is desire and determination, if there is hunger to do something then nothing is impossible.
Several electricians have contributed significantly to the Vedas creation.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, I don't know how many names
Today, we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. But hundreds of years ago, in our classics, Skandhpurana, it was said - Dashputra, Samakana, Dasapupudhana Promotion.
This shows the significance of European values in our society.
And that is why women have been given the status of power in our society.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the society and the family united.
Shri Prakash Tripathi then gave several more examples.
He writes, Our adventurous Raksha Mantri Nirmala Sitharamans "Sukoi-30" flight will inspire him.
Three adventurous women, Bhavna Kant, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi, have been the pilots of the aircraft and are currently undergoing training in the Sukoi-30 fighter aircraft.
Today, there are several areas where women are the first to live. Our Nari Shakti is showing something or the other.
It has also been added as e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women are also playing an important role in the ongoing positive changes in the country and society.
Today, when we talk about women empowerment, I would like to mention one railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment. Perhaps you are wondering what connectivity can be.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first railway station in India where all levels of employees are women.
Women employees in all departments.
Be it the Commercial Division, the Railway Police, the Ticket Tester, the Announcer, the Point Person, and the others, more than forty women workers are handling the station.
Today, our soft power is leading from the front.
Whenever there is talk of tribal women, there is definitely a picture in everyones mind, where there will be forests, hill chests, where there will be a familiar view of children walking on the heads of children.
But in Chhattisgarh, our tribal women, this Narishakti has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area.
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and guns have created a terrible atmosphere there.
Tribal women in such a dangerous situation are making themselves self-reliant by running e-Rixa.
In a very short span of time, all the women there have been partners in this process.
On the one hand, they are empowering themselves through self-employment and on the other hand they are changing the pictures of Maoist-affected areas.
Besides this, special emphasis is being given to environmental conservation along with everything.
I also compliment the district administration there, from grants to training, the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have been repeated saying, Something is something that does not fail to exist.
Whatever negativity, waste, whatever is needed, should be adapted to reforms.
And the characteristics of our society are to continue the process of sustained self-reform.
The identity of any living society lies in the process of self-revision.
Centuries of efforts against social evils and malpractices have been going on in our country personally and socially.
Efforts are being made to create awareness against social curses such as child marriage and prejudice.
He was administered a pledge in the State to fight malpractices such as prejudice and child marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youngsters, mothers and sisters, all of them have contributed in this fight.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain continued to cross the borders of the state.
It is essential that all the people of the society are part of the true development process and be free from this kind of misconduct.
Let us all collectively pledge to remove such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Ministers of the state, the administration of the state, and every person involved in the human order for describing such special and extensive issues for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan has written in MyGov from Mysore in Karnataka. Six thousand rupees per year was spent for the treatment of his father.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana earlier.
However, whenever he came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, the price of medicines from there was less than 75 per cent.
He expressed his desire that while talking about Mann Ki Baat, I should talk about it so that more and more people get information about it.
Over the last few years, many people have written to me on this subject.
I have also seen many videos and social media. Many are taking the benefits of this scheme.
And when I come to know of these things, I feel very happy.
I am deeply satisfied.
And I am also glad that the idea of Shri Dashu ji has come in the minds of others that the benefits he has got.
This will benefit the common man, especially the elderly, who are forced to take medicine everyday.
The life-saving medicines purchased from here are manufactured according to the approved standards of World Health Organization.
This is the root cause of affordable quality medicines.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
Not only are pharmaceuticals available cheaper but also provide employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at PM Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrit stores in the hospital.
The only objective behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra shared a film on Narendra Modi App.
The picture was such that my attention was drawn towards that picture.
A grandson had joined his grandfather in the Clean Mornah River Safai campaign.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan for cleaning the river Morna through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna River used to flow only twelve months ago, but now it depends on the weather.
Secondly, the river was filled with jungles, grass and waste water.
A lot of waste was being dumped in the river and its neighbourhood.
Therefore, an Action Plan was created and a day before Makar Sankranti, in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna, in fourteen kilometres area, both sides of Morana river have been cleaned.
The Swachhta drive continued in a similar manner on 20th January and I am told that this drive will continue every Saturday morning until the Morna river is completely clean.
This shows that if people make a solemn pledge to do something then nothing is impossible.
A massive change can be brought about through the Jan Andolan.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the administration of Purnigam and all the citizens who have been associated with this thing as a peoples movement.
My dear countrymen, you have heard a lot of discussions about the Padma Awards recently.
Discussions on news papers and TVs have attracted attention.
However, if we look at this thing with a little care then it will be a matter of pride for you people, it will be a matter of pride because what great people are among us and naturally it will be a matter of pride that how ordinary people of our country are reaching this height without any suggestions.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma Awards every year, but in the last three years its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can choose any person.
Transparency has come in for complete process online.
In fact, the selection process of the awards has been completely transformed.
The Padma awards have been given to all those who are not seen on the occasion in big cities, on newspapers, on TV.
Now the significance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the individual in awarding.
Perhaps you have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta Ji.
He is producing toys from the things that have been thrown for four decades, so that the youngsters can become curious about science.
His efforts are to encourage youngsters to use scientific experiments from unnecessary materials.
For this, 3,000 schools in different parts of the country are inspiring youngsters by showing 18 language films.
One such story belongs to Sitaba Jodatti in Karnataka.
He is not called the Goddess of Empowerment of Women.
In the last three decades, in Belagavi, he has done great work to transform the lives of countless women.
He dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven, but then added his entire life for the welfare of the Devdasis.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Sham was born in a poor family and tribal family.
He was a little employed for leading a life but he was fond of creating traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is respected not only in India but also in the entire world for this hobby.
His portraits have been displayed in many countries like Turkey, Germany, England, Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shamji, who illuminated India abroad, has been recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award.
You will be surprised to hear the story of Laxmikutty, the tribal woman of Kerala.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in the Kollam area and is still in the hut in the tribal areas in the thick forests.
He made 500 medicines based on his memories.
He has skills in manufacturing snake bites.
Lakshmi ji is constantly serving people from her knowledge of this herbal medicine.
He was awarded Padmashri for his contribution to the society by identifying this unknown personality.
Today, I would like to mention another name. Subhashini Mistry, 75, West Bengal has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who has edited utensils at other people's homes to build a hospital and has sold vegetables.
When he was twenty-three years old, his husband died due to lack of medical treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals built by his hard work.
I am convinced that there are so many such jewels, ladies and gems in our brilliant jewels, which no one knows or knows.
Sometimes we should bring such people to school and college to know about their experiences.
There should be some effort in the society outside the prize.
My dear countrymen, every year on January 9, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is the day the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized a program wherein all the MPs and mayors of Indian origin residing in different parts of the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that Indian ethnic parliamentarians and mayors from Malaysia, Thailand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and many other countries have participated in this event.
Our Indian diaspora, who lives in different countries of Europe, is working on cybersecurity. Some are associated with Ayurveda, some are delighting the society with music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for the recognition of the Indian diaspora and through them to inform the people all over the world.
Worshipped Bapu Punya Tithi on January 30, who showed us all a new path.
These were not merely theories.
At present, we can see in every possible way how accurate Bapu's message was.
If we make a pledge that we should follow Bapu's path, what can be a bigger tribute than what we can do
My dear countrymen, I conclude by congratulating all of you for the two thousand eighteenth year.
Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This year's last episode of Mann Ki Baat is the end of this year and see the strange culmination of the year 2017.
This year, you and I have shared a lot of things for the past several years.
Your letters, comments and exchange of views on Mann Ki Baat always inspire me.
Years will change in a few hours, but this sustainability of our conversation will continue.
In the coming New Year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the festival of Holly Christmas was celebrated with fanfare all over the world.
The festival is celebrated with great joy throughout India.
During Christmas, we recognise the teachings and teachings of the Christian Christians, and the greatest emphasis was on Christianity.
The essence of this service is also reflected in the Bible.
Ramakrishna Paramhansadeva had also said, Serving life in the wisdom of Lord Shiva has all the human values all over the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
He has always inspired human beings like Gurus, poets, poets, great warriors.
He taught us to strive against injustice and atrocities, to free ourselves from the bonds of race and religion.
And in this endeavour, though he had lost a lot in his personal life, he never missed his feelings.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Let us pledge to draw inspiration from the teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his noble philosophy of life and to uphold his ideals in our lives.
You must be surprised to know that the New Year is coming every time and the Payyajanuari also comes every time. What is the need for a more special day
The entire India is eagerly looking forward to welcoming you to the 21st century debate.
You must be proud of yourselves as a voter of the 21st century.
The power of discourse is the greatest strength of democracy.
Because you too can play an important role in building India in the 21st century and it is going to start from the 1st century itself.
In this edition of Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to address a definite and definite youthful energy of 18-25 years of hygiene.
I believe that the dream of a New India will be realized by the strengths and capabilities of this youth full of vibrant energy.
The New India that we are talking about is a poison-free India of racism, communalism, terrorism and nepotism.
India is free from dirt and poverty.
New India, which will be a driver of peace, unity and goodwill.
Let us make a roadmap for ourselves, connect with those who are associated with you and let the team prosper and move forward.
How do we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, this is the need of the hour to make the dream of a 21st century beautiful and fruitful India a mass movement.
Today, several opportunities have been created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation Rentrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and successful.
I would like to assure you that you should think about how to get the news of these projects at some place of New India Youth and create such a system so that when you become eighteen years old you can easily know about all these things and make it necessary for him to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, I had talked about optimisticity in the previous Mann Ki Baat programme.
Nothing is impossible for a person who is positive and enthusiastic.
In English also, everyone said - Pacific Leadstook Wickness, Aptimism to Power.
In the previous Mann Ki Baat programme, I had urged the people of India to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am glad that people have shared their experiences in a large number of social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi Apps, extremely positive responses.
Lacs of targets including Positive India Hashtag have been achieved which has reached more than 150 million people.
The transmission of a fiscal demographic dividend has started in India and has spread all over the world.
The Twite Arresponse that came was really inspiring.
It was a pleasure.
Some Indians discussed the events that have had a positive impact on their minds this year.
Some people have shared their personal gains.
Soundbight  Minu Bhatia.
I live in Peacock Bihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
 My name is Jyoti Rajendra.
And he dies in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
The government was very beneficial for us and we were able to take care of the situation.
 My name is satisfying.
The National Highway was constructed in 2017 from different villages near our village.
Two of the events that our Indian soldiers have done - one of the surgical strikes carried out by the Pakistanis that dismantled the launching pads of the organisation and the paradigm of our Indian soldiers at Doklam was unparalleled.
 My name is Satish Bevani.
Over the last forty years, we have been dependent on the pipelines built for the Armed Forces.
Now we have a pipeline.
So in 2017, it's a big deal for us.
In a way, there are many people who have been working at their own level to bring about a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we all are building together.
Let us enter the year 2018 with all these small joys. We have launched the New Year and take concrete steps towards Positive India.
When we're all talking about politics, I'd like to share one thing.
I came to know about the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatak, the topper of the administrative service in Kashmir.
He came out of the brunt of wrestling and hate topped the examination of the Administrative Service of Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 the rebels burnt their ancestral homes.
There was so much violence and violence that his family had to leave their ancestral hut.
The atmosphere around a child was so violent that it was dark and terrible in the heart, but Anjum did not allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired by the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation is, it is also possible to destroy the clouds of despair through positive work.
Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting a few daughters from Jammu and Kashmir.
This is the strength of the country and the youth of our country. This is the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of the world's famous religious place in our country, it is very natural to have an analysis of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
Millions of devotees were present here every year in the blessings of Lord Ayyappaswamy at this world famous temple.
What kind of challenges can be faced by the cleanliness of such a place where such a vast number of people come here
And especially in those places that are situated between mountains and forests.
P.
Vijayan, a police officer named Poonam Punakavanam, started a cleanliness drive to spread awareness about cleanliness.
During his campaign, a pilgrimage will not be complete until a pilgrim who is giving some physical labour for cleanliness.
There are no minor differences in this campaign.
Every pilgrim is participating in some way or the other as a part of the worship of God.
Every morning this sanitation shows a strange sight and all the pilgrims participated in it.
He could be a celebrity or a blessed officer, or a simple pilgrim, everyone participated in the Punakavanam programme and had to move ahead with a clean sweep.
There are several such examples for the countrymen.
This Swachhta drive in Sabarimala was accomplished, Punam Punakavanam was successful and the pilgrims participated.
And we have sworn that when Bapu will be the 150th birth anniversary then we will do something or the other to give a Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made on a bank level across the country for transparency.
Changes are being noticed in the larger participation of people in rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan-2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to review the progress of Swachhta at the city level.
The programme will cover more than 40 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
The Swachhta App will provide analysis for revision of the user-service sector.
It will be seen that the habits of every citizen of the city are connected with the process of making the city clean and they become habits of the city.
My dear countrymen, some of these things seem to be very small from the point of view, but it becomes far-reaching in a society.
Today, I would like to mention one such incident in Mann Ki Baat.
Is this injustice done to Muslim women for decades
He has not given rights to Muslim women in our country.
I am very happy that our government has focused on this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken urgent steps in this regard and this 70-year-old tradition has changed and disrupted it.
Today, a Muslim woman will be able to go for Haj without Maharam and I am glad that about 1300 Muslim women have applied for Haj and Muslim women from different parts of the country have expressed their desire to go for Haj from Kerala to North India.
I suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that the women who want to go to Haj alone get permission from the Ministry of Minority Affairs.
Our efforts will be to enable our women to get equal rights and equal opportunities to take part in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day of our country.
But, 26th January, 2018 will have to be remembered very well.
This has never happened in India's history.
The year 2017 was remarkable for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and in 2017 India completed 25 years of its partnership with ASEAN countries.
It is a matter of pride for us that the world's ten great leaders have met together on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of the festival, however, our country is a country of economy.
Perhaps there's no day when there's no mountain.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, coming back to New Year.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
We all move ahead with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolves and the country also move forward.
In January, the sunrise was celebrated and Makar Sankranti was celebrated.
It's a paradigm related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our mountains is somehow related to natural disasters, but in our culture full of diversity, these incidents of nature are different.
All these mountains are grown from 13th to 17th January.
The names of these mountains are different, but in its depths the same is the combination of nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There is perhaps no one in India who does not remember or respect him.
He is a witness to all of us, the sacrifices and sacrifices made by our country.
On September 28, he completed ninety years.
I was fortunate to have a phone call with Didi before my foreign visit.
This conversation was exactly the same as a younger brother had spoken to his elder sister with utmost respect.
Modi ji: Latadi, salute.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Lataji: Salute.
I called for this because this time on your birthday (Lataji yes yes) Modi ji: I will be busy travelling by air.
I will be back on 28th tonight and on 29th morning it will be your birthday.
Okay, okay.
Lataji: Many are older in age, but one who grows up with his work is getting a big blessing.
Yes, but I believe that this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all the listeners.
Modi ji...
I am even happier when you proudly say that your mother was Gujarati.
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore, because I can see and know how busy you are and how much you have.
How much to think.
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I sent someone to her, to see her blessings.
My mother was very happy and your love shows me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yeah, yeah, of course
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the festival will once again be filled with new zeal and resolve.
It's the season of the festival
It will continue to be a joyous and glorious festival throughout the country for several weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of this festival.
And this is what we call darkness in the bottom of lamp.
Perhaps this proverb is not just a word, it's a direction for us, a philosophy, a motivation.
Just imagine, some houses are lighted on one side.
On the other hand, there are some people in the neighbourhood.
Sweets are destroyed in some houses, and some children are fond of sweets.
At least the extra or unserved items of the house can be delivered out.
Startups of young NGO friends are doing this in many cities.
They collect people's clothes, sweets, food from their homes, then discover the bad-fathers and quietly take them to their homes.
Can we take the darkness of lamps with full awareness and determination during this festive season
Laxmi was welcomed in the traditional tradition.
In our culture, girls are considered as Laxmis because women bring good fortune and prosperity.
This year, can we have a universal programme to honour girls in our society, in villages and cities
Can we honour these Laxmis of India in this Diwali
There are many daughters and many brides around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Some people are working to educate the poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as doctors and engineers and some are trying to ensure justice to others.
May our society take pride in these girls in their recognition and honour.
They should be honoured across the country.
One more thing you can do is share the glory of these girls on social media as much as you can and use hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
Just like we all carried out a massive campaign called Selfie with Daughter, which was spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, I have said this thing earlier that I have got the opportunity to talk directly or indirectly to a large number of familiar and familiar people.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayang, sent me a very interesting letter.
I'm Roing, from Arunachal Pradesh.
I love reading, I think it would be very useful for me to read before the book test.
I liked a lot of things from this book, but I also noticed that there is a lot of suggestions for students in this book but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
Then see, my young friends have the belief that if we talk about something then it will certainly happen.
My little student friend, thank you for writing letters first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors two-three times.
If I take time for a new version, I will try to write a few words for your parents and teachers.
But I'm gonna make an appeal to all of you.
Can you help me
I must consider them.
And I will certainly try to write in my own language, in my own way.
Even if your suggestions come in large numbers, my new version will also be confirmed.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you are well aware of the Prime Minister's busy schedule through newspapers and television.
But you all know that I am a common man like you.
I also heard that speech and watched the match.
The simplicity and conversion of the 23-year-old Daniel Medivev is like affecting everyone.
I must be impressed.
Shortly before that speech, he won a 19-time Grandslam winner and a final at Legend Rafael Nadal, Tennessee.
In that situation, someone else would be sorry and disappointed.
He lauded his competitors for losing the finals and setting a bright example of Sportsman Spirit.
Champion Nadal also appreciated the game of Daniel.
The morale of the sportspersons in the same match and the humility of the sportsperson is both instructive.
If you don't listen to Daniel Medivech's speech, I would definitely urge everyone, especially the youth to watch that video.
It has a lot to learn for people of all ages.
There are moments that go beyond losing, these moments teach us no meaning to losing.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say is only for your good.
Discussions, arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments, but the issue should be resolved before the issue is diluted.
Otherwise the problem takes a bigger form and solving it becomes a terrible thing.
A lot can be saved if we are conscious of the root.
With this feeling, I feel that my young friends must talk about an urgent issue.
We all know the extent to which tobacco is harmful to health and it is difficult to quit once it becomes rude.
Tobacco ironicotine makes it intoxicating.
Consumption of tobacco during childhood also damages the growth of brain.
We all know about these things, but today I want to inform you about a new topic.
You know, a ban on e-cigarette has been issued recently in India.
This e-cigarette is an electrical instrument different from the normal cigarette.
E-cigarette warms the nicotine-containing liquid material and creates a chemical smoke through which nicotine enters the body.
We are aware of the danger of ordinary cigarettes, but there is a misconception about e-cigarettes that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used to prevent stinks like ordinary cigarettes.
We are naturally watching the chain smoker in a family so that no one else in the family smokes.
And to keep the little ones from Chanbari cigarettes away from biri.
There is no smoke about the cigarettes, those who are selling, those who are buying or watching are aware that the cigarette is harmful.
But e-cigarette matters are different.
There's very little awareness about this.
The common man is not aware of the harmful side of e-cigarette and this is why the household has entered the dedicated e-cigarette.
Sometimes, in the family, children are showing magic in front of their parents, without fire, without smoke, without smoke, they eat e-cigarette and the elders applaud it.
You know, we smell it when someone around us smells cigarettes.
Even a pocket of cigarettes is smelled.
But it doesn't happen in e-cigarettes, be it the youth knowing, be it the unconscious or the fashion statement, they rotate in their bags, in their books or in their hands with pride, so they fall into the clutches of intoxication.
Youth power is the future of our country.
E-cigarette obstacles were imposed so that these new instruments of intoxication do not ruin our country, not destroy the dreams of the family, not destroy the lives of the children.
Somehow this drug cannot be rooted in the society.
I urge all of you, abandon the illusions of tobacco and stop misleading concepts about e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India is not just going to the gym every morning and evening for two hours.
It is also called Fit India to avoid all these misunderstandings.
I believe you don't want to worry about me, it'll be better.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace of such great personalities who have laid down their lives not for themselves but for others.
Our India, this land of ours, is a land of versatility.
Many human jewels have gifted this country.
It is a matter of pride for our nation that a human soul is going to be honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
On that day, Pope Francis is going to announce a cent to Marium Thresia.
Sister Marium Threasia has made immense contributions to human welfare in the short span of fifty years.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mariam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially my Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that today when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, at the same time 130 crore Indians have resolved to completely stop the use of Single Use Plastic.
The way India has played a leading role in conserving the environment, the attention of the entire world is now on India.
I am confident that all of you will join the Single Use Plastic campaign on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this movement in their own way at different places.
However, one of the youngsters of our country has started a unique campaign.
His work attracts my attention and I talk to him on the phone and try to know and understand his new plans.
Perhaps his words will be useful to other people of the country.
When I first heard the word plogging, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word is used in small quantities abroad.
Hello, Rippudaman ji, I am Narendra Modi ji.
With this, we will not only take care of our own health but we will also be able to protect the health of mother Earth.
I believe that 130 crore Indians will move ahead with the objective of making India free of single use plastic.
Rippu Daman ji, thank you very much again
My dear countrymen, preparations are going on all over the country and around the world on 2nd October, but we want to take the path of Gandhi 150.
We want to develop our lives for the welfare of the country.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is our dream and that is why every year on 31st October, we organize a Run for Unity across the country.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you would go to 15 places of India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there for a night.
See, understand, feel India.
How varied we have.
Whenever there is a holiday on the occasion of Deepawali then everyone goes for a walk, so I request you to visit 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has made a lot of progress in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and this has been possible due to your cooperation.
It's possible to understand the importance of traveling in particular.
That is, we have moved ahead at this time and if we try even more then we can make a place in the tourism sector in the world before the completion of 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of this diverse India.
You must also see that on the days of Deepawali there is no fire or any human damage due to fire.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, greet you all
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Diwali, 'Palit Mahaparav Chot' is one of the best rules and regulations in our country.
From Khadwa to Khadwa, every subject is celebrated in tradition.
Chhath Puja is completely connected with the unparalleled nature and worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water, the worship centre of the Mahaparabachat, on the other hand, bamboo and earthen vessels and roots, are the common items related to the worshipping process.
The expression of the importance of cleanliness in our lives is also inherent in this.
The cleanliness of the entire village, along with rivers, ponds and nearby areas of Khankhand, the cleanliness of the shrines, and the fertileness of the valleys, all the people join hands with the fervour.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja - Conservation of the environment, Prevention of Disease and Discipline
There is also a logic behind the prasad Sea Meal which destroys the ego and this egoistic feeling that hinders the progress of the person.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has tied up with the people of the country.
Take the examples of Khadi and Handloom.
You must be pleased to hear that Khadi and Handloom are sold so much in one store.
The sale of Khadi gift coupons during Deepawali has increased by almost 600 percent.
The total volume of Khadi and handicrafts has also increased by nearly ninety percent this year compared to the previous year.
It is visible that today young people, old people, women, every age-old person likes mankind and handlooms.
I can imagine how many families, poor families and handloom families have benefitted from it.
And we have talked about Khadi for Fashion but in the past few years, I can say from my heart that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, Khadi for Transformation is now taking that place.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful instrument to transform the lives of the poorest of the poor and to empower the poorest of the poor.
He's playing a very big role for Gramodhi.
Shri Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he wanted to know about my experience of Diwali with the Defence Forces and he also wanted to know how Deepawali was administered by the Army.
Tejas Solihwad-O Narendra Modi App has written: What can our housing sweets also reach the defence forces
We also think of our brave defence forces.
We also believe that the sweetness of our home must reach out to our soldiers.
You all must have spent Deepawali very hard.
Deepawali has come with a special experience for me.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces once again.
This time, Deepavali with the Armed Forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir has become an unforgettable experience for me.
On behalf of the people of our country, I salute every soldier of our defence forces for the sake of their valour, dedication and sacrifice to protect the nation from the difficult situation in the border.
When we get the opportunity, when we get the opportunity, we need to know about the experiences of our soldiers, we should narrate their glory.
Many of us do not know that our defence forces are playing a vital role not only at the borders but also at the world level.
As United Nations Peacekeeping Forces, they are shining India across the globe.
Just a few days ago, on 24th October, United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
They remember the positive role played by the United Nations in establishing peace in the world.
And we follow VasudhaivaKutumbakam. The whole world is our family.
And from the beginning, India has contributed actively to the United Nations in various important initiatives.
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter, both of these words begin with the words The Piple.
India has always emphasized on equal rights for women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
The initial text of the proposal was All Main and Burn Free Equale, which has been reversed by the Indian representative Hansa Mehta, followed by Allhuman Beings and Burn Free and Equal.
Though this seems to be a small change, we can see a healthy thinking in it.
India has made one of the most important contributions in UN peacekeeping.
India has always played a major role in the United Nations Peace Education Mission.
There are some people amongst you who might have known this information for the first time.
Over eighteen thousand Defence Forces have contributed to the UN peacekeeping operations.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the United Nations Peacekeeping Entrepreneurship and this is the third highest in the world.
Till August 2017, about 50 of the world's seventy-seven peacekeeping efforts have contributed.
All these efforts are being carried out in different parts of the world like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan etc.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated and rescued at the Indian Army Hospital in Kango and South Sudan.
The Indian Defence Force has not only protected the people of different countries but has also conquered their minds by trying to preserve peace.
Indian women have played a leading role in the peace process.
Very few people know that India is the first country to send women police units to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in Liberia.
And see, this move of India has since become an inspiration for all the countries.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not limited to peacekeeping but also training the Peacekeeping Forces of 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers are spreading the message of peace and goodwill across the world from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha.
The peace-security drive is not easy.
Our Defence Forces work in the inaccessible areas of the Armed Forces.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of the people of India are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeeping Forces who have also received special recognition for their work in Cyprus.
In 1984, at the age of 72, he was appointed Army Commander in Namibia, who served as the Chief of Staff to ensure independence of Namibia.
Former Chief of the Army Staff, General Themayya, led the UN Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus and distinguished himself from peace and security.
India has always been an ambassador of peace, a message of peace, unity and goodwill.
Our belief is to lead a peaceful and harmonious life and to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, this virtuous land of India is immensely embraced by such great personalities whose lives have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Velves, Honourable Bhagini Nivedita, is one of these exceptional dignitaries.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland and later named him Swamibekananda Nivedita.
'Nivedita' means dedication to the nation.
Later he showed the excellent glory of his name.
Yesterday marked the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the welfare of the poor and the distressed.
Sister Nivedita, the oppressor of the British Raj, suffered a lot.
The British tried to force Indians to become slaves, not just physically but also mentally.
Efforts were always made to keep our culture low and deprived.
Bhagini Nivedita re-established the glory of Indian culture.
Inspired by national consciousness, awakened and helped people to unite.
He travelled across the globe to protest against the spread of traditional religions and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will remain an inspiration for her eloquent poem 'Pudum Penn,' NewWomen and 'Nari Sashaktikaran'.
It is said that Bhagni Nivedita was the source of inspiration for this.
The great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose was also helped by Bhaginivedita in various ways.
Through his writings and conventions, Shri Basur was very helpful in both publications and publications of examinations.
This is a wonderful co-existence of India where the spirituality and science of our culture are complementary to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In 1899, in the city of Calcutta, in the face of the horrific plague, Shaw descends into death.
Sister Nivedita, neglecting his health, has come forward in Rastaghat and Dharma Safai campaigns.
This is the woman who gave up luxury, pleasure and sacrificed herself for the poor and the deprived.
Sister Nivedita, who has given her everything, is here to relax.
It's certainly the truth.
This will be our rightful tribute to this legendary personality if every Indian learns from his life and follows his path of service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important parts of New India, the heroes of tomorrow.
Your anxiety is relevant and the diseases which were previously seen in the old age are now being seen in childhood.
It's astonishing to hear, but it's true that children are also victims of diabetes these days.
But now our lifestyle has changed a lot.
Today, these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main cause of all these diseases in young age is lack of physical work and change in food habits.
Both the society and the family need to pay attention to it.
There is no need for unusual or dangerous changes.
What is needed is to concentrate on small matters and make them in their own habits.
I would like the people of the family to be conscious so that children become habituated to sports in the open.
If possible, the elders of the family should also join them.
Children should be used to stairs instead of lifts.
After dinner, the whole family should walk with the kids.
Yoga will help us create a habit of healthy lifestyle and save our youth from lifestyle disorder.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can only be taught.
No specific instrument or field.
Several examinations are underway to ensure effective diabetes control.
A lot of work has been done in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very promising.
Ayurveda and yoga should not only be considered as the ways of elimination of diseases but should also be a part of everyday life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy in the last few days from the world of sports.
There is good news for India in badminton like Hawki.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the Denmark Open and made every Indian proud.
After Indonesian Open and Australian Olympics, this is his third superstitious victory.
I congratulate this youngster for his success and for Indias glory.
Friends, this month FIFA Under-17 World Cup is organised.
Teams from various countries of the world have come to India to participate in it and their sporting skills have fascinated us.
I had a chance to see a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic from the players.
World Cup is a big event, where the world is watching you.
I was surprised to see the enthusiasm, zeal and enthusiasm of the young athletes.
The World Cup was organized successfully and successfully and all the teams showed their best skills.
Even if India does not win the Golden Jubilee, Indias sportspersons have won the hearts of everyone.
India and the entire world have enjoyed the Festival and the football tournaments for football lovers.
The future of football is bright and forecast.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, if I have to deal with all the people who have come here in the matter of Swachh Bharat, I will have to do Mann Ki Baat every day and I will have to discuss the cleanliness of Mann Ki Baat.
Youngsters are showcasing the efforts of small children and the success of Team Fort is somewhere.
Innovation is happening somewhere with transparency. This time, the zeal for the work of an officer becomes new.
A few days ago, I got a major port, where there is a description of the renovation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of an NGO named Ecological Protection Organization (EPO) had carried out a clean sweep campaign at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
And I was surprised to see that those who have been exposed to the garbage around them, the foul smelling atmosphere, they can see the picture of this Chandrapur Fort, I would like to tell them how the hard work, resolve, insistence and vigilance of the youngsters of the Ecological Protection Organisation have been reflected.
They're gonna disappoint you, disbelief.
This Bhagirath effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collaboration and commitment.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all the people of the country to protect and preserve the historic resources.
I would like to thank all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the residents of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on 4th November.
Guru Nanakshudhu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire mankind and proclaimed equality of all nations and communities.
He stressed on the importance of self-respect and empowerment of women.
Guru Nanak Dev has travelled 228 thousand kilometers and has spread the message of humanity in this journey.
He has joined people and guided them to the path of honesty, sacrifice and devotion.
He didn't just say that he did it in his life and in his work.
He unveiled a plaque to mark the commencement of a service to the people.
At the same time, the consumption of food in the lanterns creates unity and equity.
Guru Nanak has asked for three means of a successful life, chant the name of God, enjoy labour and help the persecuted.
Guru Nanak also composed Gurubani for his propaganda.
550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us try to move ahead with his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he was the guiding principle of a unbroken modern India.
We can learn a lot from the extraordinary life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had worked as an integral part of India.
I had ensured that crores of Indians were enshrined in the shadow of One Nation, One Constitution.
His discretion gave him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
He has set a goal and he has moved ahead with that goal.
He used to say, "Anyone can do the same thing to the country, who dreams of a nation where everyone has equal rights."
I would like this message of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel to always inspire us.
He said that we cannot change the differences between nations and communities. Every man and woman in India should define the future of love and mutual love and goodwill.
Sardar Saheb's words are still the inspiration and strength of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
The contribution of the individual to our nation is unforgettable.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, Run for Unity will be organised across the country, wherein children, women, youth and elderly people will be involved.
I urge you all to participate in the good spirit of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali vacations, you people have come back with your resolutions and new dedication to your daily routine.
My best wishes to all the people of the country to fulfil their dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
Three years have been completed to do Mann Ki Baat through All India Radio.
Today is the 36th edition.
Most of them encourage me.
And I would like to take you half an hour in a month but on the 30th day people start talking about Mann Ki Baat.
And what has happened because of this thing is that the government is also sensitivity and the strength of the society is being given to them in such a way that they are concentrating on it.
Therefore, this three year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of Indians- their thinking and their feelings.
And perhaps, I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to share the emotions of the common man in such a short span of time.
I often remember Acharya Vinoba Bhave in Mann Ki Baat.
Acharya used to say Binoba often, non-governmental, effective.
I am sure, three years later, social scientists, universities, researchers, media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this analysis will be of immense use for Mann Ki Baat in future and it will provide a new consciousness and a new spirit.
And when I had said this thing in Mann Ki Baat, we should think about it while eating, we should not waste it as much as we need.
But then I have seen that so many letters have been received from every corner of the country, so many social organizations and several newcomers have been doing this work for a long time.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I see the Selfie with Daughter of a Panchayat Chief in Haryana and I am putting it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
A massive campaign of selfie with dotters was launched not only in India but also across the world.
Just a few days ago, I was sitting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Send photographs wherever you go to an incredible in India.
Millions of pictures from every corner of India have become a big resource for those who have worked in the field of tourism.
I have experienced this thing in Mann Ki Baat that how small things create a mass movement.
Today I feel like it is because when I think it's been three years, I have been feeling a lot of things in the last three years.
The country is moving forward every moment to take the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of others, for the betterment of society and for the betterment of the country.
In my three years journey of Mann Ki Baat, I have learned it from the people of the country.
For any country, this is a big resource, a big strength.
And I've seen a lot of attraction for the Khadi recently, and I've naturally said that no one has to read Khadi.
But there are so many fabrics, why not Khadi
And it looks like the younger generation has been attracted to Khadi.
Khadi sales have grown and there is a direct link between the livelihoods of the poor.
On 2nd October Khadi was released, a lot of discounts were made.
Once again, I would like to say that the campaign for Khadi is being carried forward.
We work with this feeling that we will lit the lamp of Deepawali in the houses of the poor by buying Khadi.
The poor of our country will get a boost from this and we should do that.
And to increase the interest in Khadi, the Khadi sector employees and the Khadi people of the Government of India have been encouraged to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar energy and handlooms
How to revive the old tradition that had been closed for nearly 20, 25 and 30 years
A Khadi Ashram at Sevapur in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Various methods have been added.
Several people have got new employment opportunities.
The Khadi and Village Industries Training Centre, which was closed in Pompore in Kashmir, has been resumed and Kashmir has a lot to offer.
Now, for the resumption of this Training Centre, the new generation has been getting the help of modernizing the work, developing new things and I am glad that the presents given by the big corporate houses during Deepawali have started offering Khadi items.
People are giving each other khadi as gifts.
We are all feeling the way things are moving simply.
My dear countrymen, we had collectively made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we had decided to celebrate the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti in the entire country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President has started this work and the country has joined it.
Old, underprivileged, ladies and gentlemen, every village has become a part of the cleanliness drive today.
When I talk about accomplishing our resolutions, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is progressing on the path of solemn pledge.
I'm observing that some people are doing the job of applying.
This time we have seen one more thing - first of all, we will clean one place and secondly it may be that we will not waste any place consciously but if we have to make cleanliness a habit then there is a need for a revolutionary change in our thinking.
Several competitions were organised in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign this year.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the competition on Swachhata.
Thousands of children are painting.
He has drawn his own vision of Swachhta.
Whenever it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the media persons.
We are witnessing Swachhata Hi Seva movement in the country's electronic media and print media.
A few days ago, I was attracted to the young Bilal Dar, 18, from Srinagar.
From 12-13 years of age to 5-6 years of age, Bilateral Swachhata has been working on it.
Asia's largest lake near Srinagar also cleanses plastic, polythene, useful bottles, garbage.
I am glad that not only did the Brand Ambassador get it constructed, they gave it to Bilal, they gave it a uniform, they also educated the people of other areas about cleanliness, inspired them and they did not give up until they got the desired results.
Bilal Dar is young but is inspiring for those who are interested in cleanliness.
I convey my best wishes to Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk about history then it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is the month to remember many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, several great personalities were born in the month of October, who led us in the centuries and the 21st century, showed us the path and those who had suffered a lot for the country.
When former President of India, Mr. Abdul Kalam ji spoke to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He spoke of the programme with deep dedication and went to the village to witness the work of Danaji himself.
Remembering these great men, we remember them so that we can find a way forward so that the right direction can be given to the future.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
We keep saying it very easily - unity between diversity is India's specialty.
We are proud of diversity and are proud of diversity. Have we ever tried to feel our diversity
I want to tell all my countrymen in India, especially my young generation, that we are in an awakening situation.
Feel the diversity of India, touch her and appreciate her pride.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't mind but sometimes you will also look at your house.
The people of North India will not know what is in South India
The people of western India don't know what is in Eastern India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, all of them travelled to India, there was a new inspiration to see and understand the country and to live for the country.
All these great men have seen this country in a big way.
They have tried to know and understand India at the beginning of their work.
We have tried to make India self-reliant.
Isn't it possible for us to learn different states, different societies or communities, their traditions, their dresses, food habits as a student, to understand, to acquire lifestyle
Value addition in tourism will happen only when we will try to accept, understand and incorporate the characteristics of these places, not just as a spectator but as a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of my own Hindustan.
It has also been experienced to spend the night in more than 4,500 districts.
Today, when I take charge of this important responsibility of the country, the experience of this journey is extremely useful for me.
That's why I have the advantage of understanding many things.
I also urge you to realise this treasure of universal energy, not just because of the slogan of unity in diversity in India.
If one type of new food is eaten every day for the entire life then it will not be repeated.
This is the strength of our tourism.
I would like you all to come out of your house on this vacation for a bit of change.
Your thoughts will be enormous.
What could be a greater teacher than realisation
In general, the time from October to March is ready for tourism.
If you meet the people there then send them photos too.
Write not only about its architecture but also about its natural beauty.
Please send the best essays on your tour to MyGov and send them to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen one thing that if you are the best tourist destination in your state for the betterment of India's tourism industry then every Indian should know about these seven things of your state.
If possible, we'll have to go to those seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You see, if everybody in the same state sends these information, then I will tell the government to scrutiny them and to make public the seven common issues that came from every state.
That is, how a tourist destination can be developed in a way.
Similarly, if you want to see the seven things that you have seen throughout the country, you want to see them or anyone should go there then you must send the names of these seven places of your choice in MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on this thing.
The government will accept the issue of making films, making videos, making propaganda literature, giving excellence to those places that will be good for you.
Come, join me.
You can also be a major facilitator in the development of tourism during the month of October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, for being a human being, a lot of things touch my mind and hinder my mind.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps your eyes too were attracted. The countrymen saw a wonderful example of Nari Shakti and Patriotism.
The Indian Army has got two brave heroes named Lieutenants Swati and Nidhi.
That is why Swati and Nidhi Swami had sacrificed their lives in the service of Mother Bharati.
We can imagine how the world will be ruined at this young age
But Martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, wife of Mahadik, fought this difficult situation and took this decision and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to realise the dream of his husband.
In a similar way, Nidhi Dubey, her husband Mukesh Dubey served as the hero in the army and when she was martyred for her motherland, her wife Nidhi decided in her mind and she also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to pay homage to this woman power, to our brave hearts.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
They have created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for crores of people of the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, in the midst of Navratri festivals and Deepawali, this time is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA Under-17 is getting us here.
I believe that soccer resonates in Chaudhari.
Each generation will get an attraction for football.
There will be no school-college ground in India where our youngsters will not be able to play football.
Come, when the whole world is coming to play on the soil of India, we too have made this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire environment is filled with holy smell.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen, pray to the mother power and let our country achieve new heights of success in fulfilling the aspirations and aspirations of the people of the country.
May the country be able to overcome every challenge.
May the country progress at a rapid pace and in the year 2022, when India will complete 75 years of its independence, we have started our journey by creating a 5-year road map to fulfil the resolutions and resolves of 125 crore Indians.
My best wishes to you all.
Celebrate the festival and enhance the spirit.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel who dedicated his heart to the unity of the nation.
From ancient times, the universal values, non-violence and harmony our ancestors have nurtured with our lives.
Ahimsa Param Dharma - we have been hearing this since childhood.
I had said from the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, it can be communal belief, it can be a belief in political ideology or a person can believe in any tradition in any case violence will not be tolerated.
No one has the right to take over the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar had passed has ensured the right to get justice for every individual.
I assure the countrymen that the government or the country will not allow anyone who goes on the path of violence against the people who have been enacted by the law.
Everyone must be bowed to the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Our festivals are directly linked to farmers and fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival. First of all, I would like to tell you about your Fisheries.
Yesterday, the festival of Sambasthri of Jain community was celebrated.
In the Jain Samaj, Parva was celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Celebrations are symbols of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also known as the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other as Machami Dukkadam.
Besides, our scriptures have the husting of forgiveness heroes.
My dear countrymen, now Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great zeal and enthusiasm.
And when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi then the issue of Ganesh Utsav comes naturally.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi has been going on for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and piety.
I convey my best wishes to the people of our country on this occasion.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the major festivals of Kerala in the splendid festivals of India.
The festival is renowned for its social and cultural importance.
Onam Utsav reminds one of Keralas rich cultural heritage.
And now this festival has become a centre of tourism attraction.
Besides, I would also like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navaratri or the Durgotsava of West Bengal has become the main attraction of tourism today.
There is a lot of scope for attracting foreigners in other festivals of our country.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Id-ul-uha will be celebrated in this joyous festival.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all fellow citizens.
Festivals and cleanliness are intimately linked to our family life.
Preparations for the Festival begin with cleanliness.
This is not new, but it is important to make cleanliness socially.
Universally, Swachhata is not only our home, but also in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country.
My dear countrymen, the way to become modern is changing steadily.
Today, this new dimension has become a new parameter.
In YouTube, you will see that these days children are constructing statues of Ganesha with soil at home.
The Swachhata Abhiyan, which was launched three years ago, will mark the third anniversary of October 2nd.
At a time, officials of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind have taken up the task of cleaning and sanitation of 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods in Dhanarai district of Banaskantha in Gujarat.
Where can our country be reached if this effort for cleanliness becomes a permanent part of our nature
My dear countrymen, let me invite you once again, once again, on the 2nd of October, we started the campaign of Swachhata Hi Seva on 15-20 days of Gandhi Jayanti, just as it was said earlier, Jal Seva is Prabhu Seva and Swachhata Hi Seva is the same.
We create an environment conducive to cleanliness throughout the country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we should look for opportunities and utilize them.
Shramdaan.
Work collectively on holidays or Sundays.
Go to the neighbouring villages, go to the nearby villages, give them a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat chiefs to create an atmosphere and create a clean environment 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mygov.
in, where you can enroll yourself and your family names after making toilets, whom you have helped.
Friends from social media can launch creative campaigns in the virtual world that can actually be inspiring.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation may organise essays, short films and film drawing competitions under Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi campaign.
You can write essays in different languages and this competition has no specific age.
Out of the participants, 3 at the district level and 3 at the state level will be selected and awarded.
I urge you to take part in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions of listeners and millions of people sometimes send message or communicate on the phone, send a message which is a supreme receipt and rare resource for me.
It is a great opportunity for me to know about the feelings and minds of the people of the country.
I wait for more information than you wait for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I'm eagerly waiting because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, hear, read and know your opinion as much as possible.
Prime Minister, I call Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a girlfriend of mine.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a bad idea I'm surprised to see.
I was once in a mall with him for shopping.
I saw him buy a sari of two thousand rupees, spending Rs 450 for a pizza uninterruptedly.
At the same time, it has been requested for a period of five rupees with Autowala to move to Mall.
He did the same thing while buying vegetables on his way back and saved four-five rupees.
I felt so bad.
We spend a lot of money in big shops, but we don't believe in the amount of money that we spend for our labourer brothers and sisters.
I believe that after listening to this phone, you have not just awakened, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
You dont think that whenever someone comes around our house to sell the goods, whenever he comes to sell it, he comes to sell it, he comes to sell it with a small shopkeeper or a vegetable seller, sometimes he needs to do it with an auto-rickshaw.
And when people like us go to some big restaurant to eat, don't see what's written in the bill, I'll take out the money immediately.
Not only this, if you buy a sari in a showroom, I do not miss it, but if you work with a poor person, you dont leave it.
There will be no difference in your life for two rupees and five rupees but have you ever wondered how deep your behavior hits him
Madam, I'm grateful to you. You called me a heartfelt message.
I believe that if my countrymen have this habit of treating the poor, they will certainly abandon it.
My dear young friends, the entire country celebrates the 29th August as National Sports Day.
It is the birthday of the great hockey player and the wizard Major Dhyanchand ji of Haqi.
His contribution to Haqqi is incredible.
I am reminded of this thing because I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Let sports become part of our lives.
If we are the youngest nations in the world, we should also look at the field of sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement.
Sports is an excellent invitation to reconcile the heart.
Let the young generation of our country come forward in the field of sports and today in the era of computers, I would like to educate them that the flying field is more important than the play station.
Play a song on the computer, but sometimes even in the field outside show a football.
Perhaps the cricket player in the computer, but in the open field, under the sky, playing cricket is a different joy.
Today, the situation is such that when the kids return home, they start watching a cartoon movie or they get into a mobile game... then the mother has to shout and say - when will you go out
Time changes, he was an age when the mother told the boy when you were coming and today it was like telling the mother, Dad, when will you go out
Friends, The Ministry of Sports has set up a Sports Talent Search Portal for the development of sports talent where any child from all over the country has a talent for sports which can upload his bio-data or video on the portal.
The Sports Ministry will provide training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry will launch it tomorrow.
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youngsters that from 6th to 28th October, India will be hosting the Under Seventeen World Cup.
Twenty-four teams of the world are going to make India their home.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from the world to the sporting festival and enjoy sports and create a conducive environment in the country.
Today, when I talk about sports, I am reminded of a touching event of last week, I would like to share it with my countrymen.
I and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas, who never had a connection with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy, their emotions and their inspiration will inspire us all.
I-NS Tarini with these six daughters and a small boat will be able to cross the sea.
This campaign has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India several months after the world tour.
Sometimes it'll be forty days in water.
Sometimes you spend thirty days together in water.
Our six brave daughters in the waves of the sea, and this is the first such incident in the world.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of our daughters.
I salute the feelings of these girls and I have asked them to share their thoughts with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their ideas on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because, in a way, it's brave, it's about your own thinking, and I'm glad to take these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters and blessings of waves.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day.
Radhakrishnan ji was the birth anniversary of the former President of our country.
He was the President, but for the rest of his life he made himself a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a life dedicated to education.
The great qualities of a teacher are instilling in his students the spirit of creation and enlightenment.
Can I start a mission mode
The way the mothers of the family are reminded of the role of teachers in the society will be remembered in the same way.
Teachers play a big role in transformation.
Every teacher has a transformational technique in his life and we make every effort in a holistic manner.
It will play a major role in the country's transformation.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Teach to Transform'.
My name is Dr. Avina Awasthi.
I am associated with the Indian Research Centre, a resident of Mumbai and Howard University.
The scheme was started with a dream on 28th August, 2014.
Tomorrow, 28th August will mark three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
30 crore Indians participated in this scheme and opened their first bank account.
The number of new Accountant Citizens is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you have money in your house or in your pocket, you can concentrate on bad expenditure.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the poor people of our country have deposited nearly Rs. 65 thousand crores.
Again, those who opened the accounts under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also got the benefit of insurance.
Today, a new self-confidence has been created in the lives of the poor with just one rupee and three rupees premium on Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.
The benefits of a premium that has been distressed by the poor and the head of the family has died.
I have been told about the benefits of Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, insurance etc.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
The minds of people are such that rainy season is very enjoyable for people.
Animals, birds, animals, animals and nature- everyone enjoys the advent of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible look, it shows how much the destructive power is.
Nature is our lifelong, our nurturer, but sometimes the floods, the natural fortunes like the earthquake, its splendid forms of destruction.
This change in the weather cycle and the change in the environment has a negative impact.
Over the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to heavy rains.
The flood affected areas are being monitored closely.
Rescue is being carried out extensively.
My colleagues in the Council of Ministers are reaching wherever possible.
The state government is also trying its best to help the people affected by floods.
Social organizations, cultural organisations, citizens desirous of serving are making every effort to reach out to the people in this situation.
It has an impact on agriculture, animals, infrastructure, roads, power and connectivity.
In particular, for the loss of crops and farms to our farmer brothers, we have formulated a scheme so that the farmers can play a positive role in the insurance companies, especially the agriculture insurance companies.
People are talking about their own misery.
Before the rainy season, the entire government programme was prepared by mock drills in most places.
The team of NDRF was appointed.
Gradually, we have also developed such a way that according to the forecast of the rains, we will work in a way that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country who are more than me.
This time there have been so many letters regarding GST, so many phones have been received, and people are still glad about GST and asking questions.
I would like to call you Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I am deeply impressed by your speech at the Chartered Accountants Day.
Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched in our country on this day last month.
I'd like to hear your opinion on this.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month since the launch of GST and its beneficial results are visible.
And I am glad that whenever a poor man writes a letter telling us how the prices of goods for the poor have come down, how things have become cheaper.
A person residing in the North-East, Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-From-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-Far-
Business has become simpler.
And most importantly, the confidence of the consumers is increasing.
Now I see the impact of GST on transport logistics sector.
How the truck moved up.
As a result, a strong smooth transition is being carried out so that migration and registration are being carried out in a very strong way and this is creating a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, through the research of economists, management scholars, technological scholars, India will certainly convert the use of GST into a model for the world.
This will become a Case Study for different universities of the world.
This is the reason that such a massive change is being brought about in such a big way, the contribution of such millions of people, its experimentation and successful development in such a vast country.
The world must do research on this.
GST has been rolled out, every state has participated in it and every state has a responsibility in it.
All decisions have been taken together by all the States and Centres in a consensus manner.
And as a result, the primary objective of every government is to ensure that there is no pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, all the central and state government employees associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of Indias overall energy success.
It's the same historical achievement.
This is a campaign of social reforms.
Once again I salute crores of Indians for making such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
Our new generation of scholars, what happened on August 9, 1942
How the people of India united themselves with the aspirations of freedom from 1857 to 1942, how much they had to endure and how much they had to endure.
It was at that time when people from every corner of India, every corner of the city and every corner of the country, educated, illiterate, poor and needy, fell shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the uit India movement.
At the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians dedicated their lives to the battle of Karenge Ya Marenge.
After the call of Mahatma Gandhi uit India Movement on 9th August, Dr.
Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan, other generations of leaders.
Two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi were seen in the 1920 'Cooperative Movement' and the 1942 'uit India' movement.
The face of the non-cooperation movement was similar, then in 42, the situation was such that the intensity of the movement grew so much that a great soul like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karenge Yamarenge'.
These achievements were peoples support, peoples participation, peoples resolve and peoples associations.
The entire country fought together that day.
I have sometimes seen the collection of the leaflets of history and it shows that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857.
Beginning in 1857, this war is taking place at every juncture of the country till 1942 and in this long period, it has given rise to a strong demand for freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Every man is committed to something or the other.
Generations have changed, but their determination has not come to an end.
A group of people have come, have joined the struggle, have gone, a new team has come, they have also fought the same way. And they have tried their best for the upliftment of the British Empire.
From 1857 to 1942, it brought the movement to such a stage that it reached its peak in 1942 and the Vishaan of Bharat kadu was so bad that it could reach English within five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, the handiwork of freedom came to every countrymen and from 1942 to 1942, five years of solemn pledge was due to the country's independence.
These five years were the main determinants.
Now I want to connect with you people in this process.
In 1947, we became independent and in 2017.
It's been almost 70 years.
The government's here.
The rules and regulations have been framed, changed, modified.
Everyone has worked on their own to get rid of the country's problems.
Efforts are being made to increase the income of the people of the country and to eradicate poverty and development.
And hope has increased.
On the 15th of August, 2017, we will observe Sankalp Parv and fulfil the resolution when we mark 75 years of independence in 2022.
5 years from 1942 to 54 years of independence, from 2017 to 2022, it will be a decisive year for Indias future.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
A resolution that we will achieve in the next five years.
Please come forward with the help of technology, with video posts, blogs, registers and new ideas.
This movement has to become a mass movement.
uit India uiz for Youth Friends will be organised in the Narendra Modi App.
The uiz competition is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the heroes of our glorious history and freedom struggle.
I am glad that in the last three years, I have received several suggestions from every corner of the country to discuss what should be said on 15th August, the main objective of these proposals is to realise their dreams as words.
On 15th August, I will try to discuss these proposals in whatever time I get.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about another topic today.
Socio-economic policy is very much linked to India's economy.
It should never be used to it.
Our festivals are not just for joy and happiness.
Our festivals, festivals and festivals, together with the drive for social reforms, are directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor of the country.
After a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Phase VI Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepavali etc. will come together and the poor will get some benefits from it.
This festival also enjoys a natural pleasure.
In terms of economy, a few months before the Rakshabandhan Festival, hundreds of households were engaged in small family businesses.
Various types of threads are used in cotton, silk etc. And nowadays people prefer to keep a homemade.
Hundreds and thousands of businessmen are associated with the festival of Rakhi, the people associated with the sales, the sweet traders.
Deepawali is directly related to those poor families who have made small soil lamps.
Today, when I talk about festivals and the economy of the poor people associated with it, at the same time I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of our country are more aware and active than me and I have realized that too.
Awareness citizens have written to me about the last one month's environment.
They have urged me to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi so that people like Ganesh, make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition, this year marks the 125th anniversary of the Ganesh Utsav.
125th year and 125 crore Indians.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was started keeping in mind the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reforms.
Come, let us also recall that during the Ganesh Festival this year, we have organised compositions, seminars etc.
Let us connect this festival with the economy of the poor, let the joy of our festival become the economic festival of the poor, let it become a financial festival of the poor and let it become a financing festival of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for the next several years.
My dear countrymen, be it education or be it economic sector or be it social sector or be it sports, our daughters are illuminating the country and making new achievements.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters and we are honoured for them.
Just a few days ago, our mates showed excellent skills in women cricket.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet all these players.
They had these impressions on their faces.
I told them that I had a different value for them.
I have seen this thing that if Indian sportspersons are unconscious then the anger of the countrymen falls on the players.
Some people say something that breaks the dignity, inscribes things that are painful.
Not all this, the girl praised her, honoured her.
I have seen a wonderful change in this thing and I have asked these girls to see that you have got this opportunity only for yourselves.
Whether you win a match or not, you have won the hearts of 25 billion people.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to illuminate the country's name.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August movement and once again I would like to remind you of the 9th August.
Let every citizen of India pledge, let every citizen of India guide us in five years to fulfil his pledges.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with this belief that the future of the country will be better.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Climate change is changing.
It was hot this time.
But fortunately, the rainy season is following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, it feels comfortable in the cold winds of the past day.
We all have seen how much anxiety or anxiety is there in personal life or in public life, the advent of rain changes our mental condition.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is going on in different parts of the country with great enthusiasm and joy.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in some parts of the world.
The poor people of the country are specially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English which means a beautiful chariot that cannot be stopped.
This word has come from Jagannathadeva.
This shows that the people of the world have accepted the importance of this journey of Jagannath Dev in their own way.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us all collectively take inspiration from this holy festival and take the country forward by eliminating a treasure of happiness.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I learnt about a very inspiring incident in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
5,500 Muslim brothers and sisters live in this small village, mostly Muslim families.
In this Ramzan month, everyone in the village decided to build toilets.
17 lakh has been given to them as Government assistance for construction of private toilets.
You will be happy to hear that in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of Ramzan have given back 17 lakhs of rupees to the government and they have said that our toilets will be built in our hard work and in our money.
17 lakh per gram for other services.
I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this auspicious occasion of Ramzan for bringing about this change in social development.
Their every aspect is very inspiring.
Above all, they have made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free (ODF).
We are aware that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I am particularly grateful to the administration and the people of this state for completing this work.
We are well aware of the fact that there is a lot of hard work to do individual life or in social life.
If my handwriting is bad, it's time for a long time to work on it consciously.
This is how it changes physical and mental conditions.
Cleanliness is the same thing.
Some bad habits have become our habit.
Everyone's gotta be attracted.
Repeated memories of inspiring events.
I am glad that cleanliness is no longer just government programs.
It is taking the form of a mass movement in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this initiative forward with the participation of the people then it naturally increases the strength.
I remember a good thing that I would like to tell you.
The incident took place in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their aim was to build 71 Gram Panchayats 15,000 household toilets in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and local administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free (ODF).
in. All these suggestions come in the All India Radio through letters.
It is important to be conscious of democracy and hence it is important to remember the events that affect democracy and promote goodwill for democracy.
On 25th June, 1957, a black day that a democracy lover cannot forget.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voices of the opposition were hailed.
Respected leaders of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were imprisoned.
The justice system has not been relieved of the grave emergency.
The newspaper was completely unnecessary.
Students and democrats from todays press are also reminded of the dark day and are constantly striving to raise awareness about democracy.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed.
Atal ji wrote a poem on the occasion of Emergency Year, describing the mental condition of that poem.
We have to strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world became Yoga.
People from sea to mountains welcomed the rays of the sun through Yoga every morning.
Is there any Indian who can't be proud of it
Its not like that Yoga used to be practiced earlier but today when Yoga has been linked to Yoga then Yoga has become the reason behind the world's unity.
Almost all the countries of the world have opted for this Yoga.
On the one hand, the Great Wall of China has practiced people in China, while on the other hand, the World Heritage Site of Peru at a height of 2,400 meters above sea level has practiced Yoga at Machuphi.
In France, the Eiffel Tower was shadowed by the man.
More than four thousand people have collaborated in Abu Dhabi of UAE.
In Herat of Afghanistan, India-Afghan Friendship Dam has given India a new horizon of friendship by joining hands with Salma Bandhan.
Seventy places have been organized in Singapore and they have carried out a campaign throughout the week.
Ten Postage Stamps have been released on the occasion of United Nations International Yoga Day.
Yoga Partnerships have been conducted in the United Nations Headquarters.
Employees of the United Nations and the entire world are participating in it.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, about 50,000 people of Gujarat have joined hands and created a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in Yoga celebrations in Lucknow.
But for the first time, I was fortunate to join the rain.
Our soldiers are practicing Yoga in Siachen, where Minus is 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Be it our Armed Forces, B-SF, IT-BP, CR-P-FO, CI-S-F, everyone has participated in Yoga along with their duties.
On Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family should join hands and share their photographs.
Some TV channels have taken this thing forward.
I got a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them have been compiled and placed on the Narendra Modi App.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit a very dear institution.
For a few days, a good event has been organised in Kerala, the foundation of P Enpanicker Foundation has created a habit of reading among people, encouraging people to read books, so reading day, reading maantha is being celebrated.
I had the opportunity to attend it, and there I was also told that we would give a book, not a flower rod.
My goodness.
And now I remember the same thing that went away from my concentration.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had formulated a system in the government that we will not break it, we will give it or we will welcome it with a handkerchief.
He will be the Fleece so that Khadi's Srivadhighat.
As long as I was in Gujarat, it became the habit of everyone, but after coming here, my habit went away.
But that habit awakened in Kerala again.
And I'm starting to issue a notice to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
The flower's yields are very low.
I have to take it from my hand once.
But if I give you a book, it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a family member.
When I went to London, ueen Elizabeth, the ueen of Britain, invited me to dinner.
It's been years since ueen Elizabeth took care of Mahatma Gandhi's handkerchief.
And she showed me very happy to go.
When I was watching, I didn't know if he wanted me to touch him.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life, a part of his history.
I believe that these habits don't change at night and sometimes it's a criticism.
But despite this, such things should be highlighted, efforts should be made.
Now I can't say I went somewhere and somebody stretched a flower, so I won't tell him, I can't do it.
Anyway, there will be discussions, but we should keep talking and it will change gradually.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work has been done in the field of becoming the Prime Minister.
I had to be immersed in the files, but I had developed a habit of myself and I read some letters in the letters that I received and thereby provided an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various kinds of people write letters.
In this case, I feel like letting you know.
A housewife from the far south of Tamil Nadu, Arulmozhi wrote a letter.
Whatever he was writing in that letter, I was thinking of taking care of my world, taking care of children's studies so that there was a lot of money in the world.
Similarly, in the Mudra Yojana, I started the process of borrowing something from the bank and buying it from the market.
I have heard that the government has started a system called Governance e-Marketplace.
So I took the search and registered myself in that system.
Anyone who wants to supply any commodity to the government, may have an electric bulb, may want to supply dustbins, may be brooms, chairs, may be tables.
He wrote, First of all, I got the money from the Mudra Yojana and started my business, then I registered all the goods sold in E-GEM and then I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
I wanted to know what the PMO wanted to buy.
He said he bought the bread thermos and got a paint of 1600.
Yeah, that's the Empowerment.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace- GEM.
I would like that the number of those who want to sell something to the government continues to grow.
I understand that this is a unique example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and aims at MinimumPrice and Maximease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we can take pride in Yoga, on the other hand we can also take pride in the achievements of Space Science.
This is India's specialty that Yoga has spread to the soil of our country and it is also our country's distant space mission.
India has made great strides in sports and science before this.
Today, India is bringing new heights of success not only in the land but also in the space.
ISRO has launched 30 nanosatellites along with Cartosat-2 satellites just a few days ago.
These satellites include France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
These nano satellites of India will provide immense beneficial information on the farming sector forecasting of natural resources for the benefit of farmers.
A few days ago, we must remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Just imagine how our philosophers have achieved great stature in space exploration.
19th June marks a thousand days of the Mars Mission.
You all remember that we had successfully set up the Mars Mission in Forbit and its term was fixed for six months.
It was six months in office.
But what an extraordinary skill of our scientists is that even after six months it has passed a thousand days.
Our scientific journey to commemorate thousands of years has been a landmark achievement in our space research.
Our younger generation is brightening their skills and their physical capabilities in the field of sports as well as in studies.
Indias badminton sportsperson Kidambi Championships in Indonesia and Spain have brought laurels to the country.
I congratulate the retired Srikanth and his coach.
T.
Sports plays an important role in personal development.
Sports contributes significantly to the development of overall personality.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If the family's kids are bent on sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, my countrymen, the joyous festivals of rainy season and festivals give a special mention of this time.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
In the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the people of the world, especially to the Muslim community in this holy month.
During Ramzan, special emphasis was laid on prayer, spirituality and mercy.
We Indians are extremely fortunate. Our forefathers have created a tradition that Indians can take pride.
25 billion Indians take pride in this thing that India is home to all the communities of the world.
This is a country that believes in God or atheists who have worshipped idols or those who are opposed to idol worshippers, all kinds of thoughts, all kinds of worshipping practices, all the traditions, all the traditions have worked hard to live together.
Whether it is religion, community, thought or tradition, it gives us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will help in furthering this trend of peace, unity and good thinking.
I once again convey my best wishes.
Last time when I had said Mann Ki Baat, I used a word especially to the youngsters to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone with a new feeling.
And this is the age to live like this - to risk a little bit, to face hardship.
I'm glad that many people gave me feedback.
Everyone has encouraged me to speak personally.
There are so many messages that I can't read them all, I can't even listen to the messages sent by everyone.
But I have seen everything that has come in my eyes, some are trying to learn songs, some are showing hands with new musical instruments, some are trying to teach new things using YouTube, some are trying to learn new languages, some are learning new languages, some are learning dances, some are learning drama, some are writing poems.
I almost stopped studying.
That's why I tried to read this vacation.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle then I realized how many struggles and sacrifices were made for India's freedom, how many years were spent in jail for the freedom struggle.
I have been inspired by the life of Bhagat Singh who did a lot of things at a very young age.
That's why I urge you to say something about this in today's era.
I am glad that todays youth is expressing their willingness to know about our history, our freedom fighters and those who have sacrificed their lives for our country.
Several years ago, I went to Andaman and Nicobar.
I went to see the cellular jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar sat in jail and wrote a book Manji Janmath.
He wrote poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked up in a small room.
How hard we had to bear for freedom
When I read the book 'Manji Janmath' of Savarkar ji, I get the inspiration to see the cellular jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no state in India, no language speaking person who did not pay tribute to Kalapani for freedom, and in the jails of Andaman and Cellular jails he was deserving his life.
If you ever get the opportunity to visit the pilgrimage centre of our freedom struggle then you must also visit the pilgrimage centre of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of June.
And this year the theme of the United Nations is Connecting People to Nature.
In other words, back to basics.
And who says that better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi has said several times: One must care about a world one will not see, that is, it is our duty to think and think about the world that we have not seen.
When he got tired, he opened the windows and breathed fresh air.
The Panchbhavas that formed our body, when connected with the Panchbhavas then it is you who instill a new life and a new energy in our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it, we couldn't bind it in a single rope.
Thereafter, you must see that whenever you are associated with different natural conditions, you will have a new consciousness within you.
And that is why on 5th June, we have to undertake a global campaign to associate ourselves with nature.
Our ancestors have been doing some work to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get his results.
Veda, the world and the environment are considered to be the root of energy.
We say Motherland: Son Ahm Earthback:
The Veda said that the sanctity that we have in our midst is for our world.
Earth is our mother and we are her children.
If we think of Lord Buddha then one thing must come out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana - all three had happened in the tree.
But we need to connect them with modern words and modern debates.
This time I got news from different states.
With the advent of rains, a massive plantation drive has started in almost all the states.
Millions of trees are planted.
As World Yoga Day, the entire world celebrates this day.
Within a short span of time, this World Yoga Day has spread all over the country and is involving people.
On the one hand, many powers that discriminate on the planet are showing their shape and at this time, World Yoga Day is a major contribution of India.
Through Yoga, we have binded the entire world together.
The way Yoga binds body, mind, intellect and soul together, Yoga binds the world together.
Yoga has played a crucial role in achieving a stress-free life in this unprecedented medication and day-to-day life.
Yoga is not just an exercise , it is healthy that is fitted with body , mind , judgement , and it is possible to experience this harmony through yoga exercise only .
Two days ago, on Yoga Day, I wrote letters to all the governments and leaders of all the countries of the world.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and some awards were announced.
A funny proposal.
This is the third International Yoga Day, I would like to urge that three generations of the same family perform yoga together on this third International Yoga Day.
Be it grandparents or grandparents or grandparents, parents, boys or daughters, all three generations of yoga should do yoga and upload the photos.
A lucky combination of yesterday, today and tomorrow will give a new direction to Yoga.
I express my gratitude to all of you for this proposal. And I believe that the way we have carried out the campaign of selfie with Daughter and have made a pleasant feeling, the images of these three generations of Yoga will create vibrations in the entire country and the world.
You must send me a picture through the Narendra Modi App, where three generations of people are doing Yoga together.
It'll be tomorrow, today and tomorrow, a beautiful guarantee.
I invite all of you.
There are still three weeks left for International Yoga Day.
Start a habit from today.
You should also campaign for three weeks of uninterrupted Yoga, spread it, involve people.
This is a kind of preventive health care movement.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
The day since you assumed charge of me as the Chief Servant, and from the Red Fort I had got the opportunity to speak on 15th August, I had told you about cleanliness that day.
From that day onwards, I have visited different parts of India.
Today, on Modi ji, on TV and on social media, I have seen that wherever you are going, the people of that place are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, at your instance, people have adopted Swachhata as a mission.
Even the elders were conscious of cleanliness.
Many times the smaller ones turned their backs on seeing the bigger ones drowned.
The cleanliness that you have started from the Kashi Ghat has taken the face of a movement inspired by you.
You are right, wherever I go, there is government sanitation work, but today there is a festival of cleanliness in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
Preparations will be made to welcome the Prime Minister, but cleanliness will be the first.
It will automatically enjoy any transparent guy.
I would like to thank everyone for insisting on this cleanliness.
Someone gave me an offer.
Well, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji , whenever you are going to invite me , then tell me , if you invite me to what level of cleanliness will be , what kind of waste will you give me , on the basis of which I will fix my departure .
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Again, there is a need for a movement, and instead of other things, we will clean up a few tons of waste.
How many people we will save from sickness.
What a great humanitarian task.
Once wealth is considered, new methods of waste management will come up.
The youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with a new plan and a new apparatus.
It is expected that these four thousand cities will be dried up in blue dustbin and wet waste in green dustbin.
Kitchen waste, vegetable skins, furniture, eggs, tree leaves, all these are wet waste- green dustbins.
If you keep in mind the greenness of the food grains then you will remember what to do in the green dustbin.
And the remaining wastes like unnecessary papers, iron, card boards, glasses, clothing, plastics, polythene, rubber and other metals are not used in machines, they are usually not used in blue dustbins.
I believe that we can develop a habit like this and we need to take new steps for cleanliness so that we can fulfil the dreams of Gandhijis dream of cleanliness.
Today, I would like to proudly mention what kind of mass movement a person can create if he thinks.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
In the last few days, you must have heard the stinking Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean, clean Barsova beach.
It wasn't sudden that a citizen worked hard for 80-90 weeks and replaced the image of Barsoba Beach with thousands of tons of dirt and made Barsova Beach clean, beautiful.
And Versova Residential Volunteer has been responsible for it.
Shri Afroz Shah, an individual from October, 2015, became supremely active and gradually more people joined this movement and took the form of a mass movement.
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) awarded Afroz Shah for this work.
He is the first Indian to be conferred the Championsof the Earth Award.
I came to know that the local women have taken the lead in this task.
In order to create awareness among the people, they have motivated everyone by visiting every household in every street and every household.
I also extend my heartiest congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I also congratulate the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for making an open defecation free movement.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days, continuous discussions are going on in newspapers, TV channels and on social media over the last three years of the present government.
Three years ago, you took over as the Chief Servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I also thank all those people who have given critical and important feedback, who have been misleading the work, have got the opportunity to make it easier.
For a conscious nation, this criticism is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, as a common citizen like me and you, I have the same impact in the minds of an ordinary citizen.
There are hundreds of families who wrote this to me.
As an ordinary man, as an ordinary citizen, it has a special effect on my mind, which has inspired me.
I'm grateful to Mr. Akbar.
Come, let us all walk in love with nature in this environment.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And the curiosity of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation to do something and the emotions of the elders come to our fore.
Every time all the inputs for Mann Ki Baat are analysed by the government.
What kind of advice, what complaints are, what kind of feelings people feel.
Overall, people's temperament is to give advice to others.
If anybody wants to go to the bus, please do the same with others.
But when I tried to see these things carefully, I was satisfied.
Most of the people have sent suggestions, have tried to reach out to me, those who have really done something in their lives.
They have tried to do some good work according to their intellect, energy, capabilities and opportunities.
And when I realized that, I realized that these suggestions weren't simple.
All this has come from the feelings of the Nigerians.
Some people think that if people listen to those things then they will get a bigger shape and it will benefit many people.
Not only this, whenever I mention something, I remind you of these things and am very happy.
I have never imagined that the youth of our country has been working on this thing for a long time.
Over the years, I knew that some social organisations have been working on this thing but I came to know that the youngsters of my country have also been working on this thing.
Many have sent me a video.
There's a lot of places where the bread bank runs.
People collect bread from the roti bank themselves, collect the bread from the bank, collect the bread from the bank and collect it for themselves.
Those who are giving, they like them, and those who are doing it dont think they are small.
This is an example of how the society works through cooperation.
Today is the last day of April.
On 1st May, Gujarat and Maharashtra were recognised as Angry States.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States have worked towards achieving new goals of development and development of the country.
And the coming of the great men in both the states and their lifestyle in every field of society continues to inspire us.
Remembering the great men on the start of the two states, let us resolve to scale new heights of development in our country, in our society, in our city and in our family by 2022, 75 years after the independence.
We need to plan to transform this resolution and enhance cooperation among all citizens.
The kind of warmth that was there in our country, it was the time for us to experience in March-April.
In Mann Ki Baat, when I was asking people to do more in this summer, I had suggested what should be done and people gave it.
Nothing is new, but it is useful to reflect on special occasions.
And I have seen that the kids of the family are doing this very well.
Once they realize why this water should be filled, you can see if there is water in the stars ten times a day.
And see if the birds are here.
I believe that there is a sporting activity but it is really a strange way to create compassion for the boys.
In our country, we live together in the form of animals and birds, we colour them, yet we need to work hard to preserve them.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, one hundred years of the cleric of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Mr.
He lived for 103 years.
And to commemorate his 100 years, the Bohra community launched a massive campaign to save the slopes through Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to launch this campaign.
About twelve thousand bird feeder spread them across the world.
This expedition has taken place at the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I have become so busy that I forget to give some water to those who come to my house with newspapers, milkmen, vegetables and postmen.
Young friends, I want to talk to you.
Sometimes I feel that some of our youngsters are enjoying living their lives in the comfort zone.
Their parents have brought up in their one-horetop.
Some people go through extreme opposites, but most people spend their lives in comfortzone.
Now the test is over, there are plans to make fun of the vacation.
It enjoys warming up in the summer.
But as a friend, I want to talk about how to spend your holidays.
I believe some people will surely change my words and let me know.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching things on TV, reading books, listening to them and feeling themselves.
Examining may be positive, a little exit from the comfortzone.
We are a middle-class family, a happy family.
Friends, Have you ever thought that without reservation of seats, I used to sit in a second class room in a train and travel 24 hours.
Sometimes you feel it, I'm not telling you to take it out, but do it once or twice.
In the evening, take your football, carry volleyball or other sports equipment to a poor slum.
Play with those poor boys and you will see that you have never enjoyed this game in your life before.
Whenever there will be an opportunity for such children living in the society to meet you, do you think that how big changes will be brought about in the lives of those children
This experience will tell you a lot.
Several NGOs have been working on this service.
Sometimes a lot of memorials are organised for personality development. It can help in the development of various kinds of developments.
If you are engaging in the Summer Camp, you are doing a personality development course, you go freely to all those people of the society who have been deprived of this course and teach them what you have learnt.
How to do all this work, you can teach.
Our concern is that the technology that has come to reduce the distance between the two, but the result is that there are six convergences in the same room, but the gap between them has increased so much that is not imagined.
Everyone is getting busy with new technology somewhere else.
Staying together is also a reform, that is energy.
Second, I want to tell you about the skills you don't want to learn something new.
I try to get good results, I lose myself, I get admitted to some coaching class in Vacation, I get anxiety for further examination.
Sometimes I'm scared, our younger generation isn't going to be robots.
Skill development can be a bit more emphasised.
Some people are learning musical instruments, some are learning five-fifty words from Tamil, Telugu, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, maybe it won't be a good picture, but you can try to draw something on the paper.
You want to learn how to drive, ever learn how to drive auto-rickshaws
You see, these new experiments, their skills will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the stupid verses that have tied your life.
Get out of conventional life, do something, guys.
It's an opportunity to make life.
You might think that all the exams will be over, that's when we go to the new career.
Again, you're going to get involved in some other problem, so I'll tell you, if you have the hobby of learning your magic, then at least learn the magic.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something you don't know, you'll be very beneficial.
Your inner human qualities will be awakened and there will be many ways of progress.
I'm telling myself that we can't even imagine what we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
But before going, wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I see things like gods, understandings, discussions among people, asking, all these things can be done, but the pleasure of seeing those new places increases.
Stay in the same place for three to four days.
Go to other places and stay for three days and four days.
You can learn a lot more than that.
Where did you go
You share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the government of India has given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They're starting to believe in digital currency.
But if you refer to someone else or take care of someone else and that new person deals with money thrice, you earn ten rupees.
Ten rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you pay 20 people a day, you'll earn 200 rupees by evening.
Businessmen can also get income, students can get income.
This scheme is till 14th October. This will be your default in creating a Digital India.
Now the red lights are gone, so no one can say that the red lights in the mind are gone.
I got an interesting phone call.
The phone also expresses apprehensions but it shows that people did not like it at all, they used to feel a distance.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Choubey.
I'd like to say something about the government's Red Bacon Light Ban.
I don't have to get trapped in traffic jams, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I would like to thank you very much for this principle.
Thank you for the fact that your grandfather is getting cleaner.
Red lighting is a part of the government system.
But from our minds we have to try to get rid of this feeling.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that our history, our culture and our heritage must be remembered.
We can save energy and get inspiration from this.
This year we are celebrating the millennium of Saint Ramanujacharya.
Centenary celebrations in other countries of the world are sufficient but India is so ancient that we have the opportunity to remind ourselves of thousands of years or more.
Thousands of years ago, he had worked and succeeded with the entrance to the temple.
We are so fortunate that some or the other great men were born in this country to deny the faults of the society.
On the occasion of the 100th birth anniversary of Santa Ramuzhacharya, we can draw inspiration from him to showcase the power of collective efforts towards social unity.
The Government of India is releasing a Postage Stamp in memory of the saint on 1st May, 2019.
I pay my respects and salute to Sant Ramanujacharya.
Dear countrymen, tomorrow is another significance of 1st May.
This day is celebrated as Labour Day in some parts of the world.
And when it comes to labour day, when it comes to labour and labour, I will remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people know that today we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the facilities and honors provided by the workers.
Babasahebs role in the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramanujacharya, I also remember the great saint and socialist Jagatguru Vasaveshwara of Karnataka in the 12th century.
In the twelfth century, he had a detailed discussion on labour and labour in Kannada.
He had spoken in Kannada - Kay Kove Kailas.
This means that through hard work you will be able to reach the Alai Kailas of Shiva.
Today, when I talk of labour, it is very natural to remember Pt. Tengadi.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
All the Buddhists from across the globe celebrate that day.
And in India, the journey from the war to the Buddha is a unique example in the life of Mahatma Ashok.
It is applicable especially to our neighbours.
Let our neighbours co-operate and develop.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India to launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May 2019
The benefits of this satellite will be immensely beneficial in the economic and other developmental areas of South Asian countries.
These include mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education, IT connectivity and people-to-people contacts and South Asia Satellites which will help our entire region grow.
A valuable gift from India is a reflection of our commitment to South Asia.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the South Asian Satellite countries in South Asia.
Mann Ki Baat, March, 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy testing their children.
Those who have been tested have a bit of relaxation and the families are still under pressure where the exams are being conducted.
But at one point of time I would like to repeat the words that I had told the students of Mann Ki Baat last time.
Those words will certainly be useful for you during the test.
March 26, 2019.
26th March, Bangladesh Independence Day.
Historical fight against injustice and the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today on this auspicious day, I convey my best wishes to the people of Bangladesh for their freedom.
I would like to assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We are all proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are the heritage of both our countries.
The national music of Bangladesh is also written by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting fact about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person in Asia to receive the award but also the British gave him the title of Nighthood .
And when the British slaughtered the Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who fought against it and at that time a child of twelve years had a profound impact on it.
The brutal assassination of the Jallianwala Bagh brought a new face in the life of the boy who smiled in the fields.
And in 1919, the 12 year old Bhagwat Bhagwat ji was the inspiration of all of us.
Three days back today, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru. And we all know that on 23rd March, the same incident - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had the satisfaction of serving Mother India. There was no fear of death.
They sacrificed all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
And those three heroes still inspire us.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three youths.
Prisoners were imprisoned, it was decided on the day of the hanging, but the British were worried about what to do with them.
So on March 24, where the hanging was held there, the 23rd.
Hiding is what we don't normally see.
And then the British quietly burnt their bodies in Punjab today.
Several years ago when I got the opportunity to visit that place then I felt the vibration of that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to visit Punjab, you must visit the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, the mother of Bhagat Singh and Vatukeshwar Dattatreya.
This is the time when the handful of freedom, his intensity, his madness grew.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the armed revolution of the youth.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi had Satyagraha at Champaran on April 10, 1917, exactly 100 years ago.
This year marks the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the Gandhian ethos and the Gandhian style of Indias freedom struggle were reflected.
In the entire freedom movement, this was a pattern of change, especially from the perspective of the traditions of the Sangh.
This festival, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the Hartal of the factory workers in Ahmedabad and all these had a profound impact on the work culture and attitude of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1915, Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the picture of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a man who came back to Hindustan in 1915 for just two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such a place where Mahatma Gandhi's organisational trick, the power of constellation of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the power of constellation of Nakshatras, the power of consciousness, the power of consciousness, the power of consciousness against the British rule, the power of the poor and the altogether illiterate, the power of inspiring and bringing them to the battlefield was demonstrated.
Therefore, we can feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, the Gandhian Satyagraha of Champaran, then the Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of deep study for any person who has recently entered the public life.
We can learn from him how much hard work we have to do and how Gandhi did it.
And there was a time when the great leaders, whose names we heard were Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Hon. Gandhi had sent everyone to the village.
Prisoning on the one hand is to put yourself on a constructive task.
There was a strange bond between Gandhi's style.
What could be the meaning of Satyagraha, what could be uncomfortable, what could be the meaning of non-cooperation in front of such a large empire - not only with words but also with a successful presentation, Gandhiji had presented a new vision.
This mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', focusing on 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' and making efforts to do something for the country and for the society, will fulfil the dreams of those great men who laid down their lives for the country's freedom.
And in the 21st century there is such an Indian who does not want to change, who does not want to become a partner in the progress of the country.
25 billion Indians will be producing the seeds of a New India.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
Our idea of serving our nation, Ratnagarbha and Jansebai Prabhu was born to us.
If we look at this thinking in a collective manner then we can understand how powerful it is.
It is very natural and compulsory that a different viewpoint will emerge when we talk about India.
But it is also true that the dream of a New India can be fulfilled if the people of the country make a solemn pledge and take steps to realise it.
It is not necessary that the work should be done in the budget or the government expenditure.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge to follow the traffic rules, follows the rules of self-determination, stops the use of petrol and diesel at least one day in a week, then through this small step we will take a new dimension.
I would like to say that everybody should follow his own citizenship and perform his duties.
This is the way New India can be launched.
India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
I urge you to come, make your lives diligent and solemn and participate in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you all.
The BHIM App was launched two-and-a-half months ago but almost 1. 5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take the fight against black money and corruption forward.
You cannot imagine that you can become a big partner in the country, you can make yourself a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, DigiDhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
Approximately 12. 5 lakh people have been awarded specific awards and seventy thousand people have been awarded specific awards for business.
Let us join this endeavour to reduce cash transactions and use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I want your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat, I get a lot of suggestions.
But I have noticed that there is no dearth of interest in cleanliness.
I guess how important cleanliness is to explain to the common man.
I pass by a river every day, where people pollut the river by throwing a lot of garbage.
This river comes from the Rispana bridge and flows beyond our house.
In order to keep this river clean, I went to Paraya and talked to the people, I had met them but there was no special benefit.
I would urge you to send a team here or publish it through the press.
Brothers and sisters, You see how hard a girl is suffering from the eleventh century.
He's so angry to see the dirty waste in the river.
I think this is a good signal.
I want that there is anger against garbage in the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, an outrage, we will be able to make sure we do something about the drive against garbage.
It is a good thing that Gayathri himself expressed his anger, advised me and at the same time told me that he tried a lot, but failed.
Since the movement of Swachhata has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is associated with it in a positive way.
It took the form of a movement.
Hate for garbage is slowly growing.
Be it awareness or be it active participation or be it movement, it has its own importance.
This movement is possible in a holistic manner.
It's hard to work, but we have to do it.
I believe that the consciousness among the youth of the country, among the boys, among the students and among the youth of the country is indicative of a positive outcome.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell all the people who are listening to Gayatri that the speeches of Gayatri should be addressed by us.
I don't want half of the plates in my belly, and I just throw it out there.
Sometimes you have seen how much we waste our food that we leave.
Have you ever imagined that if you don't go waste, how much this food fills the stomach of a poor man
There's nothing different about this.
Normally when the mother serves food to the small children in our house then she asks them to take as much as you can eat .
There are some attempts at this epidemic, but in spite of this, apathy is reflected in social disorder.
It's unfair to the poor.
Secondly, if the savings are saved then the family will also get financial benefits.
For the society thoughts are good but this thing is such that the family will also get benefitted by this .
I don't want to say anything about it but I want to raise awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with this kind of movement.
This kind of hard work is being done by the youngsters of our country.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we do not waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate empty , keep the stomach a little empty .
When we talk of health then we say ' World Health Day ' on April 7 .
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.
This time, the United Nations has focused on depression on April 7, 2019, on World Health Day.
According to one report, more than 35 crore people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many around us are the victims of this disease, but we don't understand it, and perhaps we feel hesitant to talk openly about it.
I would like to tell my countrymen that depression is not like that one cannot get rid of it.
Building a psychologist complex, he begins to get rid of it.
First thing is that we need to express our expression without suppressing the expression.
Along with your friends, tell your parents, brothers and sisters, what is happening in you
Have you ever wondered why that man was doing this
You must be sure that this is the first sign of depression.
If anybody wants to keep himself away from the middle of everyone and stay alone then take care of him not to be alone.
Let those whom he likes to live with.
Encourage him to speak frankly in a funny manner, find out what is hidden in his mind.
In diseases like diabetes, where people become physically weak, depression reduces the consciousness of people, takes courage, reduces the strength of fighting in life and destroys all our lives.
Your self-confidence will come back if you start resolving other problems with the minds of service.
If you can match yourself with others, you can serve yourself and if you can do it selflessly, see if your mind turns lighter.
Yoga practices are the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is a very effective way to get rid of psychological disorders, to get rid of diarrhoea and to enjoy happiness.
International Day of Yoga was celebrated every year on 21st June.
If you are going to give some suggestions on the occasion of International Yoga Day, send me all the ideas through my mobile app and guide me.
Keep writing all the poems and songs related to yoga so that an inspiration comes to the common man .
This time I will talk to my mothers and sisters about healthcare.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The maternity leave given during pregnancy to working women during childbirth and post-natal childbirth was 12 weeks earlier.
Only two or three countries are ahead of us in this regard.
When these children grow up, the country will be rich.
New Year festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
The New Year is celebrated in Maharashtra on the occasion of 'Gudhi Padhava', 'Ugadi', 'Sindhi 'Cheti Chand', 'Kashmiri Navreh', 'Samvatsar Puja' at Ayodhya, 'Judh Sheetal' in Mithila, Bihar and 'Satuvani' in Magadh.
India is full of diversity.
New Year greetings to all of you
Thank you so much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The bird's brightness brings the heart of pleasure.
Not only flowers, but fruits also grow in the branches of the trees.
Summer fruits also show a crown of mangoes.
In the same way, the cultivator of the chest is expected to see yellow mustard cultivation in the field.
The red flower from Palash indicates Holly's arrival.
Amir Khasru has given a very beautiful description of this period of seasonal change.
He writes: Flooding mustard is grown in the forest, plass is boiling, Kuhu-Kuh.
When the colour of nature touches joy in nature, when it touches joy in nature, people also enjoy it.
Vasant-Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint the lives of people.
And that's why he said I should say 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Shobhaji thank you very much for recalling Indias pride.
Technology and science have proved their role in fighting poverty, protecting oneself from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge and information.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day in the national life of India.
Our scientists have raised our heads above the world.
And we are aware that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented projects in a few years.
After the success of Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars, ISRO has recently established a world record for space missions.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also heartening to note that this is the 38th Sustainable PSLV launch.
This is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISROs Affordable Affordable Space Programme has been a marvel for the entire world and hence the world is appreciating the achievements of Indias scientists in the open mind.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters will be able to know how much water is available in our country, how to use it and what to focus on it. Our new satellite cartosat-2D will be of great help.
He sent some pictures when we reached the satellite room.
He's starting his work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our young scientists, our women scientists have led this campaign.
This remarkable collaboration of youth and women is a privilege for ISROs success.
On behalf of the countrymen, I appreciate the scientists of ISRO.
They have always kept the aim of using epics for the benefit of the common man, for the service of the nation and are creating new heights every day.
The more we appreciate our scientists and their entire team, the less it will be.
Shobhaji asked another question and it is related to India's security.
India has successfully tested ballisticinterceptor missiles in defence sector.
The interception technologically qualified missile has successfully snatched a 100-kilometer surgeon missile from the soil during its pilot flight.
This is a major achievement in the defence sector.
When I see new technologies and new scientific achievements then it gives us happiness.
And asking has played an important role in the development of human life.
And the intellectual who does not allow asking questions to be placed in the form of questions, he puts questions in his mind, he creates new inquiries, he adds.
Asked for new inventions.
They don't calm down until they get answers.
And if we look at the course of thousands of years of human evolution, we can say that there is no deterrence in this development of human life.
Full taboo is impossible.
The universe, the laws of creation, the minds of mankind are constantly on the move.
New science, new technologies emerge from it.
And every technology, every form of science, every generation gives birth to a new generation.
My dear youngsters, when we talk of science, the hard work of scientists, I remember that once I had said this Mann Ki Baat programme that the younger generation should be attracted towards science.
Several scientists are required in the country.
Todays scientific community will transform the lives of the future generations.
When science researches, innovations and innovations take place for the benefit of the common man, science becomes an integral part of mankind.
This is where I have seen an innovation for our poor fishermen.
All such innovations were obtained from this competition.
Various services and technologies are getting faster.
Technology, however, has become an integral part of life.
Indias digital transition rate is rising.
In particular, the youngsters are removing their mobile and digital payments.
I think it's a good sign.
There is a huge gain in the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'DG Dhan Vyapar Yojana'.
About two months ago, 15,000 people are receiving prizes of Rs. 1000 per day from these two schemes.
One lakh rupees have been awarded to the beneficiaries.
Fifty thousand rupees have been paid to more than four thousand traders.
Mysuru Smt. Santosh expressed happiness at the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1000 for the Loki Grahak Yojana.
Then I think Mr. Santosh should share with you what he wrote.
I am so delighted to know that Santosh ji, both your name and your work have given us immense happiness.
On the one hand, he is driving a car and on the other hand he has become the ambassador of the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
Vehicles are also encouraging them to be aware of digital systems and many more have started participating in the digital system with the same spirit.
A young friend from Maharashtra, Pooja Nemad, interacted with his friends on how the use of Rupa cards, e-wallets are being used in a postgraduate family and how happy they are.
One lakh prizes are important for him and he is also encouraging others to take it on a mission mode.
In a way, the fight against corruption and black money plays a crucial role.
A memorable day.
A few days ago, Babasaheb Ambedkar passed away on his 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering him, you should also teach at least 125 people to download BHIM.
Teach how to deal with it.
Therefore, I would like to say that the foundation stone laid by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar has to be strengthened.
BHIM App has to be delivered to 125 crore people by visiting the households.
The success of this movement that has been going on for the past three months has been achieved in many villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today, I want to tell you something of a joy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill the stores of food grains.
The hard work of the farmers of our country has resulted in the maximum production of paddy this year.
All the information indicates that our farmers have broken all the old records.
The way the crops have grown in the fields this year, every day we celebrate Pongal or Baisakhi festivals.
This year, more than 7 crore tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
Eight percent more than the last record of our farmers.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I would particularly like to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of the country have listened to the poor and about two hundred and twenty lakh hectares have cultivated variety of pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service to the poor by the farmers of the country.
I am extremely grateful to my farmer brothers and sisters for their hard work and record production of pulses by requesting me a request.
My dear countrymen, in our country some or the other programmes are being organized for cleanliness by the government, by the society, by institutions and by organizations.
In some ways, everybody is aware of cleanliness.
The seminar was organized at Warangal, Telangana, wherein the importance of direct cleanliness was highlighted.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Six toilet pits have been cleaned and the officers themselves showcased how to evacuate the TwinPit Toilets.
They also showed how comfortable the toilets of this new system are, and there are no other difficulties or complications, from evacuation to cleaning.
We also do small cleaning work, just like we can clean toilet holes.
A Standard Twin Pittoilet has been filled in about 5-6 years for a family of six members.
Our farmers are very well familiar with NPK.
Different government departments and sanitation aspects are followed in different ways.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will also participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the second side of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will undertake Swachhata Abhiyan.
We are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something remarkable then the entire country gets a new strength and a new confidence increases.
Welcome to the way our Divyang athletes have done in the Rio Paralympics.
India has made Pakistan proud for the second time by defeating Pakistan at the Blind T20 World Cup final held this month.
I once again congratulate all the players in this team.
The country is proud of the success of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that the Divyang brothers and sisters are supportive, courageous, courageous and unbreakable in their resolve.
We can always learn something new from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, our daughters are not lagging behind.
They have moved on foot and have made the country proud of their achievements.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won silver medals at the Asian Ragubevens Trophy.
I congratulate all these sportspersons.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
This is not just a government scheme, it has now become a campaign of social consciousness and people's education.
In the last two years, people have also been associated with this scheme.
All the burning sensations from every corner of the country have also made the common man think and for years to come people have been changing their attitude towards old traditions.
It is indeed heartening to note that the festival of birth of a daughter has commemorated.
Such positive attitude towards a daughter leads to social recognition.
I came to know that the district of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu has been able to stop child marriages by carrying out a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been closed so far.
More than 55-60 thousand bank accounts have been opened in the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (Urban) in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run to educate every girl child in every village.
With the help of your Child Apna Vidyalaya campaign, Rajasthan has been running a campaign to re-enroll the school going children without completing their education and encourage them to study.
New visions are also linked to this.
It has been modified as per local requirement.
You are actively associated with it.
I can learn a lot from you.
What is happening in the world, the thinking of the poor people of the village reaches me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors had moulded our cycle, economic structure and social system in such a way that there was no relaxation in life.
In the last few days, we have celebrated many festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Sri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Sri Krishna is such a person who, even after thousands of years, has created inspiration, inspiration and new energy in every festival, which is our imagination.
He can still be an example of solving any problem and can inspire people.
Any person can solve any of the current problems from the life of Sri Krishna.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, it can be said that Sarathy is ready to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes you can climb mountains and sometimes you can feel dizziness about food .
Today, when I am talking to you, my heart is moving towards two Mohans.
Mohan with a handsome wheel, Mohan with a charcoal.
Mohan, who had a handsome wheel, left the banks of the Yamuna river and traveled to Dwarka town on the coast of Gujarat and lived the last day of his life in Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna, born on the seashore.
Thousands of years ago, Mohan, who had a handsome cycle, used his intellect, duties, courage and thought to avoid war.
My dear countrymen, I recall the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October, 1869, there was only one person born on the shore of Porbandar, who was called Kirti Mandir, who showed a new path to human history and created a new excellence.
He served the workers who were not eligible for their wages.
He considered serving the poor, helpless, sick and hungry as one of his duties.
He himself served the leprosy victims to prove the illusions of common people about leprosy and to inspire others.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to run away to help him.
He not only emphasized the importance of service but also understood the importance of satisfaction at service.
The word 'Seva' can only be meaningful if it is done with joy only then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But at the same time, the real pleasure of 'Santa Sukhai' is inherent in the spirit of service.
We can easily understand this by observing Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and societies, humans and humanity were the only thoughts.
Whether it is the Phoenix Farm of Africa or the Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he emphasized on community mobilisation for social development.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to pay my respects at various workplaces of revered Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhiji gave importance to organizational energy along with the spirit of service.
We want to use both the ideas of social service and social integration, community service and community mobilisation in our lives.
Would you like to come and go A-What can we accept
There will be no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I went to Dandi of Gujarat.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions etc. will be organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news.
Haripura panels were specially enthusiastic.
You remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in the history of the Congress Presidential election.
These Art Panels have a beautiful past.
Prior to the Congress Haripura Session, 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited Nandlal Bose, the then Speaker of Santiniketan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase it during the Art Work session.
This is the art of Nandlal Bose whose art is the glory of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the constitution.
This practice of his art has immortalised the Constitution as well as Nandlal Bose.
Nandlal Bose inspected the villages around Haripur and then made some start-ups about rural India.
This precious sculpture was discussed in Venice.
Once again, on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I appeal to every Indian to make some or some other solemn pledge.
We need to do something for the country, for the society, for the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true tribute to Bapu.
Children of Mother India, you must remember that in the last few years, we have been running the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it starts from 11th September.
This time we have to put special emphasis on plastic.
There is a lot of enthusiasm among all the people of the society about this campaign.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have placed a placard in a store where it says that the buyer brings his bag with his bag.
It will also save money and also showcase its partnership in protecting the environment.
On October 2nd, when Bapu will commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate ourselves to the nation free of open defecation but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic.
I would like to appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to the mafia and to the people of the city, to join hands and pray that this year's Gandhi Jayanti should be celebrated in a way to free this mother India from plastic waste.
May 2nd October be a special day.
It can be recycled.
It can also be used as fuel.
There is no need to see it here for inspiration. No one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspiring.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is well-planned, a gem of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch upon an important issue through a Sanskrit well-being. It is an article written in the past but it still has a huge significance.
Stupid stones are called gems.
Our culture has a lot of glory.
We have also transformed the knowledge of foodgrains into science.
We all need sweet and nutritious food, especially for women and newborn babies.
People are fighting malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
On the day of harvesting of crops, the servants of Anganwadi used to collect one handful of crops.
These foods were used for making hot food for children and women.
He said that the donor has become an aware citizen and a social worker.
Thereafter, he dedicated himself towards this goal and became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, it was thought that the children should be given complementary food at the Annaprashan programme so that the people are aware about it.
It is a great initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states, people celebrate the 'Teethi Bhojan' campaign.
If a family has a birthday or a happy day or a memorial, then the family members should go to anganwadi, school and the family members should serve their children and feed their children and share their joys and joys.
There is a strange mix of service and joy.
Friends, There are several small issues that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has left an impact on the families of the poor and the rich.
POSHAN Abhiyaan will be observed throughout the country in September.
You must be associated with this mission, collect information and add new ideas.
If you protect each and every person from malnutrition, it means that our country will also be protected from malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that a lot of questions would be raised about this thing and that is what happened.
In the last few weeks, wherever I have visited and wherever I have met, there is a reference to Man Vs Wild.
With this episode, I have not only been able to connect with India but also with the youth of every part of the world. I have never imagined that such a place will be created in the minds of the youth.
I have never imagined how bizarre the youth of our country and the world are looking at.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I feel.
Tigers, Lions, creatures, I am surprised to know how many things people can motivate.
I am confident that the people are now seeking to know about the steps taken for climate justice environment in India.
Is it edited later
Look, it's not a mystery.
Some people have questions about it, so I'm exposing this mystery.
Actually, it's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to listen to English because of this conversation became very easy and that's the compelling thing for technology.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must visit natural and wildlife and places affected by nature and wildlife.
I told you, I repeat, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will be enlarged.
On 15th August, from the Red Fort, I had requested all of you to visit 15 places for tourism in the next three years, to visit 15 places for tourism, to discuss, to take family and to spend some time there.
Your life will enhance your thoughts.
Last month, it was fortunate to issue Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know the number of tigers in India
India has 2967 tigers.
Half of it used to be difficult a few years ago.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
A resolution was taken here expressing concern over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
This solemn pledge will double the number of tigers in the entire world by 2022.
But this is a New India, where we have achieved the goal very soon.
We have doubled the number of tigers by 2019.
In India, not only the number of tigers but also the number of Projected Areas and Community Reserves has increased.
When I was publishing the Tiger Samarita, I also remembered the lion of Gir forest in Gujarat.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the house of a lion was shrinking in the jungle of Gir.
Their numbers were declining.
We made a lot of entrepreneurs in Gir.
I decided to appoint a female guard in 2007.
Infrastructure facilitates tourism development.
Regarding nature and wildlife, we focus only on conservation and conservation.
This time we have to think and think in terms of compassion and compassion by removing the obstacles in conservation.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic address of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September 1893
The young Indian monk reacted to the brilliant speeches of the Indian monk across the globe.
The world was compassionate when India was at the threshold of the world. In 1893, the world was compelled to invent a new India in the word of great Swami Vivekananda.
Come, let us build the India that Swami Vivekananda saw, the power that he knew.
On this occasion, we are going to launch a nationwide Fit India Movement.
We have to keep ourselves fit, make the country fit.
This will be an attractive campaign for all of you, old and old.
But today I am not detailed in this regard.
Wait on August 29.
2nd October for Totally Dedicated Plastic.
With our utmost strength, we will join the campaign to keep our homes and surroundings free of plastic.
I am sure this mission will create chaos on social media.
Let us begin this campaign with a new zeal, new resolutions and new energy.
I'm waiting for your message and advice.
May our hearts be enlightened with the spell of joy and service.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January, 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, is a reflection of the economic reforms that make the next generation aware of democracy, the responsibility of democracy and reform.
However, the more debates should be made about the duties of citizens and the officers of citizens in our country, the more depth and brutality it should be, the more it should be practiced, the more it should not happen.
I hope that at every level, at every moment, the more emphasis is placed on the rights, the more stressed.
India's democracy can proceed on both rights and duties.
Tomorrow, January 30, 2019, marks our Punyapur Punya Tithi.
We salute the brave martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by observing a 2 minute silence at 11 am on 30 January 2019.
As a united society, as a nation, we should become a common habit of paying a two minute tribute on January 30, 2019 at 11 pm.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with the Bravery Index Awards.
All these awards include 'Kirti Chakra', 'Saurachakra', 'Param Vishisht Seva Medal' and 'Visht Seva Medal'.
I would particularly like to appeal to the youngsters. Are you very active on social media
Please appreciate the contributions of those who have been honored with this honour by searching on the Internet and reaching out to their friends.
When we get to know about their courage, courage and valour in detail, we are astonishing as we are, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when all of us were happy with the warmth and enthusiasm of 26th January, our soldiers in Kashmir who were steadfast in the security of the country, who lost their lives due to snowstorms.
I pay my homage and homage to these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you know very well that I am constantly listening to Manki Baat.
January, February, March, April-All Months of Examination
One-half or two children of the world are tested but the entire family is under the pressure of examination.
Family anxiety, student anxiety, teacher anxiety - a very strange psychological atmosphere is seen in every world.
And I have always believed that we should get out of this and that is why today I want to talk to young friends in detail about this thing.
When I announced this thing, a lot of teachers, parents, students sent me a message, they asked me questions, they asked me questions, they wrote about pain, they mentioned the anxiety and after seeing this I felt like sharing it with you today.
On the telephone I sent a message from Creator.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but you all have the same question.
The test must be a pleasure.
We have worked hard throughout the year, we have got the opportunity to know this thing, it should be a celebration of hope and enthusiasm.
You have to make a decision that you think it pressure, not pleaseure.
And when the festival is celebrated, the best thing that comes out of us.
It is during the festival that society reverberates in its own strength.
There should be a festive atmosphere in the family, friends and parents during the examination.
The entire family should celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm and zeal as a team and see how fast the changes take place.
The truth is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh these three-four months are just tests and tests.
It is the responsibility of each one of us that these three-four months, in their own way, by adopting their own traditions, by understanding the environment of their families, by converting them into a festival.
And so I'll tell you 'smile more score more'.
And you've seen yourself relaxed when you enjoy yourself, joying yourself.
You remember the whole scene of what the teacher said in Classroom a year ago.
Sometimes we feel that we cannot see the exams in the right direction.
I guess it's a life-long question.
The test means that you've been studying all year.
J.
A shining example of the Christian era.
He wanted to join the Air Force but was inadequate.
Just imagine, if he used to get disappointed after this failure, if he used to go away then would India find such a great scientist - such a President
This has not only increased the competition among children, but also increased the tension.
I would like to share your views on the current situation and future of the education system.
What you really have in life is your knowledge, your skills, your spiritual belief and your determination.
You think he's a good doctor, so you need to go to him.
When you go to a Namukil at the time of the big case, do you look for his marksheet
You see his experience, his wisdom and success.
And that is why sometimes the burden of this number becomes the instinct for us to follow the right path.
Introspection shows that only when you run for numbers, you find the easiest way and focus on specific things, but whenever you face any problem outside this trough, you become uncomfortable.
And that is why sometimes we face failing in our lives due to extremely successful activity in the examination.
One more thing that Richa has raised is competition.
It's an area of great mental conflict.
We can give the example of Sachin Tendulkar in this regard.
Friends, in every aspect of life and especially when you're going to take the exams, take care that if you had to spend two hours to study, have you done that for three hours
Whenever I used to think about getting up earlier, I would still be late. Can you get up on time
Speaking on the occasion, Shri S.
That's how he helped me.
My mother didn't pass the 10th Century examination but if she didn't get help, I wouldn't have passed the CBSE examination.
Beautiful-yes, you're right.
You must have noticed that there is a large number of women who give me questions and advice.
If you learn to admit once, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't accept this, you'll find a way out of this problem.
Hope makes the road harder.
Acknowledging the present situation gives an opportunity to open up new solutions.
So confess to what you have.
Look, you're gonna be weightless.
We talk about the weight of the school bag of small children but sometimes I believe that the parents' aspirations are more than the school bags.
Several years ago, one of our familiar men was in hospital because of heart attack.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear of disease in his mind.
I want to tell the parents that sometimes we stay with the younger ones like this.
Have you ever thought that during the test days, I would give a smile to the children.
You'll see the situation will change.
I've got a funny phone.
The gentleman didn't mean to say his name.
On hearing the details of the phone, you will understand why that person doesn't want to reveal his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I did something in my childhood that I could not mention my name.
I tried to duplicate once when I was a kid.
I wasted a lot of time thinking about how to duplicate and what to do.
I could get the same number if I spent it for studying.
When I tried to duplicate and pass, I was caught and many friends around me had a problem for me.
I repeat your story.
So where are you going to reach
Just imagine, you yourself are digging your own way, creating obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and using creative energy to find ways to duplicate.
If I talk about sports during the examination then everyone will say - what kind of Prime Minister
This is because the common man believes that students will be unconscious about sports.
Besides the brain the other body should have proper activity .
If you take a brake for five minutes, you'll feel too much in your studies.
I don't know if everyone would like this, but I told you about my belief.
Once a folk singer came to see me.
He asked me how long you slept
I wanted to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, "No, no, you don't tell me, it's related to him when you lose your neck to give this speech.
If you sleep properly, your morning cord will rest.
I've never thought of my sleeping and throats before.
He gave me a simple trick.
Don't do that, so your feelings will be unhappy with me.
Otherwise, the day the marksheet comes, the parents will see my image instead of you.
If you lie down then it will work. Don't think at all.
Sports also plays an important role in keeping mind, intelligence and body functioning.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February this year.
Congratulations to every personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their commitment to the nation on this occasion.
Our Coast Guard, along with 126 warships and 62 aircraft built in our country, has made the world's top four Coast Guards proud.
Keeping in mind the commitment of the Coast Guards Mantra of Imam Rocksham, our Coast Guard has always been in adversity to safeguard the coastal areas of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard had planned to clean the seashores of our country along with their mainstream and thousands of people participated in it.
We have women pilots at the Coast Guard, and they are capable of handling the cannons of the Hovercraft.
Spring Huturaj.
Saraswati is worshipped in Basant-Panchami.
For learning, we are raised for worship.
It is not only learning but also a celebration of valour.
Mare Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on this spring festival.
My dear countrymen, All India Radio has imbibed the Mann Ki Baat programme with a lot of popular thinking.
Last month, my Mann Ki Baat address was followed by Mann Ki Baat in regional language.
This effort has achieved great success.
The countrymen have written letters from far and wide.
I convey my best wishes to them for this self-motivation initiative of AIR.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is the day to remember service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus, the savior, said, It is not good for the poor, it is our recognition for them.
There's a very popular story about it.
Lord Jesus once stood by the Temple Treasury.
Many rich men came and donated a lot.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and donated two copper coins.
On the one hand, two copper coins donate no money.
On the birth anniversary of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malviya ji, Malviya ji had given a new direction to the modern education system that was awakened by the resolve and self-confidence of the people of India.
On his birth anniversary, I pay my homage to Bhav-Gambi.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development projects at Malviyas Tapabhumi Banaras.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mohammati Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Benares Hindu University.
A cancer centre is being set up for this entire region and it will benefit not only the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of India Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, the country's head on nuclear energy has also risen.
Atal ji set an ideal for every role as a leader, MP, Minister or Prime Minister.
I bow to Atal ji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as an employee.
A lot of memories are floating in front of the eyes.
I shared an old video this morning when I had tweeted that how Atal ji's affection towards a small worker was showered.
As a Christmas gift, all the people of the country are going to get the benefits of two schemes today.
Everyone wants to understand and learn to each other.
In order to encourage this thing, to increase the power of mobile banking and to make e-payment a habit, the Government of India is launching a encouraging scheme for consumers and small businesses.
The scheme for encouraging consumers is the 'Laki Grahak Yojana' and 'Business Professionals' Yojana - 'Dig-Dhan Vapar Yojana'.
As a Christmas gift on 25th December, 15,000 people will be deposited in an account of Rs.
Today it is not just for one day but it will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 persons per day.
Crores of rupees will be available to lakhs of families in 100 days but only those who have mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay cards, UPI will be eligible for this gift.
Use the digital payments systems like USSD, etc.
DG-Dhan Vapar Yojana is for businessmen.
Just as the businessmen themselves associate themselves with this scheme, they will also include the customers to cash their businesses.
The awards will be given separately to the traders and will be thousands of awards.
These awards will not be available for those who can make purchases worth more than Rs. 3000.
The poor can sell Feature phones and common phones through USSD and can also avail the benefits of the scheme.
People from rural areas will be able to win this award by selling it through AEPS.
In your family, a child of ten or twelve classes can also teach you this method.
It's a simple thing to send from mobile phones to WhatsApps.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know how to use technology in the country, how to use e-payment and how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless trade has grown by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this method.
Businessmen can easily guess how big this decision is.
All the traders who will make digital transactions, instead of cash in their business, will be exempted from their income tax.
I am aware that the Government of Assam has announced a 10 discount on payment of Property Tax and Business License Fee digitally.
Grameen Bank branches have decided that at least 75 of their subscribers will get Rs. 50,000 for digital transactions from January to March.
As on 31st March, 2017, if any village has 100 Digital Transactions, the Government of Assam has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh under the Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transaction Scheme.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give Rs. 5000 prizes to the first 10 farmers under the Digital Farmers' Shiromani scheme, who are fully pursuing digital processes for procurement of seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the states that have taken such initiatives.
Funny, GNFC fertilizers have grown by 27 over the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, there is an unorganized sector in our everyday life.
Most of these people are paid wages, money for work or salaries in cash, and we know that workers are deprived of it.
80 was given in lieu of Rs. 100, when Rs. 80 was paid, Rs. 50 was disbursed and deprived of other benefits, including health insurance like insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is directly deposited in the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is accessible to us.
Countries like India should be the frontrunner in these areas.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity, our younger generation should take up new ideas, new technologies and new techniques as much as possible in this field.
We have to join hands in the drive to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people before every 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, you send your suggestions, you give your suggestions and this time thousands of opinions have been suggested on MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
The authors of the second group, who laid emphasis on all these things, work for the betterment of the country, work for the betterment of the country, however, have given a detailed account of the kind of frauds and frauds that have been committed against them.
Smt. Gurumani Keobal has written in MyGov: This step is commendable for pulling black money.
As citizens, our problems are right, but we are happy that we are cooperating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in fighting corruption, black money etc.
The same feeling has emerged from every corner of the country.
All of us can feel it.
In fact, these are the agents of change.
I would like to thank everyone for one more reason not only for the difficulties faced by them but also for giving a befitting reply to those who are trying to mislead the common man.
Not only this, some people have also brought out the masks of those rumors and rumors with their wisdom, their power and their creativity and brought the truth to the fore.
I salute this power of the people.
Peoples generosity is Gods blessings and the blessings of people are Gods blessings.
I thank the people of the country, I salute the people of this country for taking part in this grand campaign against corruption and black money.
I wanted that the kind of fight against corruption and black money should be discussed in detail in Parliament as well as in political funding.
Those who are pursuing political parties have a lot of discounts are wrong.
This government is the government of the people.
On the other hand, I had told you on 8th day that this is a wonderful fight.
More and more information is received from the public.
The success that we have achieved is due to the public awareness.
Can anybody imagine how much our conscious citizens are risking to open their masks
Your help will make this fight easier.
Those who are sending letters to me have a third party, many of them.
They say that Modi ji will not stop, he will not get tired, take as much hard work as possible.
We have to win this war, we're not tired.
We have brought it out and strictly enacted the Benami Property Act.
This law will play its role in the coming days.
What is patriotic and patriotic is our primary duty.
In the past, India has gloriously established itself in many areas of the world economy.
As per the World Investment Report released by UNCTAD, India has jumped to 3rd position in 2016-18 Top Prospective Host Economy.
India has improved 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In the same vein, Indias ranking in the World Banks Logistics Performance Index-2016 is 19.
Similarly, India has shown rapid progress in several other reports.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of the Parliament has created warmth among the people of the country.
Their anger over the proceedings of the House has been enraged in various ways.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their appreciation in this regard.
But sometimes something good happens in these things and the mind gets filled with joy.
A good work has been done in the hailstorm of the Parliament which has not been noticed by the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am glad to note that a Bill has been passed in the Parliament for the welfare of persons with disabilities.
Our government is committed to the Divyangjans.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to this effort when they won four medals at the Para Olympics.
This victory has not only enhanced the dignity of the country, its strength has surprised the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, these Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable wealth and strength.
I am happy today that the passage of this Act will provide more employment opportunities to the Divyangjans.
Reservation limit for Government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act provides for provision of education, facilities and grievances for the persons with disabilities.
The government has enacted this new law as per the UNs vision.
Certain compilations have been made for persons with disabilities to get suitable opportunities and justice for the first time.
Persons with Thalassemia, Perkinsons and Dwarves are also involved in this category.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there has been such news from the field of sports that we all feel proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
Indian cricket team won 4-0 against England.
The performance of some young athletes is highly commendable.
Test test test test test Venus Kohli did not just do good work, he also led a good leadership.
I convey my best wishes to all of them.
Even in Haqi, good news has been received after 15 years.
I congratulate these young sportspersons for their success.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey team.
Our women sportspersons have achieved extraordinary success last month.
The Indian womens hockey team won the Asian Championships Trophy, and the Indian womens hockey team won the Bronze medal at the 18th Asia Cup a few days ago.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the players of cricket and hockey team.
My dear countrymen, be the year of new hope and enthusiasm in 2017.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We all celebrated Diwali last month.
Like every year during Deepawali, I went to the China border to pay tributes to the army.
Deepavali Festival along with the jawans of ITBP is being celebrated in high altitude Himalayas.
I go to the border every year, but this time Deepawali's experience is completely different.
They were full of that sentiment and I was witnessing a strange reaction to the kind of greetings and good wishes that the countrymen had conveyed to them.
When I was watching these things, I was surprised to think of what a wonderful imagination he was.
But, to be honest, don't we feel like this during this festival of Diwali
On the contrary, I felt like joining the celebrations of Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the warmth, joy, affection and joy that have spread among the soldiers of our Armed Forces should not be limited to Holi-Deepawali alone.
As a society, as a nation, as a nation, as a nation, as a part of nature and as a festival, we will remember the soldiers of our Armed Forces in some way or the other.
When the nation is united with the Armed Forces, the strength of the Armed Forces will increase by 125 crores.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had met me.
He was here to attend the Panchayat Sammelan in Jammu and Kashmir.
Nearly 40-50 chiefs came from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
I had a chance to talk for a long time.
Even though they have made some claims for the development and development of the villages, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the laws and the future of the children have come up in a natural way.
A few days ago, the board examined Kashmir and nearly 95 of the students appeared in the examination.
I can clearly see the participation of students in this vast exam in the board exams that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are steadfastly committed to the development of a bright future through education.
I express my gratitude to not only the students but also their parents, parents, teachers and above all the village heads for their commitment.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I had asked people's discussions about Mann Ki Baat this time, I admit that everyone has made a single proposal.
Everyone wants me to say something in detail with a note of Rs.500.
On the 8th of November, I had announced a massive campaign for the development of the country.
The time I made this decision and made it clear to you, it was not an ordinary decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of the decision making, I had warned that the effect of the implementation of this proposal would be so cumbersome that it would take at least 50 days to get out of it and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
It's not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
25 billion Indians have unwavering faith and confidence in their country that they are committed to devotion for the development of the country.
And that is why we have succeeded and the banks and the post office staff are working in adversity.
And when it comes to humanity, they must be getting more active.
When the local bank employees heard about it, they had taken it to the old gentleman's house.
Not only this, he has arranged for medical treatment.
I was amazed at this incident.
They're taking legal measures to save their black money.
Don't play with the poor people to fulfil their unjust interests.
Your unfair earnings are incorporated in the records of the poor, not you after the investigation. These poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
Strict regulations have been made to enhance the coverage of Benami Property, which are being implemented in all areas.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tehsil, Tehsil and Tirli in Madhya Pradesh.
It is a commendable step towards this 500-thousand notebook of yours.
I urge you people to do something through Mann Ki Baat, where the common man is facing a lot of difficulties and yet welcoming you for the development of the nation.
Thank you sincerely, you said that Sudin is coming, but no one thought that you could take such a big step.
By closing the notes of 500 and thousands, you have taught corrupt black people the right way.
Every citizen of India has no longer a big day.
I thank you once again for this.
He said that when we hear such news through media, public and governmental sources, the spirit of working becomes very high.
People have eaten there, and they've cleared the bill after two or four days.
This is the strength of my country, where servitude and sacrifice are the mainstream of religion.
The news that I used to talk about during the elections was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world also learnt how to use the word 'Chai-Betak'.
But I did not know that there could be a dinner in the village.
I got the news that such a marriage took place on November 14th.
In this marriage, only tea was arranged for the invitees, there was no feeding and feeding programme because they lacked cash due to the closure of the notes.
Through such marriages, Bharat Maru and Dakshina Parmar have set an example in the fight against corruption and black money.
Whenever there is a crisis, people find a new way and once I get to know about the incident in Dhekiyajuli village of Assam on TV.
Weekly wages are available to tea and labourers in the village.
The neighbouring four ladies worked together and made a payment of Rs. 2,000 each.
You are well aware of the fact that even the poorest of the poor deposits the minimum amount two days ago.
Only fifty percent of the taxes of every municipality fall.
But after the announcement of the 8th, Jamdewar Hidike, which is outstanding in the old notes, falls among people.
You will be surprised to know that during the last year when Rs. 3000 crores were deposited in taxes, you would be surprised to know that Rs.
We are witnessing such multiplications, the direct results of which are visible to us.
Brothers and sisters, Villages and farmers are the backbone of our economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmer brothers and sisters of the country when we are adjusting every citizen despite the difficulties faced by this change in the economy.
I was calculating sowing seeds this year.
I am glad to see that wheat, pulses and sesame numerals have grown over the years.
Farmer brothers and sisters have taken up new paths in all odds.
Some important decisions have also been taken by the government, where the priorities of the treasurers and the villages are being taken.
Six businessmen of our country also create employment opportunities and also contribute to economic development.
I had made an important decision in the last year's budget that even small shopkeepers in villages like the big malls of the city will be able to do business for 24 hours and no law will stop them.
Under the MUDRA Yojana, adequate entrepreneurship has been taken to provide loans to them.
Millions of crores of rupees have been disbursed to these small traders under the Mudra Yojana because the small traders who are engaged in this small business are making transactions worth crores of rupees.
But due to this decision, it is natural for all the small businessmen to face difficulties.
Download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Machine POS Machine for Credit Cards and learn how to do business without notes.
You have seen that the big malls continue to do business through technology.
Similarly, a small businessman can also handle businesses with the help of a simple UserFriendly technology.
There is no possibility of any erosion, there is a chance to grow.
I urge you all to join us in creating a Cashless Society.
You can take full banking services on mobile phones to expand your business and keep pace with cash note transactions.
These are technological solutions that are safe, secure and fast.
I want you to not only help in achieving this mission but also in associating your leadership.
I am confident that you will be able to finish all the business transactions in your village through technology.
I would also like to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
The paper says a salary and what is being paid in hand is different.
Sometimes it was found that someone was standing outside, he had to split and labour forcefully accepted this absorption as a part of life.
In today's new system, we want your bank accounts to be deposited with your remuneration bank so that the minimum wage conditions are adjusted.
Like you get the full amount, no one cuts it.
Today, I want to talk specially to my young friends.
India is a country where 65 per cent of the population is below 35 years of age.
You, the youth of my country, I know that you liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision.
I am also aware that you will contribute a lot to take this thing forward positively.
But, guys, you're my true soldier, my true friend.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, that's not gonna work.
The concept of today's world is not of older generations.
Perhaps even the elder brothers of your family don't know so much about Arma-Paba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mami.
You know how to book App Keysing, Online Banking, Online Tickets.
This is a very common thing for you and you also use it.
But today the country wants to do great things, our dream is Cashless Society.
It's true that 100 percent of the Cashless Society is not possible.
But once we start laser-cash societies, the goal of the Cashless Society will not be undermined.
And I want your active cooperation, time and resolve in this regard and I know that you will never disappoint me because we are all citizens of the country who want to change the lives of the poor people of India.
You know how many opportunities today are for Cashless Societies, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Each bank offers an online facility.
Every bank has its own mobile app in Hindustan.
Every bank has its own wallet.
Whitewater means E-Manibag.
There's a lot of cardpaws.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, there are RuPay cards with crores of poor families in India which used to be very rarely used.
Since 8th, the poor people have been using his pulses and it has increased by almost three hundred percent.
The pre-paid cards available on mobile phones are also available for banking expenditure.
And it's as simple as your WhatsApp.
Phones with simple features can also cause cash transfers.
Whether it is smoke or vegetables, milk, newspapers, tea, chew sellers, everyone can use it.
And I also stressed the need to simplify this system.
All banks are working on it.
My young friends, despite all this, there are generations who are not familiar with this.
And AnarasBi, I know very well, this great work is active.
The kind of creative messages that you give on the WhatsApp - slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, smiles, new ideas and smiles, the creative power of the younger generation in the face of the challenges.
Similarly, when we are bringing about such a massive change then the basic creativity within you is reflected.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help, I am confident that you, millions and millions of youngsters of the country will do this.
Please do one thing. Please make a pledge from today that you yourself will be a part of the Cashless Society.
You can use all the online technologies you have on your mobile phone.
Moreover, everyday half an hour, an hour or two, at least 10 families will be able to understand the technology, how to download this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in their accounts and how to provide it to the buyer.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will have to give leadership to the great campaign of eliminating corruption, the campaign to free the country from black money, the campaign to free the people from misery and misery.
I invite you to come forward and not only support but also to become a soldier of this change and to give up.
We will take this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are so many countries in the world where the younger generation has changed the lifestyle of that country and it must be realized that the changes that take place are brought about by the youngsters and the youth.
Kenya has created a mobile system called M-PESA, used technology, named M-PESA, and today Africa has made the entire business in Kenya in this region a turning point.
This country has brought about a major revolution.
My youngsters, once again I am very keen to take this mission forward.
I invite all the schools, colleges, universities, NC-C and NS-S to work collectively and at the individual level.
You have seen that the most popular actor of this period, Amitabh ji has been taking the cleanliness drive very hard.
My dear countrymen, now through Manki Baat, your thoughts, your emotions and your emotions are reaching and connecting me with you on the Narendra Modi App in MyGov.
Now Mann Ki Baat is being published at 11. 00 A.
I am grateful to All India Radio for taking this new initiative so that the countrymen can get the opportunity to connect everywhere in Hindi language.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
Deepawali is celebrated with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is a country that has witnessed some festival in some part of the country for 365 days.
We have simply acknowledged the changes in festivals as per the time and societies by the end of many traditional festivals.
However, we can clearly see that in India, the journey of the festival, its depth, its impact on every individual for years, all these things are connected with the same basic mantra - taking the individual towards the world.
Efforts are being made to enhance individuals and personalities, and expand their limited thinking from the Paris society to the universe.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes India is considered a festival of food and beverages, but it also has a thought-provoking festival and what should be eaten there.
Our ancestors have combined the scientific ideas of how the crops are being harvested by the farmers and how they can be linked to the festivals.
Today, the entire world is thinking about the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals has strengthened nature-loving, from childhood to goodwill to every person.
And science has proved that the changes that take place in the sea waters of Purnima and Amavasya, the impact of things on nature, and the impact of it on the minds of people.
So far, our vacation has been a tradition of nurturing science with the universe.
Today, when we are celebrating the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is educational, it brings in the spirit of learning.
The festival of Deepawali conveys the message of 'Tamsoma Azimagmaye' from darkness.
Deepawali is a celebration of social faults, freedom from the shadow of individual faults, and the light from darkness.
We all know this thing very well that cleanliness drives every family during Diwali, from Dhani to Dhani Ghar or the hut of the poorest of the poor.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government, the parliament, the rulers and the rulers of every corner of the world became a part of the festival of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, Instagram, shared the portrait of celebrating the festival of Deepawali with the entire world with pride.
As many as sixteen women members of the Singapore Parliament, after Indian saris, stood outside the Parliament and portrayed them on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Diwali.
Deepavali Festival is celebrated everywhere in Singapore.
The festival of Deepawali inspires everyone from darkness to light.
The news of the accident during Diwali, the news of the firefighters, the news of the humiliation caused a lot of anxiety.
During Deepawali, a lot of doctors went to Deepawali to celebrate Deepawali with their families.
It continues for a long time not just from one day but from Govardhan Puja, Bhaiphota, Lava-Panchami to Karthik-Purima.
It is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But it has a special significance. It gives a deep message to the society.
There is a proverb that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhath Puja is a festival where the setting sun is worshipped.
It has a very big social message.
I recall the festival of Deepawali, Chhat Pooja and I convey my best wishes to all of you on this occasion. This is the time to express my gratitude and gratitude to all of you.
In the last few months, every soldier of our army has sacrificed everything for our sleep.
In my view, the sacrifices, meditation and hard work of the personnel of the Armed Forces have a special effect.
And that is why I felt that this Deepavali should be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the countrymen to take part in a campaign called Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I would like to bow down to my head that there is no such person in India who does not have immense affection for the country's army, who is proud of the army, who is not proud of the defence forces.
The way people have published it will further strengthen the countrymen.
We cannot imagine the strength of the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy or the Air Force, or the Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all.
When we are nurturing Diwali then some of them are in the desert, some are in the heights of the Himalayas, some are protecting the arts, some are protecting the airports and they are fulfilling their responsibilities.
I really want to express my gratitude to the countrymen.
The artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the composer of the poem, whom Saraswati has been pleased with.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
SANDESHTESH TO SOLDIERS - This hashtag has a very bitter message.
Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has written a poem, I would like to read it.
I will celebrate the festival, Sadam, I will tell you today, it's possible that you're here.
My dear countrymen, whose father's house and father-in-law's family have sent me a telephone message.
Come, let us listen to this family. Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers and sisters have been encouraged by the campaign Sandesh to Siljars which was launched in this Diwali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the army officers.
This sensitivity has inspired all the officers of the Army Circle who are on the border.
I would like to say that along with the army officers and the soldiers, their wives and the entire family have to sacrifice a lot.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not only on the borders but also on the various facets of their lives.
Whether it is natural calamities or administrative calamities or fighting the enemies or bringing the wrong guided youth back in the right direction, our brave soldiers keep pace with the patriotic fervour in all walks of life.
The discussion shows that some families are not able to build toilets in their homes due to lack of funds.
Vikas Thakur has empowered the cleanliness drive by paying one thousand rupees to 57 families from his pocket.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an Open Defecation Free State.
Nobody goes there easily.
The youngsters walked on foot with bricks, cement and other toilet items on their shoulders.
In Gujarat, more than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared open defecation free.
Ten districts have also been included in the list.
My dear countrymen, the government has planned a lot and if there is a better plan after the first plan, then the first one has to be abolished.
Normally, no one pays attention to it.
There is no need for kerosene in all the households that have gas connections and electricity.
But who's looking for arrows in the government
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been freed from kerosene.
The way they have taken this initiative, I believe that the entire state will soon become kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide to all of us.
What the country will do, how to do it, all his ideas are still considered as examples.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a plan then you will remember the poor and weaker sections of the country and then you will realise that what you are going to do will be of any benefit to these people or not, will there be no harm to them
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our old ideas may be, we have to discriminate between boys and girls in our society.
This opportunity is a testimony to our daughters' distinction in Indian society.
Though immunization is being carried out by the government, lakhs of children are still left out of the immunization programme and are afflicted with diseases.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is one such campaign, which involves children who have been immunized, which enables children to get rid of serious diseases.
The village will be dark in the 21st century, that doesn't happen.
The campaign to provide electricity to the villages and to free the villages from the bottom of the pyramid is progressing successfully.
Work is going on before the deadline.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and this campaign is progressing successfully.
Small traders, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk sellers, dairy vendors get stuck on loans to the Mahajan.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-Up Scheme and Jan Dhan Account are all a successful mission of freedom from the beneficiaries.
Financial benefits are being given directly to the bank through Aadhaar Card and to the genuine winners.
It is time for the common man to get rid of the evils of brokers.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great prince of this country, who had inspired and demonstrated the unity of India, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
On 31st October, 2019, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the great leader of the nation's unity, and the sacred death anniversary of Smt.
Sir, you know that October 31, 2019 is Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel is such a person who has spent his entire life for the integrity of the country and I think that he has succeeded in this direction.
He has united everyone and we can say the misfortune of the country or that day the assassination of Indira Gandhi was also done.
And we all know what happened to the country after his assassination.
Sir, I want to tell you how we can stop such misfortune events.
My dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to this incident and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the nation after Chanakya.
But this is also a sadness that Sardar Saheb had dedicated his life for the sake of unity, fought for the main objective of unity of the country and had suffered so much dissatisfaction.
But on the birth anniversary of Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were pushed to death after the killing of Mrs. Gandhi.
On the birth anniversary of the great soul who spent his entire life for unity, atrocities against the Sardar Saheb, this page of history troubles us all.
But even in this crisis, the mantra of unity has to be taken forward.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, dresses, food habits, but unity in diversity is India's strength, India's specialty.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government has a responsibility, every corner of the country is an example of unity and we develop the policy of unity of the country.
We should protect ourselves and ourselves from the tendency of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb gave us 'Ek Bharat'. It is our responsibility to build a 'Shreshtha Bharat'.
The main mantra of unity is to build a Shreshtha Bharat.
At present, we have heard the name of AMUL.
Today people from all over India and abroad are also familiar with every product of AMUL.
But few people know that the visionary Sardar Saheb had envisioned the creation of a cooperative producer.
The Kheda district, which was known as the Kheda district of 1942, emphasized on this concept and in its true sense, we have a live example of what Sardar Saheb had done for the betterment of the farmers.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, wherever we live, we will remember Sardar Saheb and take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, Karthik Purnima after Diwali is also a part of the festival of light.
Guru Nanak ji's teachings show the right direction for the entire mankind, not only for India but for the entire mankind.
Seva, Truth and be good for everyone. This is the message of Guru Nanak.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his main mantra.
Guru Nanaks mission was to free the society from discrimination, blind faith and misery.
I also bow down to Guru Nanak from the hearts of the people on the auspicious occasion of Prakash Parv.
My dear countrymen, once again, I convey my best wishes to you all for this Deepavali dedicated in the name of our soldiers.
Your vision, however successful your resolve.
May your life be filled with joy and happiness. I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
A few days ago, we lost eighteen brave sons of the country in the attack on Uri sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage.
And that is why I will tell my countrymen that on that day, I will repeat what I said that the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in the army.
We are proud of our army.
I want to talk to the people of Kashmir specially today.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the forces of the country.
And whoever realizes the truth, Amni has switched away from that power and started walking on the path of peace.
All schools and colleges should be started in the fast and full moon day.
The farmers also want their fruits and crops to reach all the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, we have started doing business easier.
Peace, unity and goodwill are our way of solving all our problems, our path of progress and our development.
Our future generations will have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will work together to find solutions to all the problems, to find solutions and also to create a better way for the future generations of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
The administration has to make some arrangements to maintain law and order.
I would like to tell the lawmakers that we have the strength, the power, the law, the rules and regulations need to be maintained, to give the people of Kashmir a life of peace and happiness and to make full use of it.
Sometimes people think otherwise than we think.
I have a chance to know a lot about social media.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to understand the emotions of the people and enhances the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, an eleven-class student, sent me a different feeling.
He wrote: "I am very upset after the Uri attack.
I had this question in my mind that what can I do for patriotism
I made a solemn pledge that I will study for three more hours every day.
I will be a eligible citizen of the country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, I am delighted to know that in this atmosphere of anger and in such a young age you are able to think well.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried to convey this feeling to the world.
And he inspired the people with the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' and showed how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji showcased another way to show patriotism in the sounds of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to drive the movement, when there was a need to create a rapid, proactive approach to the movement, he used this movement with utmost success to unite the creative work within the society.
May the Armed Forces discharge their responsibilities, the people in the administration discharge their responsibilities and we the people of our country contribute towards this patriotism and contribute to a new height.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
S.
Karthik has written to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who went to Para-Olympics have written history and their victory is the victory of human spirit.
You two are not only an emotional attachment of every individual of the country but also an emotional attachment to the athletes who participated in Para-Olympics.
Perhaps, our perspective of para-olympics on the rise of sports and our sportspersons, from the point of view of humanity, from the point of view of the differently abled, has completely changed our perspective.
And I can't forget Deepa Malik, our winner.
When he won the medal, he said, "I have lost the handicap through this horror.
This has a lot of strength.
This time, nineteen athletes including three women from our country participated in the Para-Olympics.
If we compare the sports persons with disabilities with other sports, then physical talent and sporting tricks will be a big one.
You will be happy to know that our sportspersons have won four medals with their best performance in this field - two gold medals, one silver medal and one medal.
Gold medal winner Devendra Jhajharia brought gold medal for the second time after twelve years.
He grows older in twelve years, and once he gets a gold medal, he goes hungry.
But Devendra showed that the condition of the body, the growing age did not allow her determination to slumber and she won the gold medal after twelve years.
He wasn't a Divyang from birth.
He missed one of his hands because of electrical shocks.
Just imagine, the person who earned the first gold medal at the age of thirty years and the age of thirty-five years, how much he did in his life.
Mariappan won the gold medal at Thangavelu Hijamp.
Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty didn't hinder his commitment.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't come from a middle-class family.
In the 21st year of his life, he has brought medals to the nation in spite of physical problems and physical hardships.
Athlete Deepa Malik's name has been linked to many victories.
Varun C.
He won the Bronze medal at Bhati Hijamp.
In our country, in our society and around us, all these medals have played a crucial role in changing our vision for our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Very few people know what the Divyangjans have done in Para-Olympics this time.
A few days ago, the Olympics were held at the same place.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that the fourth person to be amongst the disabled persons who did not receive any medal, who ran in less time than the medal winners, once again I congratulate all our players.
In the coming days, India is moving towards a smooth plan for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, I had experienced a lot of surprising experience in Navsari last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The government of India has organised a Mega Camp for the Divyangjans.
There I met a little girl, Gaurishardul, who couldn't see her from the far-flung jungles of Dang district.
The government of India has established a world record on the land of Basari which is very important.
In 8 hours, it was possible to add machines to listen to those who could not hear.
The incident took place at the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen to set up three world records by the Divyangjans in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness, cleanliness and cleanliness should be our habits, every citizen should be duties, to create an atmosphere of hatred towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when we complete two years, I can assert with confidence that there is an increase in awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people.
Today, we can say that everybody has tried to take one step ahead.
That is, the country is moving towards 125 crore steps of cleanliness.
Therefore, every citizen, ruler, government department or road ghat, bus terminal or railway station, school-college, pilgrimage, hospital to old-age village poor, farmer woman has contributed something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we still have to move far away.
In order to be healthy, for the honour of the citizens, especially the honour of the mothers and sisters, the practice of open defecation must be stopped.
And that is why an Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaign has been started to save the lives of people from the habit of defecation.
I had visited Gujarat recently and officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the target of ODF on October 2 this year.
Congratulations to all those who have been successful in this endeavour, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have worked hard.
My condolences to the countrymen, for the honour of the mothers and sisters, and for the health of the small children, we will get rid of this problem.
Come on, let's make a solemn pledge and move forward.
I would like to introduce a new scheme for the young friends who are accustomed to using technology these days.
The Government of India has given a telephone number 1969 to ensure that everybody has the right to know about the status of Swachhta Mission in your city.
We are aware that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By calling this number 1969, you will not only be able to know the statistics of toilets in your city but you will also be able to make an appeal to build new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation, should take advantage of it.
The Government of India is calling upon Corporate Worlds to come forward and sponsor those who want to work for transparency.
They can be dispatched to the districts as Swachh Bharat workers.
And along with the Swachhta mission, we have to move forward towards Wasteto Compost.
The chemical surcompanies have been told to buy the compost from Waste.
The farmers who want to go to Organic Farming should get the required supplies.
Those who improve their soil health, those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers, if they need some such fertilizer then they should be supplied.
Shri Amitabh Bachan has joined as a brand ambassador for this work.
I have seen that there is a constant new news about cleanliness.
One day I was in the news paper- Students from Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to spread awareness about toilet construction.
The Government of India has also created one year calendar in its various fields.
Each department is focusing on hygiene for 15 days in particular.
I would like to appeal to the citizens that if you are connected to the work done by these government departments then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time more than one lakh population is driven to nearly five hundred cities.
This is the reason why the people of every city are getting the impression that we are lagging behind and we will do good next time.
A competition environment has been created in the field of cleanliness.
I hope that all the citizens will join this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is completing two years.
I urge you to buy something from Khadi to Deepawali from Gandhi Jayanti.
I would also request every family to buy Khadi products so that the light of Deepavali burns in the houses of the poor.
Though Sunday is 2nd October, however, can we take part in Swachhta Abhiyan somewhere or the other as a citizen
You should work hard for at least two-four hours in the field of cleanliness and share a photograph of it on the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, you can share that too.
Our collective efforts will give a boost to this movement and a new momentum.
Let us remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and resolve to do something good for the country.
Dear countrymen, it is a wonderful pleasure to donate a life of recognition.
In the last few days, I have also seen that when I had requested to give up the subsidy on gas, the way the common man responded was an inspiring event in our national life.
Some of our youth, small organisations, people from the corporate world, students and members of some voluntary organizations will join hands to celebrate the Joy of Giving Week in many cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
The campaign aims to provide food items, dresses and equipment to the underprivileged.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers visited different families and collected the old toys in their homes and handed them over to the poorest of the villages.
It was really a pleasure to see all those poor kids with these toys.
I believe that the enthusiastic youth of every city that will be celebrated as Joy of Giving Week will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of charity.
I convey my best wishes to all the youngsters who are doing this.
Dear countrymen, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and the birth centenary of Sethan is being celebrated today.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
The two words - work in all hands and water in all the lands - reflected his economic vision.
The country will celebrate his birth centenary as a 'Grib Kalyan Yojana'.
We will be able to free the country from poverty only when the society, the government and others will have to pay attention to how the beneficiaries of development will benefit.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on Vijayadashmi, I started the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The people of the country are always connected with me, which is always reflected in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
On the occasion of 2 years of Mann Ki Baat, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the kind of encouragement and energy you have given to this event.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani for not only campaigning but also making every effort to reach out to the audience in all languages.
I would also like to express my gratitude to all those who have written letters to Mann Ki Baat, have conveyed their misdeeds to the government, have prepared special programmes with these letters, have created a platform for the government employees to solve the problems in the programme.
This is the reason why Mann Ki Baat is not just a speech of fifteen to nineteen minutes but also a new medium of social change.
What could be the reason for anybody's greater satisfaction
This is the reason why I thank all those associated with it for making this institution a success.
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, Deepawali are going to start next week.
Navratri or Durgapuja Shakti must be worshipped for the unity of society.
It will be a festival to connect with each other.
That will be the means of real power and then we will be able to celebrate the victory together.
Let us worship Shakti, let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, August 29, is the birthday of Hawk's wizard Dhyanchand.
The day marks the National Sports Day celebrations across the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and at the same time remind you of his contribution.
He played an important role in winning the Gold Medal at Olympics in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We're all cricket-loving, Bradman's name.
He talked about meditation, 'He scores goals like runs'.
Dhyan Chand ji was a vibrant tool of athletes spirit and patriotism.
Once in a match in Kolkata, the opponent's player hits the head with a hockey stick.
It's only 10 minutes left when the match ends.
Dhyan Chand ji did three goals in those 10 minutes and said, I am bidding for injury.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time of Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestions on the MyGov portal or on the Narendra Modi App.
Shri Ajit Singh wrote in the Narendra Modi App, Please inform us about the participation of the AMAYAS in education and sports because they have made the nation proud by winning medals in the Reolympics.
Mr. Sachin has written to you, Your Excellency, Witness and Deepa will neglect the work of Mann Ki Baat.
One of them is from North India and one from South India, one from Eastern India and one from another from India.
It appears that the women of the country have taken up the responsibility of making India proud.
Teachers wrote at the MyGov portal. We could have done better in Olympics.
First of all, I would like to thank you for winning two medals in Rio.
But in the same way, I would like to draw your attention towards this thing. Was it good for us to participate in other competitions
Answer: No.
And no one can do this better than you.
Similarly, in the Narendra Modi App, Smt. Satyaprakash Mehra wrote, Mann Ki Baat, we need to focus on our additional educational programmes, especially on children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed the same feeling.
It's not a way of denying that we couldn't show results as expected.
In some cases, our sportspersons did not reach the sporting jurisdiction.
And we have just won two medals in the medals list.
But even if this is not true, if we closely monitor it then we will see that for the first time, the sportspersons of India have shown great skill.
See, our innovations in the shooting are 4th and he has lost his medals for a very short medal.
Deepa Karma was also a very good sportsperson in the gymnastics and won 4th position and lost a very few medals.
But how can we forget that she is the first Indian woman to qualify for Olympics and Olympics Finals in Gymnastics
Approximately the same happened in Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna Juti.
This time we showed good results to the athletics.
Lalitabawar qualified for sports at Track and Field, 32 years after the USA.
Boxing-Obikash Krishna Yadav reached the uarter Final, but did not win the medal.
Several sportspersons like Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atun Das and others have performed well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we want to do what we've done this time, we'll be disappointed again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
We will also closely discuss how sports is being practiced in the world.
We'll make a roadmap of how we can do better.
We have planned the outcome of 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I would also urge the state governments to form such committees and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would also urge the institutions associated with sports to do brainstorming independently.
State Governments should review themselves and send their suggestions.
We have to prepare our architects. And I believe that we will have 125 crore Indians, 65 per cent of the youth will have a very good impact in the field of sports.
My dear countrymen, Teachers Day on 5th September.
I spent some time with the students on Teachers Day for years and spent time like a student.
A lot of learning from these little boys.
I have the same teaching day on 5th September as Teachers Day.
But this time I have to go to the G-20summit so I want to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat today.
As far as mother and mother, the teacher's place.
Sometimes after the Rio Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopichand is being discussed repeatedly.
He's a sportsperson, but he's got evidence of how good he is.
Today, I see Gopichand as a better trainer than an athlete.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, his meditation, his dedication towards sports and the success of his disciples in his own way.
We always feel the role of teachers in the lives of all of us.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan jis birthday is celebrated as Teachers' Day.
Wherever he came in his life, he always tried to spend his day as a teacher.
Not only this, he always said, Good teacher is one who never loses the inner faculty.
Radhakrishnan ji had lived a wonderful life in his life as a teacher, as a teacher even as a President.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of my teachers because they were our ideals in our small villages.
Today, I can say with joy that one of my teachers, who is about ninety years old, still receives letters written by him in his own hand every month.
If you have photographs with your teachers, if there is a good incident with your teachers, if there is a message to your teachers then you must share it with everyone on the Narendra Modi App.
See, it is very valuable to see teachers in the country from the perspective of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be celebrated soon.
Lord Ganesh removes all obstacles and we all want our country, society, family, individuals and their lives uninterrupted.
Whenever we talk of Ganesh Utsav, Lokmanya Tilak's name comes to mind.
Lokmanya Tilak gave the Ganesh Festival an universal form.
He made this religious festival a celebration of national consciousness, a celebration of social reforms.
Through the Ganesh Utsav, all issues affecting social life should be discussed so that the society becomes renewed and renewed by the organisations organized at this time.
In addition, Lokmanya Tilak's Mantra - 'Swaraj Our Birth Right' is the central point of the discussion.
These days Ganesh festivals are celebrated not only in Maharashtra but also in every part of the country.
In particular, the youth started preparing for the festival with enthusiasm.
Some people are still trying to pursue the feelings of Lokmanya Tilak who started this festival.
Discussions, essay competitions, theme competitions were organised on various topics.
The Statue procession showcases all the aspects affecting our society.
Campaign for mass education was undertaken in Ganesh Utsav.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us the mantra of 'Swaraj Our Birth Right'.
But now we live in an independent India.
In this universal Ganesha Festival, we will now say, Su-raj is our right.
We will move forward on the path of Su-Raaj, Su-Raaj will be our main demand.
Can't we move ahead with this mantra
Come on, I urge you.
Our lives are impossible without festivals, but there is a need to change them according to the needs of the times.
This time many people have written to me specially about Ganesh Utsav and Durga Puja.
They are particularly concerned about the environment.
"Modi ji, Apneman ki Baat, explain to everyone that they should use Ganesh idols made by plaster of Parisdise and not using the Ganesh idols made of earthen pushkarini in the village.
Conservation of the environment, protection of rivers and pushkarnis and therefore protecting the smaller organisms from pollution to water is a tribute to the service of God.
Lord Ganesh-Vighanhari.
So we don't build such a statue that creates obstacles.
I don't know how you're gonna take my words, but I'm not saying this alone.
Environment friendly Ganesh Utsav - this is also a social service.
There's still time left for the Durga Puja.
Now we have to decide that if our old families who have made statues, if they make statues of Pushkarini or river then they will get the opportunity to earn.
And after the festive season, they will be refreshed and the environment will be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be awarded the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa served the poor people of India for her entire life.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians to be proud of Mother Teresa, the Prime Minister said.
On behalf of the Government of India and on behalf of the Government of India, a delegation of officials led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will participate in the event being organised from 4th September.
We can always learn from saints, sages, sages and great men.
I hope we learn new things, learn and do good.
Jan Shakti is regarded as a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with five State Governments, has made a successful effort to engage the common man in the Ganga Safai campaign for clean Ganga.
Village chiefs present in Allahabad have taken a pledge while witnessing the Mother Ganga. They will stop the practice of defecation in open in their villages, they will run a campaign to construct toilets, they will not allow Ganga to be constructed, they will join the Ganga Safai campaign in full swing.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I also express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers of the five states who have taken an important step by integrating the masses in the Ganga Safai campaign.
Girls from seven to ten years of age have done this work.
The emotional effect of this letter has been observed that on the day after receiving the letter, when the students came to school, some parents had written to the teachers of the school and they would give them toilets at home on a particular date.
A sixteen year old girl Mallamma, from Koppal district of Karnataka, is sitting in Satyagraha against her family.
When you can see that Malamma is satyagraha for defecation, he has constructed toilets within a week with an amount of Rs. 18,000.
A girl like Malamma, Jed Shakti and a village head like Mohammad Shafi are truly remarkable.
How can we build a road for solving problems - this is Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge to anyone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their objective.
The Government of India has decided to make a film on Swachh Bharat for 2-3 minutes and send it to the Government of India.
The details will be available on the website.
A competition will be held and the winners will be awarded on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
I also tell the TV channels that you make such a photo response.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relationship with our neighbours is deep, simple and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important event took place and Honble Vice President Pranab Mukherjee had inaugurated the Akashwani Maitri channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe somebody think the President's gonna make a radio channel
But it's not an ordinary radio channel, it's a big step.
We're in Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are also taking forward the same cultural traditions.
On the one hand, Akashvani Maitri and on the other hand, Kochi Betar will exchange programmes between them, while the Bengali people on both sides will enjoy Akashwani.
All India Radio has contributed in a big way to peoples connectivity.
The Honble President inaugurated the event.
I also want to thank Bangladesh for coming together.
I also convey my best wishes to the friends of All India Radio. They have been playing their role in foreign policy.
This kind of events gives new energy, new inspiration and this is the source of inspiration for the countrymen.
A few days ago, I received a letter that moved my mind.
A mother about sixty years old, a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
Unless he ever refused to disclose his name in the letter, I was very fond of saying his name to all of you.
In his letter he wrote, When you applied for gas subsidies, I gave up gas subsidies and then forgot it.
My countrymen, you know your concerns, I tried to send a letter to those who gave up their gas subsidy, and a representative of mine could present the letter.
I'm trying to write more than a million letters.
Here, fifty thousand rupees are not important, it is important that the emotions of this mother and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters like her are helping to shape the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about droughts, but in August this month we were constantly flooded.
Floods have occurred several times in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local administrative agencies, social institutions and citizens have been able to do so.
But in the floods, there are reports that need to be remembered.
Those who are trying to create disturbances in Kashmir by leading these little boys must sometimes reply to these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, this country is rich in diversity and diversity.
Till now, thank you very much
Today morning and evening I had the opportunity to spend some time with young friends from Delhi.
I believe that in the coming days, there will be an atmosphere of fervor and enthusiasm for every youngster to spread across the country.
We are all going to organize the largest sports event in the world within a few days.
Our ears will echo again and again.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India is organising a massive and beautiful race on Run for Rio, Plays and Lives, Plays and Prosperity.
Wherever I may be in the coming days, we will do something to encourage our players.
I will also be with you as a 125 crore countrymen, as a citizen, to encourage our warriors.
Let us all prize each and every player as much as possible in the coming days.
Today, when I was talking about Rio Olympics, Surj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Panjab Central University, had read a poem.
Perhaps there are many other poets who have written a lot of poems, maybe somebody writes poems, may recite them in every language, but I would like to enjoy the poem that Suraj ji has taught me.
A young man, Mr. Ankit, recalls the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
Last week, on the death anniversary of Abdul Kalam ji, the country and the world paid tributes.
Whenever Abdelkalam ji is named, then science, technology, missiles - the image of a powerful India in the future is visible to us.
And it is written that what is your government doing to make Abdul Kalam ji's dream meaningful
If we discover and discover old technologies, we will be out of the changing age of the world.
And that is why the government has taken a number of initiatives for the development of new generation science, technology, research and innovation.
Therefore, I say Let us aim to innovate.
And when I say Let us aim to innovate, then AI M means Atal I.
If we want to make the next generation entrepreneurs, we have to associate ourselves with this thing.
And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have a strong and advanced laboratory, we will build infrastructure for innovation, new entrepreneurship, and for achieving a definite goal.
As we need to build new labs, we need to upgrade the old laboratories.
We need to find technological solutions to these problems in everyday life.
We have called upon the youth of today to take up Atal Grand Challenges, if you see any problem in your eyes, find out technology, research and innovation for solving them.
The Government of India has encouraged innovators to come up with new technologies for solving our problems.
I'm glad people are very interested in this.
When we talk about Tinkering Labs, more than thirteen thousand schools applied for it and when we talked about Incubation Centres, more than four thousand academics and other institutions applied for it.
The State Government and the Union Government are working shoulder to shoulder to help the flood affected people.
Even though there is a problem for the rains, everybody's heart gets reflected in the rainy season, because our entire economic picture is at the centre of rain and farming.
Sometimes there is a disease that regrets our lifestyle.
However, if we are conscious, if we are cautious, if we are conscious of tackling diseases then it is easy to save ourselves.
Try to be careful about cleanliness, be careful, try to be safe.
Pay special attention to children and there is no misconception that dengue is only poor, but it's not okay.
Happy, prosperous areas are the first to dengue.
You must have noticed in the Doordarshan but sometimes we are indifferent to using it.
My dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention.
Life is so volatile, there is so much race in it, so it is never possible to think for yourself.
I think I'm sick and I'll get some antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating anti-biotics in such words can create serious problems.
Perhaps you rested for a while, but we should stop eating antibiotics consulted by doctors.
The microbes that cause tuberculosis and malaria are transforming themselves at a rapid pace so that the functionality of the medicine is destroyed.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic registration.
Antibiotics should be used as per the rules.
You'll pay attention to it.
When it comes to health, I want to add another thing to it.
Those pregnant mothers who live in our country, sometimes think about the loss of their lives.
In our country, nearly 3 crore women are pregnant every year, but some mothers die in childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that in the last one decade the maternal mortality rate of mothers has decreased but still the lives of many pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
Nobody knows when an unexpected crisis of pregnancy, anemia, pregnancy infection, high blood pressure and symptoms can be destroyed.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
According to this campaign, on the ninth of every month, all pregnant women will be provided free check-ups at Government Health Centres.
It is possible to save the lives of both mothers and children. And I would like to say in a special way that you cannot do free treatment to the poor mothers on the 9th of the month.
My doctor brothers and sisters, can't we engage the poor for 12 days in a year
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is deeply concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the battle in Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also spoke of the trees in the battlefield. We can guess the importance of planting trees in the battlefield.
Lord Krishna in Geetha says - 'Ashvatha: Sarva Vrikshanaang' means I am God among all the trees.
There are no plants that do not have medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, crosses the heaven like a plant.
Therefore, the mothers and the mothers who follow their well-being, plant good trees and grow up like a child.
Our classics - Gitahao, Sukracharya Niti or the discipline of Mahabharata - are some of the present generations who have shown this philosophy of classics in their own way.
A few days back, I recall the example of Golden Jubilee of Pune, which touched my heart.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the tree fellowship also performs the duties of a child and that golden duties not only to her parents but also to fulfil the needs of the society.
Farmer Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Jhunnar taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, had married his grandson gold in an exemplary manner.
Other temples can also start a tradition of sacrificing trees instead of prasad in this rainy season.
Currently, in order to build a house in India, for logistics, timber worth crores of rupees has to be imported from abroad.
If we plant trees that will be used to build furniture and houses on the banks of our food, then you can sell them after 15-20 years with government approval.
This can be a new source of income for you and to protect India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have carried out expeditions with the benefits of this monsoon season. Government of India has recently passed one CAMPA law. Under this scheme, more than 40 thousand crore rupees are being dedicated to the states for tree plantation.
Rajasthan has celebrated so many forest festivals in a desert state and has pledged to plant 25 lakh saplings.
Fifty-five lakh saplings in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who are acquainted with the soil of Rajasthan will be able to understand how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh also aims to increase greenery by 50 by 2029.
The central government is running the Green India Mission with the help of this scheme.
Gujarat also has a bright sustainability of forest festivals.
This year Gujarat has celebrated several schemes namely Ambassador, Ektawan, Shahid Van as Van Mahotsav and has carried out the mission of planting crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states, but all are praiseworthy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa.
This is my first journey and whenever there is a journey abroad, there is talk of diplomacy, industrialization, safety and security.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever it comes to South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever the words of non-violence, love, forgiveness etc. come to the ears of this world, their faces become visible to us.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoenix Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi known as Sarvodaya.
I was fortunate to travel by that train from Peter Marytsburg station on which Mahatma Gandhi had visited the train that had sown Janak Mohandas as Mahatma Gandhi. But what I want to say is that this time I had got the opportunity to meet those great personalities who have laid down their lives for equality and for equality.
Even after so many penances, there was no need for anything to be taken on their faces.
I could see the duties relating to Geetha as they were interpreted.
I'll remember that meeting for a long time.
There can be no greater mantra of equality and equality for any society or government.
It is the path that leads us to a bright future.
We want a good life, we want a better future for children. Everyone needs different needs.
Priority can be different but the path is one and that path is development, equality, equality and equality.
Let us take pride in those Indians who have made our lives live in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to artist Burma for telling me an incident.
Prime Minister, I am an artist from Bangalore, Burma.
A few days ago, I read in a newspaper paper that a lady, who had been cheated and cheated, lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
I have great sympathy for her family as a woman.
I want to know what you think about this fraudulent and fake e-mail.
"Some people have fallen into the limelight of money.
Through technology, there is a new way of quarrying which is spreading all over the world.
On the one hand, technology has played a major role in economic development and on the other hand, its misusers have also fallen into the ground.
You also make mistakes at some point of time because they write your letters so beautifully that it looks like they're real.
Your credit card, the Debit Card number, and your bank's account is evacuated through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, digital fraud.
We have to stay away from such fascinations, keep awake and share the message with friends and friends of the Alenzees and warn them of such lies.
Our Parliamentarians also took people from their respective places, showed them to me and talked about their difficulties.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
He painted a wonderful picture at the station.
Not only this, he also discovered the waste of plastic bottles or oil canes in the village and planted a vertical garden with soil filled trees.
In this way, the star station has been given a new shape.
If you ever visit Aligarh then you must visit the station.
There's a new feeling.
This is an example of how peoples participation can be transformed.
Thanks to all those who have been working in the country, especially to my colleagues from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals begins in our country when the rains come.
Festivals will be held at different locations in the coming days.
Festivals will be held at the places of worship in the temple and you will also be celebrating the festival at home and outside.
Rakhibandhan is an important festival for us.
Just like last year, you cant give the mothers and sisters of the country the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many people among us who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in independent India.
The uit India Movement was launched on 8th August, this year it will be 75 years and on 15th August it will be 70 years of Independence.
We enjoy freedom and feel proud to be an independent citizen. This is a moment to remember those who brought this freedom.
75 years of uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can inspire us, inspire us, and it can be a time for us to make a pledge to do something good for the country.
I hope that you too will do some good work in the spirit of patriotism.
And today the technology has become so easier that whatever thing you can easily reach me, I invite you all, let us recall the life of the freedom fighters.
Everybody plans a lot during the vacation.
And this is my summer, so I feel like tasting myself (we enjoy eating).
Sometimes I feel that if I get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it would be very good.
But this time the scorching heat has snatched all the fun on the four sides.
It is natural for the countrymen to worry about it.
And due to the continuous drought, the water accumulation area is also declining.
Therefore, there is a lot of sensitivity towards water and there is a lot of effort to conserve water.
A few days ago, someone was telling me that the Hibde Bazar Gram Panchayat of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers under it had emphasized upon the need for water in the villages.
We have decided to discontinue cultivation of crops like sugarcane, banana etc.
It sounds as simple to hear, it's not that easy to do.
What a big pledge you made
If a factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the factories because the use of water is going on a lot then you all know the consequences.
It is true that I talked about the market in a small village, Hibde, but there are so many other villages.
I congratulate all the villagers for this kind of good work.
I am told that the Gorba Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to construct agricultural reservoirs with its own efforts.
They built about 27 agro-water reservoirs.
The groundwater level had increased and the water had risen to a great height.
I would like to say that they deserve more than railways.
It is the nature of the people that no matter how much danger the day might be, no good news might have caused the danger.
Ever since there has been a possibility of 110 rains instead of 106, it has been felt that there has been a big message of peace.
It is still too late for the rains to come, but the news of good rainfall has generated a new inspiration.
The farmers need soil and the crops are utilized.
Can't we take the soil from the village pond and pour it into the fields
It will also improve the fields and enhance its water conservation capacity.
Whether water can be stored in a cement bag, ever in a fertilizer bag by placing stones and soil filled with water
Water levels will rise, water will come to our wells.
So we need to store as much water as possible.
The rainwater, the water of the village will remain in the village and if we do something, it will be possible only if we do it together.
So today water crisis is very good and drought is going on but we have time for the next one and a half months.
Shri Kumar Krishna asked MyGov: Will Ganga Safai Abhiyan be possible during our lives
Several governments have been formed, several projects have been completed and a lot has been spent.
And that is why it is natural for millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to raise this question.
Ganga provides us roti and roti and Ganga gives us new energy to live.
As Ganga flows, it also provides a new impetus to the economy of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us Ganga but it required crores of bhagiraths to save it.
This will never be possible without the help of the people.
We have to be a change agent for its cleanliness and transparency.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Efforts are being made to fully cooperate with all the states along the banks of river Ganga.
Efforts are being made to link social and voluntary organizations with one another.
Various measures have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factories.
Everyday there is a lot of garbage in the Ganges through drains.
Trash skimmers at various places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna, etc. to clean up these wastes.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and work on waste cleaning regularly.
Earlier, I was told that wherever efforts were made, it was possible to clean the garbage from 3 to 11 tons per day.
So it's true that we're compelled to clean up a large amount of garbage.
In the coming days, we are planning to install a Trash Skimmer at some more places.
And the people along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will soon be able to understand the use of this scheme, an effective plan for controlling pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry has been prepared.
The evacuation of waste from the Pulp and Paper Industries Black Liquor factory has almost stopped completely.
All this proves that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has increased.
Financial assistance is also being provided to the people for the cleanliness of Ganga, which is going on in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, April 24-2019
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day Panchayati Raj was established in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as an important unit of our democracy.
On April 14, we observed the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and today on April 24th, we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day.
The most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He was inspired to do this important work to connect the villages with the constitution.
Towards this end, his birth anniversary was launched from 14th April to 24th April, 2019 on the occasion of Beepi Gramodya to Bharat Bharat Bharat Abhiyan.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mahu, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on April 14th, and to bow down to that holy place.
Today, on 24th January, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand where most tribal brothers and sisters are present.
I will once again interact with all the Panchayats of the country at 3 pm.
This campaign has been a massive awareness.
At the same time, so many such events have been going on in so many villages of India for ten days and this is rarely seen.
I congratulate all the state governments and the village heads for this.
You people have utilised this opportunity to strengthen democracy for the betterment and prosperity of the villages in a very fundamental and new way.
And that is why the emphasis that we all insist on village Uday will be as much as we can.
Shermila called Dharkur from Mumbai and expressed her thoughts.
Namaskar, Prime Minister
I'm from Mumbai to Shermila Dharkur.
You have questions about my school and college education.
For example, there has been a need to revise the education sector over the years.
Today, if every family has a single dream then it is the education of a child.
Come back home and car.
In a country like India, this idea is for children to study, this idea is for them to teach them a lot.
I would like to further enhance this feeling of good education to the children and also to be aware of it.
That is why I would urge all the parents and parents to discuss with the children about the school programme for a long time.
And if you think of something then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This surveillance will help reduce the shortcomings in our education sector.
And it must be possible for everyone's participation.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and they have tried their own way.
And it is also true that for a long time our focus has been on educational institutions, education system, schools and colleges, teachers and teachers, and so on.
We have done a great job in education.
Now we have to emphasize on quality education.
Good education through literacy campaign should be our main objective.
We needed to calculate infrastructure all these days.
Now we need to assess the achievements of education.
Till now, emphasis was laid on how many students have come to school.
Filled, filled and filled. This mantra was chanted all the time.
But now we have to focus on providing good and deserving education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
It's true that there's a long way to go.
However, if we decide about 125 crore Indians then we can also cross this path.
Shermila ji's point of view is, however, true that it is desirable to bring about a change in our thinking.
You must have noticed that in this budget some work has been done beyond traditional thinking.
Out of the budget, 10 Government Universities and 10 Private Universities have been asked to get rid of Government bonds and ask them to know the challenges faced by them to be the best universities.
Indias universities can compete with other universities in the world and also need to compete like this.
Along with this, education is as important as skilling.
That is why technology will play a major role in education.
Technologies of distance education will make our education system easier.
And I believe that in the near future we will understand the results.
Excellency Prime Minister, Namaskar
This is Meena Karnaval from Bijnor.
Today, the youth have an important role to play in teaching and sports.
They need to work collectively and have good leadership qualities to enable them to grow holistically.
I would like you to inspire more and more youngsters and I would like the government to encourage more and more NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guide.
You have sent me so many suggestions that before I talk to you, I would like to interact with NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides etc.
I have been organising a meeting on your requests repeatedly so that the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra were present.
When I asked them when they had met before, they told me that they had attended this meeting for the first time since independence.
This time I've shown them something like this.
I told them that why wouldn't our young friends take part in water conservation during this summer
I had a similar conversation with them.
I see it as an act of irritation between us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a level that there has been a lot of discussion in the last few elections. Which party will give a lot of gas cylinders
Economists also suggested reduction in gas subsidies.
Some committees also proposed to reduce gas subsidy.
It's everyone's experience.
I had said this thing but today I want to say that I feel proud of my countrymen.
One crore families voluntarily gave up gas subsidy.
And this one crore families aren't rich.
I can see that those who have left the subsidies, among them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers and families of middle class and lower middle class families.
However, it has been reported that more than 80 per cent of the 1 crore families who have left the gas subsidies have gone to the distributors and left the gas subsidies in writing.
My dear countrymen, this is not a very small thing.
If the government gives some tax rebates, the government is appreciating the government on TV and newspapers throughout the week.
In our country, SubCD is considered a right.
But one crore families have given up subsidies.
First of all, I salute hundreds of crores of families and congratulate them because they have forced political leaders to think in a new way.
The world's economists, who do this, present such a financial paradigm, which is beyond their concerns.
Sometimes I feel that we declare that there will not be any ticket examiner on this route of railways.
We can do a lot of such tests.
He said trusting the people of the country can bring about hopeful results.
Anyway, it's a personal opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create such an environment.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader, it has created an atmosphere of millions and millions of families.
All breaking news is bad news.
Isn't there anything good happening around us in this country of 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
He used to say that repeatedly.
A few days ago, on behalf of a newspaper, he wrote to me that on Monday they will not publish any disappointing news.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
Any eminent personality who speaks good words, chooses good words and presents them in a better way, shows more impact than the good news.
Good news inspires us to do good work.
That's right, if you focus on good, the place of bad will fall from you.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will go away, it will be, it will be
Perhaps you are aware that for this reason, a website has been opened by the government - Transforming India - a vibrant news is being published on the website.
This is not just a government but you can also send some good news to the public.
You can also join this.
Ravi ji, you gave a good suggestion but please don't be angry with me.
We will all strive together to work constructively, to talk constructively, to reach a constructive goal.
The Kumbh Congregation is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a centre of attraction for tourists.
Very few people in the world know that crores of people have come to the bank of the river for so long.
In a quiet mind, this fair is celebrated in a peaceful environment.
This incident, from an institutional point of view, from the point of view of event management, gives a big boost to the participation of the common man.
Over the last few days, I have seen some people uploading the pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Governments to organise a competition on these films.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He was saying that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness and cleanliness should not only be laid in this premise, but they also want to take the message of cleanliness from Kumbh.
I believe that this Kumbh Congregation is a religious and spiritual fair but we can also make it a social gathering.
We can also develop as a cultural area.
This can be an opportunity to take the villages to the villages with an honest resolve and an honest practice.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchayati Raj, I will certainly meet you all.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
For Mann Ki Baat, there is always a wait from me and from you.
I've seen a lot of letters, comments, phone calls, many of which I've got stories, suggestions, inspiration.
I think you're examining me.
In spite of this, once again I would like to share with you all the words of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I had discussed a book of Premchand ji's stories and we had decided that if anybody reads a book then he would share some of it with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I've seen a large number of people sharing information about a variety of books.
I am glad that people have discussed books on science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, trade, lifestyle etc.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But one thing I have to admit is that I don't have much time to read.
But I believe that we should take this experience of the past one month forward.
I would like this book to be an active platform for corner, readers and writers.
Friends, I believe that earlier I had touched this topic of Mann Ki Baat, Water Conservation but today I feel that this water conservation issue was like touching your heart before telling me.
I feel that recently this water has shaken the hearts of our countrymen.
Several effective efforts are being made in the country for water conservation.
People are sharing information on a variety of traditions.
Media has started innovative campaigns on water conservation.
This will not only prevent land degradation and crop failure but also provide water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that Meghalaya, the beautiful northeastern state of Meghalaya, the first state of the country, which is the water policy of its own.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs in these times.
We can utilize these fairs for water conservation.
People from all walks of life come to this fair.
We can also organize an exhibition on water conservation and dramatic delivery of water in a wonderful manner, besides providing water conservation facilities.
And that is why today I want to listen to a few children.
They are Nidhi Baiptu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharakar, Anant Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Forest Ganguly and Hrishik Ala-Manda.
Whatever I say about them, you will be proud of them, you will also get a boost.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world fears.
Looks like death is on the verge of death.
But these 10 children have not only defeated cancer-related diseases in their lives but have also illuminated Indias name all over the world with their reputation.
In the field of sports, we often see a sportsperson champion after winning a tournament or after winning a medal, but this is a rare experience where they have become champions before participating and that too in the war of life.
World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
Sports like shooting, dada, swimming, running, football, table tennis were organized.
Our country's 10 work champions have won medals in this tournament.
Some of them have won medals in many other events.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you must be proud of the achievements of India in far and wide space beyond the skies.
From Jodhpur to Sanjib Haripura, Kolkata to Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana to P.
Aurobindo Rao, among others, has written the Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed interest to discuss Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, 2019 is a very good year for India in terms of space research.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March and then mission 2.
In the run-up to the election, such a big and important news like A-Sat could not be discussed much at that time.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a 300-km satellite.
India is the fourth country in the world to succeed in this region.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has glorified how Chandrayaan-2 has moved from Sriharikota to space.
The successful launch of Chandrayaan 2 has made the country proud, powerful and happy.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special mission in many senses.
We should believe in our talent and power.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an entire Indian initiative.
This is an Indian in life.
This is a fully indigenous mission.
The way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-2 in record time, day and night to solve all the technological problems.
We have faced such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always remember that we have the ability to overcome this obstacle.
I firmly believe that this Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the ultimate truth that science is the path of development.
We are awaiting the month of September with great interest when two lander Vikrams and Rovers will land on the land of the Moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to invite my country's student friends, my young friends to a fascinating competition, that is, a competition and I want to invite the youth of the country in a quiz competition.
Asked about space and space, India's space mission, science and technology are the main topics of this questionnaire - what to do if one launches a rocket, what to do with a satellite or what we can do with this satellite or satellite.
I would urge my young friends to take part in this quiz competition and make it more entertaining and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those artisans but for that you will have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the maximum number.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed that our Mann Ki Baat has provided momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
All the efforts that are being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago has now set a new benchmark for cleanliness with the help of everyone.
It is true that we have not yet achieved a paradigm shift in the area of cleanliness, but the way the cleanliness drive from the 'Open Defecation Free' to 'Open Defecation Free' to 'Swachhta Abhiyan' has been the result of the willpower of 130 crore Indians.
But that's not what we're going to stop.
This movement has now moved from Swachhta to Beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news report from Shri Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left the US job to serve Bharat Mata.
A few days ago, he took the responsibility of making Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started beautification work with his team from Astakud, Lodi Garden.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi are decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he switched overbridge and school walls to slums, many more started coming forward and the work started moving.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street painting during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team also played a major role in this work.
There may not be any words in the colors and lines, but the rhythm that comes out of the pictures produced by them has a more meaningful effect than thousands of words.
We are also witnessing this beauty during Swachhta Abhiyan.
We need to make efforts to make wealth from waste to wealth in our lives.
That is, we have to move from garbage to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read an interesting comment on the MyGov portal.
The comment was from Bhai Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Sopian district of Jammu and Kashmir.
I am very happy to hear the Mann Ki Baat written by him.
I am glad that I play an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme Back to Village in Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June, 2019.
I think this event should be organized every three months.
With this, online monitoring of the event should be organised.
I think this is the first such event where the people had a direct conversation with the government.
After reading the message sent by brother Aslam ji to me, my interest in knowing about the Back to Village scheme increased so I had read in detail about it and then I felt that we should inform the entire country about it.
The people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the mainstream of development of the country.
They also came to know if the villagers are getting government services.
How can we raise their incomes
Some more things were added to the programme to make it more attractive.
Childrens Sports Competition was organized under Khelo India Scheme.
The event also saw distribution of sports equipment, power cards for MAREGA and certificates for STs and STs.
The Economic Literacy Camp was opened by Government Departments of Agriculture, Horticulture etc.
Thus, the event became a development festival.
It was a celebration of public participation, a celebration of public awakening.
The people of Kashmir were dedicated to this development festival.
Some officer was so impressed by the warm reception given by the villagers that they stayed in that village in less than two days.
It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for the participation of a large number of people in rural households and participants in planning for their own development.
This is a wonderful result of new zeal and new resolutions.
Peoples participation in such programmes and such programmes shows that our brothers and sisters in Kashmir are keen to govern governance and the power of progress is always more than the power of a bomber.
Those people who want to spread hatred and stop progress on the path of development will never succeed in their hate test, it is clear as the light of day.
My dear countrymen, in one of his poems, Gyanpeeth Awardees Shriman Dattatreya Ramachandra Vende describes the form of Shravanamasa.
As soon as we look around in this weather, it looks like the basins are covered with green sheets.
This is the time when Rakshabandhan is celebrated for the affection of brothers and sisters.
When it comes to the month of Shravan, you will be pleased to know that this time most of the pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of pilgrimage in 2015, more pilgrims participated in this journey in 28 days.
For the success of the Amarnath Yatra, I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who have returned after their journey have brought back warm memories of respect and hospitality to the people of that state.
These will help in the development of tourism in the future.
I have been told that in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months from the start of the four Dham Yatra this year.
For the first time after a major natural calamity in 2013, a record number of pilgrims reached there.
I appeal to all of you, you must visit all those parts of the country, the beauty of which looks nice to see in the rainy season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage, it seems that there cannot be a greater teacher than this.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and lively month of Shravan gives you new energy, new hopes and new zeal.
On the other hand, it is a time when there is heavy rains in different parts of the country.
When we watch TV, there's a flood in the rain on one side, water on the other, traffic jam.
You will have to go out with your family to see another picture of the rain where our farmers, birds are enjoying, waterfalls are flowing.
Freshness and happiness bring both together. My best wishes are that the rain brings you all with sustained happiness.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stop it seems to be a difficult task, but at the end it is a limit of time.
I'll be back after a month's wait.
I convey my best wishes to everyone in the Easter.
My young friends, you're all busy in the exams.
Some people may have finished their exams.
T-20 Cricket World Cup is one of the best tests in the world.
Even today, perhaps you are waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Today, India will be playing with Australia and I convey my best wishes to the players of both the parties.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been consistently declining and losing.
Now, in Christianity, our place is so low that we can't have the courage to talk.
Throughout this year, we can create a football-football environment.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our young generation, our school boys, their sweat.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of them go to their respective states for 5-7 days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
I have told you to upload photos from wherever you go.
We have to take this work forward.
Even if you do this thing in a similar way, please write something with it - not just photos.
And that is, A traveler without objectivation is a bird without wing.
If you're fond of seeing good things, you're gonna have to create your eyes.
And I'm lucky I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, and I was a young man like you.
Perhaps there is no such district of India where I did not get the opportunity to visit.
Tourism has a big role to play in life-building.
And now the youth of India is going to tourism with courage and is going to curiosity.
I believe this is a very good example.
Our younger generation is brave, they should strive to reach wherever they are.
I want to specially thank Cole India.
Then I'll stay away.
When we see the pictures of people there, we think what's the point of going there.
And it's a matter of fact that the coal is black, that's why people get away from the mine.
But that coal mine is also a tourist destination
I am glad that more than 10,000 people have visited the environment friendly mine tourism site in Sawan village near Nagpur.
This place gives us a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on vacation then you will be able to do some work on cleanliness.
Maybe it's not working scientifically, but it's happening.
Can you also not give importance to the cleanliness of the tourist destination as a tourist
My firm belief is that our young friends will definitely help in this thing.
Thus, tourism is expected to generate a lot of employment.
India is still far behind in tourism as compared to other countries of the world.
But if we have to strengthen our tourism then we can definitely attract the world.
This is how we can drag a large part of the world.
And it will provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youngsters of our country.
Be it the government, the organization, the society or the citizens, all of them have to work together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the vacations just come and go away.
You should also think about it.
Would you like to let your vacations and important years of your life go this way
You can imagine how many things I am talking about.
Can't you take a pledge to add any other qualities to your personality on this vacation
If you don't know how to swim on vacation, you can resolve to learn to swim on vacation.
If you don't know how to cycle, you can learn to cycle on vacation days.
During the vacations, do something for your personality development, your capabilities and your skills.
There is an opportunity to work even beyond the areas I have spoken about.
You will see how much your personality and your confidence will increase.
Friends will talk about it.
This time some suggestions have been made on the MyGov portal for Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I am delighted to do this and I have also been friendly with many birds on this occasion.
I request you to repeat this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this boy named Abhi Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me that he's doing this all year and many birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Varma, the great Hindi poet, loved the birds.
In his poem, he wrote: I will not let you go away, I will fill your stomach, I will fill your pots with sweet cold water.
Please come forward, let us imbibe this message of Mahadevi.
I congratulate Abhi, I also express my gratitude to you for reminding me of a very important point.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysuru has given us a very sensitive topic.
He said the milkman, the newspaper, the postman, came near our house.
Sometimes a person with utensils or a cloth seller goes that way.
Have we ever invited them to drink water in the summer days
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the young world of the city
If you download this app on your mobile phone, you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather.
The App covers a wide range of issues such as market conditions, pickery market conditions, better yields, appropriate medicines, etc.
And if you put any questions before them, they will answer and explain it to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for farmers before the start of farming.
Can't we dig those old places once again and keep them clean so that more water can be stored
You must have seen that five lakh lakes and lakes of farm land are being constructed.
Under the Manrega scheme, we have been encouraged to create wealth through water conservation.
How to save water in every village, how to preserve every drop of the coming rain, how to reside in the village water, how to create awareness campaigns.
Please join the government schemes in this regard so that a mass movement can be launched with everyone for the importance and conservation of water.
There are several such villages in the country, many progressive farmers, many aware citizens who are doing this work.
But we have to move forward.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing that a few days ago, the government of India organized a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how many modern technologies have been developed and how many changes have been brought about in agriculture.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now the farmers are saying that the use of chemical fertilizers has to be reduced.
I congratulate this kind of thing.
Excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our mother sick.
But if good spices are given in large quantities, what does it like to eat
Whatever be the best fertilizer, the use of these fertilizers will be harmful.
Everything needs to be used as per the requirement.
It reduces costs and saves money.
I hope that the work that is required for water conservation can be completed with full focus.
The more the water will be saved, the more it will benefit the farmers and the more it will save their lives.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is World Health Day.
This year World Health Day theme Beat Diabetes is World Health Day.
Diabetes is a disease that brings out all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, then a lot of sick guests enter their house and body.
According to statistics, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country in 2014.
Three percent of deaths are due to diabetes.
Diabetes two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary, parents, and children are probable.
And the reason for Type 2 is rudeness, ageing and overweight.
The world is worried about diabetes and therefore the theme of World Health Day is Diabetes on 7th.
We all know, the biggest cause of diabetes is our lifestyle.
Our hard work is getting reduced.
No smell of sweat.
It's not moving.
We're playing the game online.
Nothing's happening in offline.
If you are interested in Yoga, then practice Yoga.
Otherwise, you're going to have to run.
If every citizen of our country is healthy, then India will be healthy.
And now all the facilities are in the hands of the people.
You must think about it.
TB Day was observed on 24th March, 2019 across the world.
When I was a kid, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But when TB was the cause of death, we were scared.
But now we don't care about TB.
In comparison to the world, the number of TB patients in our country is very high.
If TB is to be freed, then proper treatment and comprehensive treatment is needed.
Leave the treatment in the middle, create new problems.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also suggest check-ups.
It means, it's a disease that needs an early examination.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 Microscopic Centres and more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Do the right treatment and continue the treatment until the disease is eliminated.
I urge you all to defeat TB or diabetes.
India has to eradicate these diseases.
But this is not just about government, doctors, medicines, unless you come forward.
And that is why today I urge the countrymen to come, defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important days are coming in the month of April, especially the birthday of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar on April 14th.
His 125th Birth Anniversary was celebrated across the country with Dhammadham.
Mahu of Panchteerth is his birthplace.
He was studying in London, Deepa in Nagpur.
I am fortunate that on April 14 this year, the birthplace of revered Babasaheb Ambedkar will be Mahu.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a responsible citizen of the country.
We can pay tribute to him as a responsible citizen of the country by following that path.
In different states, the festival is celebrated in different names.
Some people call it 'Nab Samvatsar' or 'Gudhi-Parva' or 'Varsha Prapda' or 'Ugadi'.
You know, I had told you last time that you will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat programme in about 20 languages on your mobile phones at any time.
You just have to make a missed call.
It has been only one month and I am happy that about 35 lakh people have benefitted from it.
You can also write the number 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
I'm glad to be associated with you.
I also want to be your partner in this regard.
I have as much thought as you are concerned about the examination of your children.
If we alter our thinking process of testing then perhaps we can remain stress free.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send me with your feelings and your suggestions through the Narendra Modi App.
In my Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to specially interact with parents, students and teachers.
I want to say something from what I've heard, what I've read, what I've been told.
I know the test is about to begin in a few days.
What percentage of the exams
I want you to set some goals for yourself.
Don't put pressure on someone else's expectations.
You must work hard, but a realistic and perfect goal (which can be achieved) should be set for yourself and try to reach this goal.
When I played cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
Just as time has passed, people's aspirations have increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I had thought that I would expect myself and set a target for myself.
And if I set my own goal and can achieve that goal then I can certainly do something good for the country.
And I've always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was always on balls and that is why it has gradually been achieved.
And I believe God will give you good results.
Good luck
Never fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to make your future.
You should set your goals yourself.
Why would I waste my time in competing with others
Why don't I try to break all my own records
Friends, don't consider the exam as a number game.
Life should always be guided by a great goal: one should walk with a dream and one should be determined.
Whether we're driven in the right direction, or if we're moving in the right direction, this test is a part of it.
And if there's some flaw in meeting the expectations somewhere, it won't be disappointed.
Build a spirit of hard work and hard work.
Thousands of people have written small words on my app through mobile phones.
Shreya Gupta said that a healthy mind lives in a healthy body.
Students, along with your studies, also pay attention to health so that you can test properly.
Anyway, 365 days our daily routine should be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specially asked him to sleep at the right time and make a revision at dawn.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that the examination centre with Admit Cards and other papers should be reached first.
Maybe I couldn't say that, because I'm a little depressed about sleeping.
And when I'm talking about sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for examination.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping to be tense-free for good testing.
Don't do that.
I believe you're not gonna do that.
There is a need to strengthen the foundations of discipline and success in life.
Discipline is the strong foundation of life.
The rude and chaotic one who works at noon, works at noon, feels like the work is done.
That's why you don't think anything is small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, sometimes I've seen the test takers are two.
One, they concentrate on what they read, what they learned, what was good.
Secondly, there are other candidates who don't know any questions, any kind of questions will come up, I can't solve it or not.
I have seen two types of test takers - whether the question paper will be difficult or it will be easy.
There is a lot of similarity in exams with chess games.
When you're playing, you don't know which rice you're gonna get, just as you don't know, you don't know.
So if you stay calm, eat properly, sleep enough, you'll see that your brain will be able to remember the correct answers to the right question.
Dont have high expectations - just look at this as a challenge. Can I remember what I have learnt all year long, can I answer these questions
So calm down, sleep well at night, don't be too self-sufficient, but don't be negative.
I've seen that your test is better than your fear of exams.
So, be confident and convey my best wishes to you.
Vishwanathan Anand has really spoken very importantly.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that the events in Arjun's life were the eyes of the birds.
Viswanathan enjoyed the joy of being a part of his vision and a reflection of his inner peace.
You do not talk to your friends - you will stay alone, you will be hearty, you will turn your pages of many books until the end of the moment - you will never be able to calm your mind.
Hence, smile and smile with your friends, you will see that your mind will calm down.
But if the water isn't quiet, nothing can be seen.
At that time, I feel that if I take a little rest then it will feel good. Therefore, I have prepared a system by myself.
Deep breathing.
I'm breathing three-five times deep.
Sometimes it takes 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind calms down, it becomes fit to understand something.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you.
Because most of the time we have seen that we keep doing this thing by examining it and I have written a few mistakes.
If the parents are educated at home, if their parents are educated then ask them to write what I have written in the entire account.
We're stuck in it.
Guys, don't do that.
The test time is over.
Talk to the family members about other things, remind them of some smile of the left day.
If you are going to visit your parents somewhere then remember that sight.
Spend at least half an hour without worrying about the exam.
In the present scenario, he is trying to reach out to the world about the importance of traditional minds.
Revered Murari Bapu has given some important suggestions for the students.
And whatever the situation is, accept it.
In my experience, we can be happy and happy by adjusting the situation.
If you sit in an experiment with joy without any stress then you will be successful.
And if you do not achieve success then you will not feel sad for failure.
We are grateful for the advice given by revered Murari Bapu to all of us.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But friends, if I say that if we start practicing Yoga from tomorrow morning then it will be an injustice to you.
However, those who exercise Yoga will not do it today due to their experiments.
If you want to practice yoga then do it.
If you don't have a yoga exercise before the examination, you should contact a person who knows about Yoga and who can do it within 2-4 minutes.
Why don't you hurry for this
Prepare your entire day schedule so that the traffic jams can be checked in time.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety in the mind.
And one thing, the guidance in the question papers seems to be a waste of time.
I have seen that sometimes after getting the question papers, we dont get to know it correctly, but if we read the guidelines properly, we can adapt and fix it.
It is important to understand questions.
Rao has stressed on patience and has given his advice to all the candidates in a very short span of time.
That's what I tell my young friends.
At the same time, there are several opportunities in our country.
What you need is insistence, dedication, and the power to stay.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for encouraging the children of the country, for their dedication, fortitude, for their hard work and dedication.
Stay here, guys. Stay there.
If you're engaged, you're afraid of fear.
The bright future is waiting for you to do well.
My App, Ruchika Doubs, shared her experience of exams.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electrical bubble, and we've read about him in our syllabus.
But today the light of that power bulb is enlightening the lives of the people. That is why the seeds of success lie in failures.
He had no legal education in Mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world today.
But that wasn't the beginning.
How many challenges have they faced and how many failures have been made.
Nowadays, not only students, entire families, schools and teachers are involved in this examination.
But the situation of students is not favourable without the collaboration of parents and teachers.
A team consisting of teachers, parents and even senior students will be formed, united and proceeding with conscience will become easier.
Shri Keshav Vaishno Devi, my app has written, he has complained that parents should not put too much pressure on students to get more numbers.
We need to encourage them to be ready.
We need to think that they are unconscious.
Vijay Jindal wrote, don't put your hopes on the children.
Get them as brave as you can.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure that our present lifestyle has changed far beyond our generations.
We want to move forward with science at the same speed.
Friends, I am talking about this thing because today is National Science Day.
Every year we celebrate the 8th of February as National Science Day.
In February 1928, Sir C.
Raman had announced his invention 'Ramon Effect'.
It's because of this discovery that he won the award.
This is the reason why it was celebrated as National Science Day on 8th February.
Asked, Mother of Science.
Scientific thoughts, attraction towards science create new ideas and on the other hand, no new ideas can be created without science and technology.
"I am C.
I salute Raman and request all of you to increase the interest in science.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and whenever success is achieved then it changes the viewpoint of the world.
Perhaps you didn't get a lot of news because of your busy scrutiny but I would like to remind the countrymen that you might have heard that there has been a very important invention in the field of science in the world.
Our scientists have identified gravitational waves with their capabilities.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will strive to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, we have taken a major decision in the last few days.
There are only two such systems in the world.
India is third.
I once again thank all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, this is the number one. You will hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow on the missed call.
You will also be able to hear in your mother tongue.
Missed Call Number 81908 81908, I repeat
Friends, Your exams are starting.
I'm gonna have to test tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my exam.
29 February - It's Lip Year.
Yes, you must have seen how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Tomorrow, my test will be conducted. Parshu will be your start.
If we all succeed, the whole country will succeed.
Thank you very much
This is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
We had christmas a few days ago, and now we are preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is a diverse country.
There is a lot of festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is associated with the festival.
Festival is a medium of employment for the poorest of the society.
I also convey my best wishes to the people of Christmas and best wishes for the New Year 2016 in English.
May 2016 bring happiness to all of you.
New joys, new hopes and new resolutions will take you to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities, humanitarian threats, the earth is free from everything.
You all know that I use technology in full swing and I can learn a lot from it.
Many went out to spend Christmas holidays.
In the tourism sector, all other facilitation facilities are being taken care of, but they have drawn a specific vision, where tourist visits and accommodations, we need to take special interest in keeping these tourist destinations clean.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the brighter India's image will be at the global stage.
I welcome the idea of Shri Sauleshvarkar and convey his message to the people of our country.
He did an incredible job, published in the newspaper.
So I thought I'd get it to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, had decided that if anyone from the village collects the equipment for toilet construction, he would make toilets for the unpaid.
Considering this as sacred, he has constructed 100 toilets till date in Bhojpura village.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear disappointing things about our country.
Our country is moving at a rapid pace as a result of the collective efforts of all.
125 crore Indians have come together and are taking the country forward.
We have been able to do all these things in the field of higher education, new technologies and livelihoods eternally, insuring citizens to banking opportunities, innovative reforms at international level and infrastructural development in new businesses.
The people of ordinary families who could not reach the doorsteps of the banks, we have made it easier for them to get loans through MUDRA Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted to Yoga and when all the countries of the world were united on the occasion of International Day of Yoga, then we believed that this is our country-Great India.
When this kind of emotions emerge in our minds then a surprising image emerges in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is being heard in every house.
Peoples participation is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach these villages and will showcase the hopes and aspirations of the people of the country.
Therefore, the biggest benefit will be that those government servants who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the villages.
Is it not necessary to reach out to the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women and everyone
There is no need to reach out to any government that has worked, no government has worked, no information that needs to be reached should not be deprived of what they can achieve.
They must inform them about their own rights.
We should strive to deliver the right and good messages of the common man in large numbers.
It's a kind of service.
I've made a small effort to do this as I am.
I can't do anything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
An ordinary person can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and connect with me.
You should also join this endeavour as you are.
I want to reach out to 125 crore Indians. This is not possible without your help.
Come, let us motivate the common man by bringing the good and deserving rights of the people in common language.
My dear young friends, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I am starting up India, Stand up India.
Since then, it has spread to every department of the government that whether India can become a start-up capital.
New ideas and new strategies are desirable for everyone because the world cannot progress without new innovation.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they need only opportunities.
We urge all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On January 16, I will meet you and discuss in detail. I will be waiting for your suggestions.
There are millions of people in this country like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda's ideals.
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 1960 to 12 January 2019.
The festival is scheduled to be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January this year.
Can you give me some suggestions about this youngster
My special request to the young friends is to send your suggestions directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know about your mind.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give you the right advice and information to my Government.
Friends, I look forward to your suggestions for the youth festival through the Narendra Modi App.
The visually impaired teacher of Ahmedabad and Gujarat, Dilip Chauhan, has celebrated the Accessible India Day at his school.
I received a very encouraging response from the students to help the physically challenged people in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dileep ji, thank you so much.
You're working on it yourself.
You are well aware of their problems and you have faced a lot of problems yourself.
Whenever there is an opportunity to interact with such people in the society, I have a lot of feelings.
We reflect our approach to their problems as per our thinking.
Some people are accidentally victims of limb failure.
Again, some people are born with physical disabilities.
Various words are used for identification of these people and a lot of thought is being taken about these words.
But it always seems that the use of such words is not appropriate for these people, it is not honorable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year the Government of India has launched the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present at the function, I was thinking about it.
At this time, I feel that if God has given some imperfection to the body or one or two organs dont work properly then we can call it handicapped and handicapped.
But sometimes when I meet them, I realize that there is some imperfection in our eyes but God has given him some extra power.
They are those people who have one or many organs that have divine power, which are not in the body of ordinary people like us.
I like this word very much.
My appeal to the countrymen, can we replace the word 'divyang' instead of the word 'disabled'
On that day, we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
We will strive to facilitate the accessibility of persons with disabilities by developing physical and virtual infrastructure.
We may need schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, railway station slopes or ramps, easy parking and lifts, braille books etc.
In our country, subsidies are provided to gas cylinders.
The government has brought some changes in this regard.
Through Jan Dhan Account, Aadhaar Card etc, direct subsidy to the beneficiary's bank accounts through the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme.
I am proud to inform the countrymen that this is the Guinness Book of World Records for successfully implementing the biggest direct benefit scheme.
This scheme, known as 'Pahal', has been successful.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPG subscribers have been benefitted through PAHAL scheme.
Nowadays, the MREGA scheme is ensuring livelihood of the rural people.
A number of complaints were received regarding the funds released under the scheme.
Now, in most places, this money is directly reaching the bank accounts of the workers.
There were several problems related to the scholarships of the students and complaints were received.
This system has also been started for them and it will be taken forward gradually.
40,000 crore directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under various schemes.
Approximately 35 to 40 projects have been covered under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, Republic Day.
It is a matter of happiness that this year marks the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of the Constitution.
It is a very good experience to have a two-day session of the Parliament to discuss the Constitution specifically.
The Constitution also emphasizes duties.
There is a lot of duties at the time of voting but why shouldn't it be a duties in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, why cannot we organise compositions, debates and poetry competitions in schools, colleges, villages, cities and social organizations on our Primary Duties
I have got a new feeling in my mind, before 26th January, you can send me a composition in your mother tongue or in your duties in English or Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thinking.
You can send it to my Mygov portal.
I am very keen to know about the duties of the youth of our country.
I want to make a small offer.
When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, we cannot take steps to clean and beautified the images of the great men established in our cities by our citizens and school students and maintain the cleanliness of the area close to the statue
I'm not talking about the government system.
We are as desperate to preserve the emotions and emotions that we are committed to establishing the image of these great men as citizens.
Can't we make it a normal habit for the society, for the country
On 26th January, let us all work towards cleanliness of all these statues that have been constructed in honour of the great men.
For this, the common man, the citizens must come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and employment will start with a new zeal.
Preparations for Christmas must have begun.
Festivals have a different significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates a new zeal.
But sometimes whenever there is a crisis during the festival then it becomes very painful.
The news of natural calamities is coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that have never been heard or thought before.
I convey my condolences and condolences to all these families during these calamities.
The State Government has supplemented the efforts of Rescue and Relief.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
Presently, a team of rescuers of the Government of India visited Tamil Nadu.
I believe that despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to grow at a rapid pace and will continue to play its role in taking the country forward.
When these dangers are happening around, the need to prevent them is also increasing.
Now his appearance has changed.
In every field, its capacity building has become an important necessity.
The government, the scholarly society, the people and even smaller organizations have to work for the Capacity Building in a scientific manner.
I am glad that this initiative has been launched in Delhi through a table-tok exercise and workshop on Excellence Programme.
You are not only cultivating biotechnology but also understanding the problems faced by the farmers.
It is our habit and generations have been working to burn crops like this.
First of all, there was no idea of the harm that could be caused by it. Everyone is doing it.
Secondly, there was no training on what other methods could be.
When the impact of these calamities began to fall on the city, the people used to move against it.
The sorrow that you have expressed is right.
First of all, our farmer brothers and sisters need to be trained in the right direction.
Burning the roots of the crops will save time, the hard work will be saved and the fields will be ready for the next crops but that is not correct.
Crop roots are precious.
It's an organic fertilizer.
We're burning rice and destroying it.
This is not the end, if these roots are crushed, they can also be cattle feed.
The upper layer of farmlands is being burnt to enhance the root level.
Our land is burnt to the surface, which our fertile land drives to death.
That's why we have to play a useful role.
Mix the roots of this crop in the ground and see that it will heal.
If this organic fertilizer is used in that land, it will double the profit.
Once I had the opportunity to interact with the columnists.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas, they used to spend five thousand rupees per hectare, ten or fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean the roots of bananas.
If there were no trackers to clean it, the roots would have been like that.
Some farmers then used to bury these roots in pieces of six or eight inches and bury them on the ground.
Because there is so much water at the root of the banana that if there are trees, trees and grasses, there is no need to give water for three months separately.
The water that is at the root of banana leaves keeps the crops alive.
The roots that used to be used for cleaning earlier, are now getting income from them.
Our farmer brothers and sisters are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on December 3rd, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Disabilities.
Organ Donation was discussed in the last Mann Ki Baat.
I also talked about the helpline of Noto for organ donation.
27th November, 2019 was celebrated as National Organ Donation Day.
Chitravinetri Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries from the society were present on the occasion.
Organ donation can save many precious lives.
It can bring immortality in a way.
Whenever a part of the body is transplanted from one body to the other, it takes a new life, it also brings a new life.
What could be a greater donation than this
A national level competition was organised through MyGov. in portal to create a slogan on the issue of Notor Logo, Donor Card and Donor Card.
People with physical and mental disabilities have unlimited courage and ability.
But if we change our vision and change our attitude towards them then they can become the inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying even when we're in small trouble.
That is why they are the source of inspiration for us.
I appreciate their commitment, their energy, their way of fighting with life and their indomitable efforts to transform their problems into strength.
I want to talk about Javed Ahm today.
The terrorists had to discover some parts of their kidneys, small intestines and stomachs.
There was a serious injury to the spine.
Javed Ahmed didn't give up.
The terrorist attack couldn't seize him.
Without any reason, an innocent person suffered in such a way that he faced a life-threatening crisis, yet without expressing any anger or anguish, Javed Ahmed fought these dangers with sensitivity.
This is his greatest mentality and he has dedicated his life to the service of society.
Not always in power, but for the past 20 years, he has been engaged in teaching children.
MA in Social Sciences and as a social worker and conscious citizen, an angel with disabilities is doing a silent revolution today.
Can people from every corner of India not get inspiration from Javed's life
On 3rd December, I will specially recall the life, penance and human service of Javed Ahmed.
I am talking about Javed in a timely manner but I know that in every corner of India is a source of inspiration that gives a new light to life and a new direction to it.
On 3rd December, it is a day to remember such inspiring people.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things that depend on the government.
There is a regular relationship between the government and the government with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the downtrodden, the oppressed, the deprived and the deprived.
We have a network of ASHA workers throughout the country.
They do a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of malaria outbreaks.
Yamuna Monising, an ASHA worker from this village has decided that no one in his village will be allowed to die of malaria.
Anyone in the village may have a small fever but they should reach the house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of the first aid he has been taught.
Emphasizing the use of pesticide mosquitoes in every household.
Just as your child needs to be asleep and taken care of, just like this, the hopeful youngsters have dedicated themselves to protecting the entire village from the mosquitoes and made the villages free from malaria diseases.
How many Yamuna Monitorings are there
There are millions of people around us.
We will try to see their respect.
They can become the strength of the country.
We are always with happiness and sorrow.
I respect all the aspirations through Yamuna Monitoring.
The first is on the subject of Swachh Bharat, the second is on the Adarsh Gram Parliament and the third is on health matters.
I request you to see these e-books.
Show not only yourself, but also others.
Perhaps you might feel like adding something to it.
Then you must send it to mygov portal.
There are so many things that we don't see, but there is a true strength for the society.
Accurate examples are our greatest strength.
I urge you to come and join us in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
World Warming, Climate Change is one of the most illuminated and thought-provoking aspects and is recognised as an index before every activity.
The world's temperature should not rise, it should be everyone's thoughts and responsibilities.
The first way to avoid rising temperatures is energy conservation.
I once said that on full moon night the light should be shut down and the light should be saved and the light should be bathed in the moon for hours.
You should feel the ray of that moon.
I had a chance to see a friend who sent me a link to such a scene.
Nurjahan, a woman from Kanpur, who does not seem to have had the opportunity to study on TV, has done something that nobody thought of.
He has been using solar energy to provide electricity to the poor.
He is fighting darkness and shining his name.
People take lathons in the evening, re-charging in the morning.
Approximately 3-4 rupees per day is spent but there is enough light in the house.
This Nurjahan recharged the lamps through this solar power throughout the day.
See, the big people of the world are doing a lot for climate change, but one of them seems to have inspired all of them.
In fact, the name of Uzbekistan is to illuminate the world.
That's how he's spreading light.
I would like to congratulate the Honble Prime Minister that he has started a scheme related to the Mudra Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is funded.
Well, the speed at which I want to move, the speed is still coming.
Most of the beneficiaries belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes who have worked hard to run their families with dignity.
Absolutely spoke of his own zeal.
I've got a lot of similar news.
Someone just told me there was someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs. 8 lakhs from the bank through the Mudra scheme.
And he started cleaning the pyramid.
I had said during my Swachhta Abhiyan that this campaign will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh did it by the Gentleman.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want the scheme to be more publicized.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businesses.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the real strength of the countrys economy.
That's what we want to focus on.
Well done, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had spoken of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our society.
Internal Vigilance is the Prize of Liberty i. e.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, this Internal Security River has to be maintained.
I want to make this 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' a plan and I also wanted to suggest it on the portal.
I was told that there were a lot of suggestions.
I am told that certificates will be given to those who participate in this event.
Big prizes have also been announced.
I believe your suggestions will be of immense use.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season begins.
It's a good time to wear food and various dresses.
Then I'll tell you to exercise.
At least one hour every family will work together to see what kind of awareness will be there and how fresh it will be.
Build a good habit in a good season.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
This is the twelfth edition of Mann Kaa Baat and it has been a year since then.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of speaking in Mann Ki Baat.
Democracy has immense glory.
I have a fundamental concern in my life and that is why I have unfaithful faith in peoples power.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have learnt, what I have experienced, however, I can say that the people's strength is much greater than that.
Our ancestors have spoken of public life, saying they are part of God.
I can say this thing from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have great power to think, it is a big truth because I have felt it.
I asked everybody for Mann Ki Baat, but perhaps I tried to see or understand two or four suggestions every time.
But millions of people are actively advising me.
It's a very powerful force.
And this is how Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing his vision of the society.
I once talked about selfy with daughter.
And so the whole world was surprised to hear it.
But the pictures of lakhs of selfy with daughters from all over the world have reached and daughters have become proud of it.
And when they took selfy and daughters, they not only glorified their daughters but also made a solemn pledge within themselves.
And when others are watching these selfies, each one of them feels that they too have to give up their apathy towards their daughters.
People from every corner of India have sent lakhs of such photographs.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even imagine that there is so much invaluable wealth in our country.
Even a little bit, we're buying khadi stuff.
Today, I can say with great happiness that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any government advertisement.
Crores of rupees were not spent on that.
It was a belief of the people's power, a feeling.
I had requested the financially-rich people to extradite the subsidy for gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, a retired teacher, standing in line with gas cylinder subsidies.
The middle class, lower-middle-middle class families of the society, who are inconvenient to give up their subsidies, have also given up their subsidy.
Isn't that a quiet revolution
The more the government works with people, the more it works for the betterment of society, the more it works for the betterment of society.
The people of my country are trying to contribute to the welfare of the country by focusing on every small thing.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had thought of taking a new initiative.
Whether it is Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumari from Kashmir, there is no place in India where people have not called.
It's my own pleasure.
People of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked them.
My whole government will work according to your advice.
They have given positive suggestions.
This is the reason why the people of the country are also moving ahead with a positive attitude and this is a great resource for the country.
Perhaps there was some serious complaint on one or two phones.
And there's one thing we've seen, a lot of calls from disabled persons, especially blind people.
One of the reasons for this could be that because they don't have the opportunity to watch TV, they must listen to the radio.
From this I understand how important the radio is for the blind.
I got a new direction from these phones and these phones are extremely important for making the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me one suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people from all over the country should accept it.
Definitely listen to what he is saying: My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that your suggestion will spread to every corner of India at the time of wind.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Armed Forces on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi.
I have spent time with the naval personnel, the naval personnel and the Air Force, the Air Force and the Navy to protect the water, land and air.
What wasn't there - the whole history has been depicted alive.
The glorious moments of the war, the indomitable courage and sacrifice of our army, we can realise this exhibition because we didn't get any photographs or videography.
Whether it is Haji Peer fighting or the fight in the north of the country, the fight of Chamunda or the scene of Haji Peer Pass Jai, whatever may be seen, it is an adventurous feeling and it is a matter of pride for our soldiers.
The exhibition will last a few more days.
I urge all of you around Delhi to visit this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the power of democracy, a young man has been giving orders to the Prime Minister, but that little boy has hurriedly forgot to tell his name.
We should make Swachhata a habit and take appropriate steps for it.
I also have to listen to a lot of things that Modi ji used to talk about cleanliness in a big way but what was happening at the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament and on the other hand, the children of the country are talking about cleanliness and what can be a greater good fortune than this
The movement towards cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred towards garbage, the awareness about cleanliness, the government will also compel this government to work towards a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Bodies namely Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, Pur Nigams, Metropolitan Municipal Corporations or States or Centre-Every entity will have to work in this regard.
We have to take this movement forward in difficulty and we will move ahead in the right direction to achieve the dream of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi had once said that if I had to like one between freedom and cleanliness then I would like cleanliness first, after independence.
For Gandhiji, cleanliness was more important than independence.
Come, let us follow Mahatma Gandhi and let us take some steps to fulfil his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the life philosophy of the great men is a source of inspiration for us.
Sometimes it is historically linked to the name of some great soul.
In the coming days, we will remember these great men, visit each and every household and try to learn something from it.
I would particularly like to mention on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of the revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had also said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different types of fabrics and many other items but Khadi should have a special place.
And that is why in this Deepawali, we will definitely give place to our house, we will wear khadi clothes.
And look, last time the sale of Khadi clothes doubled.
How much poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot afford to spend millions of rupees through advertisements has been done with your small help.
And that is why I once again request you for this thing.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with joy.
My heartfelt desire, you are also a part of this happiness.
I visited Kolkata in May and some of the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose came here to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose arranged everything.
I had the opportunity to spend some time with the family members of Subhas Babu.
You can imagine how pleasant this thing is for me.
Perhaps they are all coming together for the first time in the Prime Minister's residence.
But it is a matter of great pleasure for me that the opportunity to host such a hospitality at the Prime Ministers residence has never come in the month of October.
There are more than 50 members of the family of Subhas Babu, who live in different countries.
He sent me a message from the Vargvi Kande, and when I heard his voice, I thought he was going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to educate the youth to register for voter registration, thereby enhancing the participation of the youth in the coming days and making significant contributions to the formation and governance of the government in the future.
Thank you, Vargavi said on the electoral roll and on the issue of voting.
Every voter is fortunate in democracy and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission used to conduct elections only but in the last few years it has undergone a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an election director but also a supporter, a voter-friendly person. And all their concepts and schemes are central to the electorate.
But only the Election Commission will work, it will not work.
I hope that the youngsters of the country will surely register their names in the electoral rolls and they will definitely vote.
I speak frankly on the day of election, Voting, then Drinking Water.
It's a sacred duty, everybody should do it.
Last Parshu I visited Kashi.
I have met a lot of people, I have had a lot of programmes, many have met but I want to tell you about two boys.
But his interest in physics at such a young age has surprised me.
I think he studied a lot, used internet surfing, and was familiar with new sciences.
He talked about how to get rid of rail accidents, what kind of technology is needed, how to reduce energy costs, how to experience robots etc.
A small sandman called Sonampatel met.
Sonam is nine years old.
I was surprised that the whole Geetha was the voice of the girl, but the most important thing is, when I asked her, she was slogging in English, explaining the shloka, analyzing and listening in Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since the age of five.
I asked him about his studies, did he just read Geetha or do anything else
Gentlemen said, "No Sonamadi once started numerically and ended all the lessons by evening, and if history is read, it's a mouth in the evening."
They're surprised about the girl. She's the only one in the family.
I'm really amazed.
Sometimes children are fond of being celebrity, Sonam has nothing to do with it.
I think God has given it a special strength.
Sandeep ji, what else would you do to me
Once a month, I have to make a lot of efforts to do this.
Sometimes our friends in the All India Radio have to wait for me for half an hour, an hour and a half.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how well Subhas Babu used the radio
He started broadcasting his own radio from Germany and through radio he used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly bulletin.
The radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Books, etc.
I would like to listen to you, think for you, consider your suggestions, and that is why my thought process opens to you, which reaches you through the All India Radio.
I say, but it's just yours, and that's my satisfaction.
Once again I got the opportunity to be amongst you on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
People from far-flung Southern India are celebrating Onam Festival and yesterday the entire country celebrated the Holy Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has started several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am glad that in such a short span of time many people have come under these schemes.
I had made a small request that our sisters should be given a protective scheme at Rakshabandhan.
I have received a lot of information, which shows that eleven crore families have been linked to this scheme since its inception.
I am also informed that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
Today, when I was talking to you, a year ago the Jan Dhan Yojana was launched.
There were a lot of questions that didn't happen in sixty years, would it happen in such a short time
This has also helped the youth of the country.
31,000 Financial Literacy Camps have been opened in a year to bring together the banking sector, the economy and the under-privileged.
The belief that even the poor can get money from the bank has been enhanced.
I once again express my gratitude to all those associated with it and I urge the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened their bank accounts.
This bank is yours, you don't leave it anymore.
I have delivered it to you. It's your responsibility to hold it.
We have to keep bank accounts running.
I have full faith, you will keep it.
A few days ago, the violence in Gujarat had devastated the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the kingdom of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the entire country is saddened.
But in a short span of time, the people of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation from getting uneven and Gujarat has taken the path of peace again.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood is the right path and we have to walk shoulder to shoulder for development.
Prosperity is the solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to scholars of Sufi Dhara.
I am telling the truth that this experience of listening to their noble words has brought a song to my ears.
The words and expressions of those scholars, the tradition of peaceful generosity in the Sufi stream, have reached me like a musical lion.
I liked it so much.
Perhaps this true nature of Islam is the most important thing to be delivered to the world of copper.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that the benefits of the entire mankind and Islam are benefited.
I would like to say to others that we are different communities but we need to understand the Sufi approach.
I am fortunate to have another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
The scholars of Buddhism from many countries of the world are coming to India in Buddhism. They will discuss various issues related to humanity around the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there.
The first Prime Minister of India visited Pandit Nehru Buddha Gaya.
It is a moment of joy for me to meet all these wizards of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you people in particular.
I have already spoken about this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
You have heard it in the Parliament, in the General Assembly or in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government is open to the debate regarding Land Acquisition Act.
I have been told several times that I am willing to take any suggestion for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that a lot of misunderstanding has been spread and the farmers are being scared of it.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers should never misunderstand and fear should never be obtained.
I don't want anyone to misunderstand or scare farmers.
Every demand of the country is essential to me, but the demand of the farmers is the most important.
I've decided, let this expire.
That is, the position before my government was formed has come back.
But that was incomplete.
There were 13 such issues which were supposed to be completed in a year and that is why we brought them in the Ordinance.
Our mantra is for the welfare of the poor and the farmers in the villages.
Therefore, on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be created.
We are trying to make this decision faster.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason for confusion. There is no reason to doubt.
If someone tries to scare you, don't be afraid.
I have one more thing to say.
Two days ago, the war of 1990 was completed in fifty years.
Whenever it comes to the battle of 1980, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan'.
It is also natural to remember the sacrifices made by the martyrs for the glory and honour of the Tricoloured National Flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the 65th India victory and salute the brave martyrs.
Such historical events continue to inspire us.
I am glad that India is doing well in various fields of science.
Our scientists are doing a really good job.
I have seen a new dream in the eyes of young scientists talking with enthusiasm.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After discussions with scientists, I felt that there are several opportunities and possibilities in this field.
I am glad that in just fifteen days, the government has started working on this thing in a very short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and very soon it is expected that interviews will be made available for small jobs.
Recently, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
In order to reduce health, especially maternal and infant mortality, 24 countries of the world have jointly agreed to the Call to Action Plan of India.
This is the first time that any other country outside the United States of America has taken up this scheme.
It is true that even today nearly fifty thousand mothers and about one lakh children die in childbirth or after childbirth.
It's very worrying and scared.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India's appreciation at the international level has also started, yet this number is not less.
Just as we have been freed from polio, mothers and children have also been freed from tetanus.
The entire world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and infants.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting a lot of news these days.
It's true that dengue is very dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It is directly related to the Swachh Bharat, which I have spoken about.
We watch advertising on dengue, newspaper advertisements are printed, but we don't pay any attention.
There are rules for cleaning the household little things, purifying water.
People's education has started on a massive scale, but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes I feel that we are living in a very clean house, a very good arrangement but I dont think that I invite Dengue to the water accumulated in my house.
I urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is precious.
It's not right that the disgusting attitude towards the dirty water around will be the cause of death.
There are around 514 centres across the country which have free Dengue testing.
Examining timely death is very important.
Your cooperation is indeed a great pleasure in this regard.
Cleanliness has to be given utmost importance.
Now there will be many festivals across the country from Rakhibandhan to Deepavali.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to share a good news.
I have often said that now there is no privilege of giving life to our country but it has been the privilege of saving our country.
Two youngsters from my country, two brothers from Nasik in Maharashtra, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have made India proud.
There is a cycle race in America, Race Axis America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am glad that these two brothers have achieved the goal of 'Team India Vision for Tribals' by working for the welfare of the tribals.
See how everyone is trying to take the country forward at a personal level.
When I heard these things, my heart swells with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to the new generation by concentrating on the old ideas.
Old generations think that the new generation does not know anything and this concept has been going on for centuries.
I have interacted with a number of youngsters who have spent their lives on Sunday on Cycle.
Some people say that I celebrate Cycle Day one day in a week.
It is also very useful for my health and environmental protection.
And I like to think about the young man I am.
Now cycles are being run in many cities of our country and there are many people who encourage cycling.
It is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two youths of my country have unveiled the national flag in America, I am delighted to mention the way the thinking of the youth of India is going on.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The building of Babasaheb Ambedkar's memorial in the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai has been stuck for a long time.
We have bought the house of 10 King Henry Road in London where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar used to live.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar there.
This place of London will be an inspiration for the Indians who have travelled around the world.
I appreciate the efforts of the Government of Maharashtra in paying respect to Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud to congratulate him.
It's a good start this year.
This will help our farmer brothers and sisters to plant Kharif crops.
And I'm glad to see a happy news.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
We want pulses for the poor, we want some oil for the food.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that the amount of pulses that has been increased by nearly 50 and that of oilseeds has increased by about 33.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in our history.
The closer the farmers' land to the land, the more the soldiers of our country.
The Kargil war was not just on the borders of the country but also on the borders of every city and every village of India.
This war was fought by those mothers and sisters who were fighting against the enemies in the army boys and brothers in Kargil.
It is because of their sacrifices that India is able to speak at length across the world today.
And I am glad that after one year I have seen the MyGov portal.
Why not save people with disabilities while booking train tickets through RCTC Website
Now it's very small, but the government never thought about it or didn't consider it.
But the government has taken into consideration this opinion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee with utmost importance and today this system has been started for our disabled brothers and sisters.
The logo that is being developed today, the tag lines are being constructed, the plans are being prepared, the policies are being formulated - MyGov portal has positive views on all these things.
There is a feeling of a new clean air in the governance system.
A new consciousness is feeling.
Nowadays, there are several suggestions on mygov portal about what I should say on 15th August.
Raghavchari has sent a lot of suggestions from Chennai.
You can send mygov portal, write letters in All India Radio, write letters in PMO.
Look, I'm a good thing in Mani that on August 15th, I'll get advice from the public for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I witnessed an accident in Delhi and a scooter driver has been roaming around for 10 minutes after the accident.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at statistics, your mind gets upset.
An accident occurred in our country every minute.
For accidents, one dies every four minutes for road accidents.
And most importantly, one-third of these dead people, a young man between the ages of 15 and 25, can destroy the entire family.
They will do whatever the administration should do, but I would urge my parents that your son should be clever or four-wheeler, all the efforts should be made by the family in order to be cautious.
Sometimes I have seen how touching it is that it is written on Auto Rickshaw, Papa uick Gruh Aananah (Be back home soon).
And that is why I have said that the government has taken several new initiatives in this direction - be it education for road safety or be it road-making technologies or be it introduction of administrative systems or be it providing emergency treatment to the injured persons after the accident, we have brought the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
I am keen to take some important steps to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan in the coming days.
I have also undertaken one more project which will cover all the national highways from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondiya.
For the first 50 hours after the accident, I would like to see if the injured person has money, who will pay, who will not pay, how the injured person gets good health care and how he gets first aid.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033 to report the accident across the country, an ambulance has been arranged but all this is the next step after the accident.
Sometimes I say that the employees are job seekers.
I would like to tell you something that has happened in the last few days, which I liked.
Vijay Biswaal showcased how one can connect ones own interest, ones own industry and ones own capabilities with ones own work.
In the coming days, there will be a lot of discussion and exchange of views on the picture of Vijay Bishwale.
I also remember one more thing - the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started a work in the entire district that touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken up the responsibility of providing toilets to their sisters during the Raksha Bandhan Festival so that no mother and sister in the entire district should go out to defecate in the open.
I came to know about something that I would like to share with you.
There is a small village named Kesla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been engaged in toilet construction for the last few months.
Now no one in this village has to do open defecation.
After the completion of the construction of toilets, the people of the entire village celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an example of how the values of the society are changing, how the mindset of the people is changing and how the country's citizens are taking the country forward.
About North-Eastern India, Bhavesh Deka of Guwahati has written to me that the people of North-Eastern India are very active in their work.
They keep writing a lot - this is very good.
Today, I am glad to tell them that there is a separate Ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate Ministry named Development of North East Region (DoNER) was created.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department has taken an important decision that the development of North-Eastern India cannot be achieved by sitting in Delhi.
Together they decided that a team of officials from the Government of India will visit the states of North Eastern India like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim etc. and will be camping for seven days.
Efforts to move from Delhi to the East, which I call Act East Policy, should be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are happy and proud of the success of the MARS Mission.
Over the last few days, we have successfully launched five satellites of the PSLV C28 United Kingdom of India.
All these news comes for a few moments and goes away again.
We don't normally remember these things.
But sometimes I imagine that today when we talk to the younger generation and want to know what they want to be in the future, we get out of 100 students who say I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Exploration Campaign (NIC) to discover new talents.
Now you have to go to another village if you want to charge your mobile.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll finish it.
I'm starting this, and I'm going to finish it.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
Several festivals are also celebrated.
My best wishes to you all.
You must send your suggestion for August 15th.
Your views will be of great help to me.
Thank you very much
When I told you, I didn't think I'd find such a remarkable response.
Millions of people posted photos in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
One after another, I saw a photo of how many diversities India has - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers and seas - what
I believe that the government of India has not been able to think about tourism.
And I liked some pictures so much that I retweeted myself.
I don't think that if we don't post the photo of the Belum cave in Andhra Pradesh, we might not have known that such a place is hidden in our country.
But the scene we saw on 21st June is very strange and I believe that wherever the sunlight reached, there was no country where the sun was not welcomed by Yoga.
I can assert that the sun never sets in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the people of the world have honoured and made Yoga self-reliant.
I am also very happy.
The Sin River and the Eiffel Tower are a symbol of pride for the French people, who liked the place for Yoga and showed equal respect to Yoga.
People performed Yoga at Times Square in New York.
As Australia speaks of Australia, the picture of the Opera House flutters in front of the eyes.
Australians practiced Yoga at the Opera House, showed Yoga the same respect as the Opera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Duomo Cathedral of Milan, Yoga has made us proud everywhere.
On 21st June, when Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, had practiced Yoga at the United Nations Headquarters, I was delighted.
Similarly, members of United Nations Peacekeeping Forces performed beautiful Yoga.
In Siachen in India, our troops have joined the white ice sheet, where our naval personnel were in the sea, they participated in the Yoga Programme.
Yoga has placed itself in the Ginnesbook of World Records in Delhi.
It seemed that from every corner of the world a new question, a new joy, a new zeal and a new spirit is coming up.
A few days ago when I had telecast a photo to practice Yoga for a young child from a family in Vietnam, that photo was so beautiful that he was appreciated all over the world.
Women, children, villages, cities and developing countries have joined us in Yoga.
Yoga truly binds the whole world in one stream.
I dont know how scholars and scholars will look at this event but I feel that every Indian can feel proud that the whole world is keen to know India.
Everyone's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know the values, traditions and heritage of India.
It is the responsibility of all of us to keep this legacy intact.
If we are proud of our heritage, we can do this.
Sometimes we are so familiar with something that we dont see in them, like our family values, we dont know that our family values are important to the people of the world.
Then why shouldn't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be surprised. My constant belief will be surprised. There are many best things that our ancestors have given us.
With the success, joy and satisfaction of the International Day of Yoga, we have taken a new responsibility.
It is our responsibility to make the world a good yoga teacher.
I believe that you can create a database about where to learn Yoga and where to find Yoga.
The government has been working on these things in a different way and we have seen the results of the governments efforts, their vision and their vision.
When there was despair around us, like a year ago, we used to hear that nothing will happen - nothing will happen.
Ayush is a department of the government.
No one paid any attention to this
However, on the occasion of Yoga Day, this small corner of the country has led and has organized such a grand event across the world smoothly.
If the target is fixed, the small scale sector can do good work.
Just a few days ago, the world saw how our people protected people from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians have moved forward to help Nepal.
If the government becomes active, the employees of all the banks have come forward to open Jan Dhan Accounts in the bank and within a short span of time crores of Indians are connected with banks.
On 15th August, I had requested all the schools in the Red Fort to construct toilets and I had said that we will have to complete this work by 15th August next year.
He said that the work that was not completed in sixty years, was a big bravery.
It means that the government, the common man, the government employees, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, I had started three public safety schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been linked to the Jan Suraksha Yojana in some way or the other, although we have to take this scheme forward.
Rakhibandhan's festival is coming in August.
We cannot create a strong Jan Andolan before this festival and we cannot provide the benefits of Jan Suraksha Yojana to the mothers and sisters of our country.
On the occasion of Rakhibandhan, it can be a very big gift for sister on behalf of Bhai.
When I come to the Mann Ki Baat programme, many people send me suggestions.
Many people have advised me to talk about rain.
From Nagpur to Yogesh Dandekar, from Mysore to Harshavardhan Mahasai, Praveen Nadkarni Mahasai, Divyanthu Gupta Mahasai - everyone told me to talk about rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This weather gives a lot of fun to the mind.
People of any age want to enjoy rain water for the first time.
You must be enjoying warm tea with hot pakora, fried rice and corn during this rainy season.
As the rays of the sun give us energy, rain gives us strength.
Drinking water is very valuable.
As citizens, we have to develop a habit of saving some water as a people of the society.
We should make a solemn pledge that the water of the village will remain in the village and the water of the city will be in the city.
Ren water harvesting has been happening for centuries.
Check dams, watershed development, small ponds, small reservoirs of the fields. Whatever be the case, we have to save some water.
This is Porbandar on the seashore, so rainwater was collected for sweet water and kept at home.
Even at that time there was so much effort to conserve rain water.
We can do the same.
And I would like to give you a suggestion that comes from my direct and successful experience.
It's a complete rural technician.
When you plant trees then you can plant an old earthen mud near the tree and fill it with water.
Filling water once or twice a month.
This tree will grow very soon and will be very strong.
I would like to tell the farmers that you should plant trees without turning around your fields.
And we are also aware of the fact that during the rainy season the disease spreads more through water.
The bacteria become active to increase the moisture in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is extremely important at this time.
You should drink pure water at this time.
It's true that we'll be as cautious as we are, the disease will be as far away.
I want water and rain but I want to save you from diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently launched three new projects, especially for the citizens.
There are at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want electricity, drinking water, toilets and schools to study the children.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022 then we want to give every Indian a home.
I have been connected with all of you through social media.
I am getting new ideas, suggestions and suggestions from you people and I am getting a lot of suggestions about the government's work.
But when this government scheme becomes its own scheme of individuals, society or village then how much power is there
Shri Sunil Jaglan Mahasay, Chief of Panchayats from Bibipur village in Haryana, has made a very funny attempt on the occasion.
And it creates an environment where each father takes a selfie with his daughter and thinks of posting it on social media.
In Haryana, the number of sands is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where such a situation is very worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana is.
And that is why I urge you all to join your daughters in Selfie with Daughter.
In order to strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write a tagline and write a beautiful tagline which can be written in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will re-tweet your selfie with your daughter.
In a way, we can convert Beti Bachao Beti Padhao into a mass movement.
Make our country grow.
I am telling you from my experience that you take this effort forward.
Make this part of your life.
One more thing - Incredible India - wherever you go, you must send your pictures.
Our country and the world will know how many diversities our country has.
I believe that the pictures that you people are sending are very rare in the pictures related to handicrafts.
You can also post the pictures of the handicrafts of your area in Incredible India.
Many things are manufactured in your city. The poor people also manufacture things.
And we have a simple means of accessing.
My dear countrymen, that's all.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be with you all again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to announce a big government scheme but not that.
I'm working day and night.
I am very happy to have a slight conversation with you people through this programme.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You just imagine the time between this.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that words are mine, sounds are mine, sounds are mine, but the voices are yours, the words are yours and the power is yours.
But this Sunday has made me wait a lot.
Well, there's finally a chance.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat means a small mind, which can change in the life of the society, its sustainability can give birth to a new inspiration, so that the spirit of a New India can be sacrificed and the spirit of a New India can move forward.
My glorious interaction with you people was a part of this spiritual journey.
Several people asked me why I went to Kedarnath in such a busy schedule.
You have the right and I can understand your curiosity.
I think I've ever told you about the situation of my time.
But today I feel that if I talk about these things then the way of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Poll busyness, losing guess and polling still remains when I left.
Most of the people found it politically.
But it was an opportunity for me to meet myself.
You know, I went to meet me.
I don't know when to say I don't know, but I'll tell you because you have the right to me.
The way people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, the positive energy that you have strived for, I always feel about you.
Sometimes some of your words sharpen my thinking.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people of the country and society, and the solutions to them.
I have noticed that there is a description of the problem in the letter but there is also a feature that includes some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations being given directly or indirectly.
If anybody speaks of cleanliness, he expresses his grief over garbage and welcomes this effort towards cleanliness.
Whenever someone talks about the environment, he feels the pain of pollution and he also talks about his own efforts.
He also spoke of the ways and means being adopted, and the imaginations he had imagined in his mind, to prevent environmental pollution.
It means a glimpse of how the solution of the problem can be solved with the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror to the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of spiritual strength, capability and talent among the people of the country.
It's only necessary to guide that power and talent in the right direction, give it a chance to utilize it.
Mann Ki Baat Ao says that the strength and activity of 130 crore Indians has to be added to the progress of the country.
I would like to say another thing that in Mann Ki Baat, I have received a lot of letters, a lot of phone calls, a lot of messages, but there are very few complaints but I dont think that this has happened once in the last five years.
You can imagine that someone is writing to the Prime Minister of the country but doesn't want anything for himself
This is a testimony to the high ideals of millions of people across the country.
Today my mind is full of happiness.
And that is why I had announced in the last Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will return to you again.
Let us imbibe the sustainability of Mann Ki Baat.
The movement against him was not confined to political circles, political leaders and prisons only when the Emergency came into force.
I don't feel hungry when we eat on time tonight.
Just likewise, the importance of the right to democracy in everyday life is felt only when that right is robbed.
And this is not because the Constitution of India has taken some steps to promote democracy.
Constitution and laws are needed to ensure smooth functioning of the society.
And that is why the country has dedicated an electorate not only for itself but also for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the largest election process has been completed in our country, where the richest of the poor and the poor have joined the campaign to decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we cannot understand its importance
Over 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, Sixty One Crore
The number may be simple, but if we look at the entire world then I would say that without one China, more people have voted in India than any country in the world.
The number of electors in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is nearly double the total population of the United States.
The total number of electors in India is more than the population of Europe.
These are the vastness and enormousness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Elections are the largest democratic election ever in history.
You can imagine what a massive organization and human resources are required to complete this process.
This election was possible due to the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
On the one hand, nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces have discharged their responsibilities and on the other hand 20 lakh police personnel of different states have worked tirelessly to fulfil this great achievement of democracy.
Their hard work has resulted in more voting than the previous election.
You can imagine that 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines have been installed in this election process.
For ensuring that no one is deprived of his election.
In a remote location in Arunachal Pradesh, only one woman is made Polling Station for voters.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two days to reach that place.
This is the true honor of democracy.
This is also the highest polling station in the world.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
There is one more information that we can take pride in.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female electors is almost equal in this election.
Inspired by the fact that there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament, a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the electoral process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, many times you will hear me saying Bouquet, Book.
I wish I could give a book instead of a flower bouquet to accommodate the habituals
Another story that deepens my heart is Idgah.
The story is a child's compassion, a pure love for her sister.
When Hamid, four-five years old, took a pinch from the fair to his grandmother, it really seemed as if human love, compassion, what a wonderful thing.
The last line of this story is an infinite truth of life that teaches us, the child played the role of Hamid, the old man, the girl became an old man.
A very heartwarming story is Pus Ki Rat.
The story shows an ironic picture of the lives of a poor farmer.
The farmer is happy even after his crop is destroyed because he does not have to sleep in the fields in winter.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, yet the relevance of these stories is still the same.
After reading the story, I feel different.
When books are about to be read, I read about the library in Kerala in some media.
You will be surprised to know that the library is located in a dense forest of Idukki.
A primary school teacher, P.
V Chinnathampi worked hard for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here, filled in the bag and pressed on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction to the tribal children as well as everyone.
Gujarat's Wangche Gujarat campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people of all ages participated in the book reading campaign.
In today's digital world, in the times of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take a little time out of your daily routine and place books in your daily routine.
You must enjoy very much and write about the books you read in the NarendraModiApp so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of my country are thinking about those things which are not just present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModiApp and MyGov and I noticed that a lot of people have written about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pawan Gowda, Sitangshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and others have written about water related problems.
Our culture has a huge impact on water.
Rakveda's Upah Suktam says about water Apo Hitha Mayo Bhubah: Nasthan Norje Dadhatan, Maha Raneye Chakshase Yoh Shivatmo Rasa, Tsya Bhajayateh Nah Ushtiriv Matrah.
Many parts of the country are being damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in one year only 8 of the water received from the rain is conserved in our country.
Only 8.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that like other problems, we will find solutions to this crisis with the help of peoples participation, with the power of the people, with the capabilities, cooperation and resolve of 130 crore Indians.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Jal Shakti Ministry has been created in the country.
This will facilitate quick decision-making of all water related matters.
A few days ago, I tried to innovate something different.
I wrote letters to all the village heads of the country.
I had written to the village heads to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to hold a meeting of the Gram Sabha and to hold discussions with the villagers.
I am glad that they have given a lot of enthusiasm and on 22nd of A-Mass, crores of people have donated their hard work in thousands of panchayats.
In villages, people have resolved to collect one drop of water.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you about a village panchayat.
Listen to what the Chief of the Panchayat of Lupung village of Katakamashandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us the message: Dilip Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote our letter to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote our letter.
Once again the people there are ready to play their active role in conserving water.
I convey my best wishes to all the village heads, to all the panchayat heads and to them for their activeness.
There are several Panchayat chiefs across the country who have been engaged in water conservation.
As I said, everyone's efforts can have a big positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is to save water, conserve water.
Renovation of drainage system in Punjab is underway.
This has prevented the accumulation of water.
Construction of a reservoir at Themaipalli in Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
The construction of a small pond built in the fields of poet Radham in Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I am going to make a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women have joined hands to revive Nagnadi.
I was also studying about those women of Garhwal who are working very well to keep the rain water intact together.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, three requests have been made to the countrymen.
My first request is that just as the countrymen gave cleanliness the form of a mass movement, in the same way we launched a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we pledge to save every drop of water. I believe that the prasad obtained from Goddess is the form of water parashetra.
I launched an awareness campaign to save every drop of water.
Whether it is the world of films, the world of sports, the friends of the media, the people associated with social organizations, the people associated with cultural organizations, the artisans of dialogue, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake the society, unite and unite the society.
You see, we can see changes in front of our own eyes.
Come, let us make a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to conserve water.
You can share your content with the help of Hashtag Janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I express my gratitude to you and to all the people of the world for one more thing.
On 21st June, once again, on Yoga Day, three-four generations of every family have celebrated Yoga Day with fervour and enthusiasm.
The awareness about the Holistic Health Care is also increasing the importance of Yoga Day.
If any Yoga lover welcomes the sun with sunrise in every corner of the world, the entire journey ends with the sunset.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, renowned personalities, ordinary citizens of different countries of the world showed me how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a family full of happiness.
We are all aware of the need for a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive person, and Yoga ensures that there is a healthy society.
Therefore, the propagation and spread of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution to the promotion and upliftment of Yoga have been announced, which is a good news for me.
These awards have been conferred on those organisations of the world who have played a vital role in the propagation and spread of Yoga.
For example, Japan Yoga Niketan has made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan (Japan Yoga Niketan) runs several institutions and training courses.
And can Indians remain backward where it is related to Yoga
The Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger, Bihar has been honoured for the past several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni has also been honoured to set up Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Respecting Yoga as a symbol of Yoga and honouring those who have spread the message of Yoga at home have added diversity to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has begun with new ideas, new feelings, new resolutions and new energy.
It is important for me to associate ourselves with your ideas. Mann Ki Baat is just a minute.
May your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In the coming month, we will again interact with you at Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
I am very happy to start Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
To address this challenge before the country, we all have to forget caste, communalism, territorialism and all other disparities so that we can take stronger, stronger and effective steps against terrorism than before.
Our armed forces show their indomitable courage.
You have seen how steps have been taken within a hundred hours of terrorism.
Military forces have resolved to destroy terrorists and their narcotics.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, through the media, inspiring messages of their families came to the fore, which inspired the people of the country with utmost courage, enthusiasm and energy.
Ramnanjan ji, the father of Shahid Ratan Thakur in Bhagalpur, Bihar, inspires all of us in this sad hour.
He said that he will send his other sons to fight against the enemies of the country, and will also be present in the battlefield if necessary.
The nation is sacrificing the indomitable courage of the wife of Prasanna Sahu in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He pledged his only son to join the CRPF.
When the body of Martyr Vijay Soren, buried in the National Flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son said that he would join the ship.
With the zeal of this innocent child, this strong resolve, this feeling today reflects the feelings of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that all of us had been waiting for for so long after independence is going to end now.
It is very natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and feelings in this regard.
He was happy to note that Odupi, Karnatakas Shri Onkar Shetty ji National War Memorial has been created on the Narendra Modi App.
I was surprised and alarmed that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desh was born on 29th February.
All of you are aware that this special day comes only once in four years.
Morarji Bhai was one of the most loyal leaders of this country.
In this independent India, Morarji Bhai Desai has recorded the record of presenting the maximum budget in the Parliament.
At that difficult time, Morarji Desai gave India the right leadership when democracy was in a state of grave danger.
In order to protect this democracy, Morarji Bhai Desai dedicated himself to the movement against the Emergency.
And that is why he had to pay a lot of money even when he came to old age.
The government of that day arrested him and put him in prison.
However, when he won the Janta Party vote in 1977, he became our Prime Minister.
It was during his presidency that it was proposed to amend the 44th Constitution.
This is important because 42nd Amendment to the Emergency Condition was proposed wherein there were proposals to shrink the power of the Supreme Court and to reduce our democratic values.
For instance, the 44th Amendment Resolution provides for publication of news on all functions of the Parliament and the Assembly.
Further, some of the powers of the Supreme Court were exercised and it was proposed to amend the Constitution that the fundamental rights of the citizens should not be procured under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution in any manner due to Emergency.
Once again, I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, just like every year, there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the people about the 'Pam' award.
I want to tell you about some of these people today.
He recalled that Abdul Gafur Khatriji of Gujarat had worked surprisingly to revive the artifacts of Kutch.
He has done a wonderful job in bringing this rare industry to the new generation.
The Tree of Life, built by Abdul Gafur, was gifted to former US President Barak Obama.
Among the winners of the 'Pam' awards, everyone knows Marathwada's integrity as a servant of God.
He is unique in the way he dedicated his entire life to the service of mother cow.
Madurai Chinna Pillai is a distinguished person who has worked hard and self-reliantly for the victims and exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has trained all the people around the world at the age of 100 years and has made 1500 Yoga teachers so far.
The brave deeds of the Yamuna Todu, the planters, the mafia and the designers, known as the Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, saved not only 50 hectares of forests from devastation, but also sent 10,000 women to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna Ji, the people of the village today plant 18 trees at the time of birth of every child and 10 trees at the time of the marriage of every girl.
He dedicated himself to the virtue of making blind children self-reliant by creating an institution called Chhuksh Mahila Sevakunj.
My dear countrymen, this is the first time that 12 of those who have been awarded the Padma awards are farmers.
Ordinarily, very few people from the farm sector and those directly from the farming community are among the smallest of the beneficiaries.
And that's the vibrant image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a heartfelt feeling with all of you today. I have personally realized this thing for the past few days.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana - PM-JYA and PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I understand the transformation that has brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you are aware of any poor person who is unable to get treatment due to lack of funds, you will be aware of this scheme.
This scheme has been started for the benefit of these poor people.
My dear brothers and sisters are going to start school exams.
Several educational institutions across the country will be preparing for the examinations of the Parliament and Class II.
My best wishes to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, Pariksha Pe Charcha was organised at Town Hall Format in Delhi.
I extend my best wishes to all the students, their teachers and parents on the recording of this programme.
My dear countrymen, India will be spoken and it will not be worshipped.
Perhaps, there is no Hein Day in our country where there is no festival or festival or any special significance, because we have a thousand years old tradition.
And in a few days, Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri is on Mondays and when Shivratri falls together, our minds resonate with the pious feelings and devotion.
I am very impressed with the power of this disabled person.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience of connecting with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I face millions of families every month through radio.
Many a times, I feel like reading your letters, talking to you, or listening to your suggestions on the phone. You have made me one of your family.
It's a pleasure for me.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
For the next two months, we will be busy with elections in different ways.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He dedicated his entire life for the creation of food, shelter, education and spiritual wisdom.
Siddhaganga is the organiser of animals and agricultural meals.
I must pay my homage to such a great man.
But today I'm gonna say something else.
Imagine, just one voter.
If you're unsuccessful to vote for any reason, you're gonna have to be very disappointed.
I would like to appeal to all the citizens of the country to come and enroll the Electoral Roll Electoral Roll Electoral Roll and also to all the citizens of the country.
I believe that the number of youngsters will be enrolled and our democracy will be strengthened by the participation of the electorate.
It was here that the Raza rulers enquired about the brave Colonel Prem Sehgal of Mother India, Col.
Whenever I was looking at the topics related to Netaji in the Red Fort, the family members of Netaji gave me a special gift.

This month before December 30, I had visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.

Over the years, there was a goddess who would make all the files related to Netaji public.
I'm glad we're doing this.
On that day, I came to know that Netaji's family had served as the Prime Minister's residence.
I am told that Radio Station Weekly Weekly is being promoted in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Book, Urdu.
The great guru was born in the landscape.
The museum is a historic exhibition and is being conserved in the 450 Old Generation Observing Art Works.

My dear countrymen, in December this year, we have lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Jayachandran died in Chennai on 19th December.
Narasamma was a helper in delivering pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
He was awarded the Padma Shri earlier this year.
Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti have many exemplary personalities like Narasamma, who have laid down their lives for the betterment of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of the doctors in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some officers of my party inform me that some young doctors of the city are treating the poor free of cost by camping.
Now every month hundreds of poor people are getting benefitted from this camp.
The zeal and enthusiasm of these doctors and friends who have been serving selflessly is really commendable.
Today, I can proudly say that our collective efforts have made the Swachh Bharat Mission a success.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this Mahayagya of Swachhata, Nagar Nigam, Voluntary Organizations, school-college students, common people of Jabalpur participated with enthusiasm.
This is where I can learn about Dr. Jayachandran.
Whenever there is time, I would like to go to The Batter India.com and try to know about such inspirational issues.
I am glad that today there are several websites that introduce us to the story of life of inspirational people.
You can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home through Sanskrit Bharati.
I believe that many people will be able to know about these heroes who bring about change in society.
It is easier to spread negativity, however, a lot of good work is being done in our society around us and this is possible because of the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a special significance in every society.
Whenever there is a sport, the audience is filled with fervor.
I would like to mention about Hanya Nisar, a daughter of Kashmir, who has won a gold medal in the Caratage in Korea.
The twelfth year, Hanya lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
I wish all the countrymen a bright future.
Many congratulations and blessings to Honey.
Similarly, there is a lot of discussion in the media about another daughter and sixteen Rajini.
You must have read it.
Rajini has won Gold in Girls Junior Boxing Championships.
He did this in honor of his father Jasmer Singh, who sold Losie at a waterway shop.
Rajini informed that his father had to admit a lot of sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh went to work every morning before Rajani and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajini expressed his desire to learn boxing to his father, to enhance his enthusiasm, he tried his best to make his dream come true.
Rajini started boxing practices with an old glove because his family wasn't in a financial condition.
Despite all contradictions, Rajini did not lose courage and taught boxing.
He won a medal in Serbia too.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate his parents, Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani for being with Rajini and for encouraging him.
This month, twenty-two-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni cycle of Pune has achieved the pride of being the fastest-growing Asian.
It has been cycling around 300 km per day for 159 days.
Imagine 300 kilometers of cycling every day.
His indomitable spirit towards cycling is truly commendable.
Contradiction is never a barrier.
When we listen to other such examples, we also inspire in every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there are many festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi etc.
During these festivals, the colour of traditional dances and harvests will be reflected in the joy of harvesting the crops of Lohri, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the sky.
Sports will be organised somewhere and sweets will be offered to each other.
The names of these festivals are different but their purpose is to celebrate the festivals in some way or the other, which are associated with agriculture and rural life.
This is the time when the sun rises and the sun enters the Capricorn.
Since then, the day begins to grow gradually and the days of winter harvest begin.
My best wishes to the farmer brothers and sisters of Annadata on this occasion.
The vision of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in the joyous festival of unity in diversity.
We can see how closely these festivals are associated with nature.
Indian culture does not see society and nature separately, where individuals and groups are united.
Another wonderful example of our intimacy with nature is the festival calendar.
These calendars also contain details of planetary constellations throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and scientific events is.
Based on the moon and sun speed, these lunar calendars will determine the dates of festivals and festivals.
It depends on whoever follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to be held at different locations.
The festivals such as Gudi Padwa, Cheti Chand, Ugadi are observed according to the lunar calendar and are observed in Tamil Puthandu and Vishu, Vaishakh, Vaishakh, Payla Vaishakh, Bihu etc.
Many of our mountains are also inherent in conserving rivers and water.
Six Parvati rivers and ponds are associated with the worship of the Sun.
Millions of people bathe in the holy rivers in Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, on the other hand, these festivals inspire each other to develop fraternity with each other in a very simple way.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to you all for 2019. May you enjoy these festivals very much.
Photos on the occasion of the Festival share with all of you so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are so many things in our culture that we can take pride in and we can show the entire world that the Kumbh Mela is like this.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
In many cinemas, this fair has been depicted in a variety of aspects of its legacy and its vastness and it is true that the Kumbh is as rich as its heritage.
People from the country and all over the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Congregation is being celebrated with confidence and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and abroad are coming together.
The Kumbh tradition has been nurtured and nurtured by our great cultural heritage.
Saint-Mahatmara has started arriving for Kumbh.
Last year, UNESCO has registered the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries witnessed the preparations for Kumbh.
National flags of several countries were unfurled there.
More than 150 people of the country are expected to visit the Kumbh Mela organized at Prayagraj.
It can be a very big learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are underway.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in Kumbh.
This symbol of human faith was locked in the fort for thousands of years so that the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted it.
Now the doors of the Akshay Boat are open for everyone.
My appeal to you is that whenever you visit Kumbh then you must share the unique features and images of Kumbh on social media so that more and more people are motivated to visit Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the Republic Day celebrations have been celebrated with great zeal and remembrance of those great men who gave us our Constitution.
This year we mark the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
Fortunately, the President of South Africa, Mr. Siriel Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day this year.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood against discrimination.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm, from where the voice of peace in the entire world emerged.
He had the courage to spend so many years in prison and the motivation to live in revered Bapu.
Mandela said, "God is an integral part of our history because here he used to experiment on the path of truth first.
There is a detailed discussion on what steps are needed to strengthen the security of the country and its people.
At this conference, I have announced the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration which will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in some way or the other.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his life for the unity of the country.
He has worked throughout his life to maintain India's integration.
He said that the unity of the country lies in the diversity of the country.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award for his honour.
My dear countrymen, on January 13, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
Most of his life was his workplace in North India and he gave up his last breath at Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the work place in North India and the last time in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has received his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, the biggest service is to alleviate the sufferings of people.
He was blessed with valour, valour, sacrifice and ritualism.
Weapons and scriptures were his extraordinary knowledge.
On the one hand he was an archer, on the other hand Gurumukhi, Braj Bhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and English.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are good things happening in the country which are not widely discussed.
Several events are being organised across the country to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Creating safe and healthy food habits.
As part of the Eat Right India campaign, Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organized across the country.
The expedition will continue till 27th January, 2019.
India will be prosperous only when it becomes clean and healthy.
Nutritious diet is the first requirement for good health.
Be it individual life or national life or social life, the source of inspiration is progress.
Come, let us move ahead with inspiration, innovation, new resolutions, new goals, new heights and change our country.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
Today, the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
Golden Jubilee Episode is a golden episode.
Most of the letters and phone calls that have been received have been told about the 50th edition.
Manika Jain from Delhi, Sangeeta Sastri from West Bengal, Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur, and Manika Jain from Delhi on the Narendra Modi App.
This question is very common.
In today's era, when people almost forgot the radio, why did Modi bring the radio back there
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to the radio.
I heard on the radio, we're discussing the bombing.
The shopkeeper said that the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said on the radio that the historic significance of the testing of the atomic bomb was the significance of that day.
The shopkeeper's gentleman is happy to see the dance and I was wondering if this place is deserted, this place is covered with snow and this shop is listening to the radio in his shop throughout the day.
I am thinking of the Radio Communication Reach and its far-reaching impact.
Next time, when I am the Prime Minister, I will take the help of the most powerful connectivity.
Since May 2014, when I started as the Chief Servant, I felt that the unity of our country, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity and the diversity of the people, their men, their emotions, their devotion, their penance and their penance should be spread to all the people of the country.
I have reached to the 50th episode of reading letters every month, listening to the phone calls, learning about the various apps and simultaneously talking about my own kind of fun.
The results of the survey are very encouraging.
Seventy percent of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people believe that Mann Ki Baat has created positive thinking among all sections of society.
The peoples movement through Mann Ki Baat has expanded immensely.
There was a lot of discussion on Hass Tag India Positive.
It is such a smooth change that people are moving a long way towards social service.
Modi will come and go but our country will endure forever and our culture will remain immortal.
These small stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
A new inspiration filled with enthusiasm will take the country to greater heights.
I read letters and feel such feelings in them and work with them in mind.
I have understood both these things myself and shared them with you and I share with you all.
But who knows when these words will go home.
There will be so much power of a government that starts from a small village in Haryana, not only in the country but also in the entire world, with the help of selfie with daughter.
Every section of the society, even celebrities, has been associated with this thing and the thinking of the society has been depicted in a modern language-speaking manner that inspires the modern generation.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat was funny but I always remember 130 crore Indians.
Their minds are my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government, it is about society.
There are many aspects of life in which politics is one aspect.
Politics cannot be a reflection of a healthy social order.
Sometimes political events or political persons become so important that other talents of society become neglected.
It is the collective responsibility of all of us to take care of the talent of mankind and other aspects of society for a bright future like India. Mann Ki Baat is a humble step towards this goal.
I believe that the biggest achievement of Mann Ki Baat in the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking the Prime Minister but also asking a close friend of yours.
There is also a toll-free number - 1  7800, where people call and record their message.
I have been trying to get as many letters and comments as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I've heard a lot of phone calls.
As the Mann Ki Baat episode progresses, I keep reading the suggestions and ideas that you have sent while traveling to different places.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have spent 40-45 years of my life as a preacher and have spent a lot of time in most of the districts of the country.
And that's why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself to that place.
Thereafter, I note some information such as village, individual name.
To be honest, I have a voice in Mann Ki Baat but for example, emotions and energy from my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whose names I have not been able to take up Mann Ki Baat till date but they are not disappointed and send their letters and comments.
I have full faith that your message will come to me much more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more psychological, effective and useful.
It was also tried that all the letters which were not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be addressed by the concerned department.
I would like to thank all the media, Doordarshan, other TV channels and friends of social media of All India Radio.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching out to the maximum number of people with their hard work.
The Prime Minister said that it is a matter of great pride for the people of India.
I would like to congratulate them for their talents and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this programme in your vernacular languages.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to all those friends from the media who are regularly running Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political person is satisfied with the media, he feels that he is covered very little, or is negatively covered, but many issues published in the Mann Ki Baat programme are covered by the media.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Nidhi ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
I usually say I have no secret.
What I'm doing is perhaps every family.
In a simple language, I try to create myself like those youngsters. I try to keep myself in that position and try to create a wave length match by keeping in mind their views.
We have some old baggages in our own life, and if we don't show them, it's easy to understand.
We don't understand how each one of us has left his mind and confessed to the other.
The quality of the present youth is that he doesn't believe in himself, and when he believes in something, he leaves everything behind him.
Often people used to discuss the community gap between the elders of the family and the Teenagers.
But most of the households had limited discussions with the Teenagers.
Most of the time you talk about studies or habits, lifestyles - do this, don't do it.
It is also a matter of concern that unconditional and open-minded conversations are gradually being reduced to family members.
Any media gets an impetus if it changes the expectation and does not negotiate.
I have been in constant touch with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I always learn from the thinking of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Youngsters are entrepreneurs, innovators and individuals.
Some say that young students want to work together.
I'll tell you, what's bad about it
They are skilled in multi-tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, be it social initiatives or be it start-ups or be it sports or any other sector, the youngsters bring about a big change in the society.
Young men who dare to question and dream.
If we can give up our decision-making capabilities on youngsters and if they can express their thoughts openly, they can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MyGov web site, Vinita ji wrote that this time on Mann Ki Baat, we need to talk about the Constitution Day on November 26, 2019.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventy years after the constitution of India.
Vinita ji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
Remember those great personalities who have enacted our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this historic task of drafting the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these great talented people have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The kind of extraordinary pace at which they have enacted the Constitution is a unique example of time management and productivity today.
Inspired by this, we also need to finish our responsibilities on record.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of the great talented people of the country, in which everyone was responsible for giving a Constitution to the nation so that the people of India empowered and the poorest of the poor became a supporter.
The main features of our Constitution are the rights and duties detailed in detail.
The balance between the lives of the citizens of the country will take the country forward.
If we respect each other's rights then you will be protected and if we perform our duties in the Constitution then our rights will also be protected.
I remember that in 2010, 60 years of India's democracy, in Gujarat, we had made a process by placing the Constitution on the back of the elephants.
It was a memorable effort to educate the youngsters about the Constitution and to inspire them about the various streams of their Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we will complete 70 years and we will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all respect the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, prosperity and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Baba Saheb, who has given the right to save crores of Indians with respect.
The Republic of India was a part of Babasaheb's thoughts and he used to say that India's democratic ideals are not external.
The definition of Republic or Parliamentary system was not new to India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had an emotional urge that this freedom was achieved after a long battle and that is why we have to protect it from the last mile of our blood.
He used to say that no matter how much we Indians are growing in different environments, the well-being of the nation is always a priority.
Once again I pay my homage to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days back on 23rd November, we celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev, and will celebrate 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished the welfare of mankind.
He has always shown the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to society.
Our country will soon celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev, which will be published and spread all over the world.
All States and Union Territories have been requested to observe this day with Dhammadham.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the world.
A train will also be run across all the holy places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Recently when I was discussing this thing then I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
The Gurudwara was severely damaged during the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, but the manner in which the state government restored the Gurudwara along with the local people is exemplary.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th edition, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat, I believe that for the first time I got the opportunity to share my thoughts on Mann Ki Baat with you people because you wanted to know about it.
Our journey will continue.
The more I get your help, the deeper this journey will be and more satisfying.
Sometimes people ask me what I got from Mann Ki Baat.
Today, I want to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart. Most of the people have said that when they sit in the family and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme then they feel that the god of the family is sharing their views with them.
When I came to know this thing in detail that I am one of you, one of you, and you have made me big, I am very happy that I will come here again and again as a family member through Mann Ki Baat and I will meet you all.
Your conscience, I'm sure.
Let us take this journey further.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
I would like you all to participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
About six and a half months prior to independence, a photograph of Sardar Patel was published in an edition of the famous international magazine Time magazine on January 27, 1947.
The Time Servant gave India a map in his Lead Story.
There were more than 550 indigenous states then.
Though the British were interested in India, they wanted to disintegrate the country.
The Time magazine wrote that India had the dangers like separatism, jealousy, food crisis, price rise and power politics but if anyone has the power to unite the country then it is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel that the problems of states are so serious that you can solve them only.
Sardar Patel indeed found a way to solve the problems one by one and also made the impossible task of uniting the entire country.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivandrum or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel is the only person whose intellectual ideas and strategy we can see unbroken India today.
This country bound by unity and seeing Mother India naturally reminds us of the memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, Sardar Patels birth anniversary is even more important because as a tribute to him, we will deliver the Statue of Unity to the nation.
Established on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the Statue of Liberty, USA has doubled its height.
It will be the world's highest skyscraper architecture.
Every Indian can proudly say that the tallest statue in the world is now in India.
I believe that this unique architecture across the country will be a favourite example.
This is the day when the Indian Army had landed on the soil of Kashmir and protected the valley from the intruders.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old meeting of the great soldier of India Sammaneksh.
Field Marshal Maneksh spoke of the time when he was a colonel.
At that time, a military operation was launched in Kashmir in 1974.
Field Marshal Maneksh said that in a meeting to delay the deployment of troops in Kashmir, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was disturbed and during the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at his habit and said that there should not be any delay in military operations in Kashmir and we need to solve this problem as soon as possible.
On 31st October, the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Tributes to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in sports.
These are the measurements of success of a sportsperson.
On the other hand, these four qualities are important for nation building.
With these qualities among the youth of any country, they will not only improve the country's economy, science and technology but will also showcase the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I've had two meetings, to be remembered.
First of all, I had the opportunity to meet Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
India won 72 medals in this Games and made a mark in the country's honour.
We have won 3 more medals in Mix events in addition to 13 medals.
You must remember that this time the Asian Federation too was very good for India.
Look, in the last few minutes, how many times I've used the best, the most beautiful words.
He was eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After quitting orphanage, he used to clean DTC buses and waiter on the road side to drive life.
This Narayana has won the gold medal for India at the International event today.
Not only this, the field of sports in India is expanding in such a scenario that India has not won any medal in Judiciary or Senior Level till date, where Tawabi has made history of silver winning Judo in Youth Olympics.
Sixteen year old Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father sells a daily wage and mother fish.
Sometimes there was such a situation that they did not even have the money to buy food.
Things like this have also defeated Tawabi Devi's spirit.
He made history by winning medals for the country.
There are many other stories like this, the source of inspiration for each one of them.
Every young sportsperson is an introduction to a New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember that we successfully organized the FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has been appreciated by the world's most successful tournaments.
The FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECT broke the audience.
More than 12 lakh audiences watched football and motivated young athletes in various stadiums across the country.
This time, India has achieved the privilege of World Cup Hockey Organisation in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves sports has a different place in his mind.
India has a golden history at the Hockey Games.
India has won gold several times in the past and has won colours once again.
Some world class athletes have also made presents in Indias hockey sports.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in any place in the world, India's name will be left incomplete.
Hawke's wizard Major Dhyan Chand is known all over the world.
Besides, Balbinder Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Saheed, from Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai Hockey has made India proud in the world.
Even today, the hockey players of Team India are setting an example of success for the new generation with their hard work and dedication.
It is a wonderful experience for sports enthusiasts to sit at the stadium.
While visiting Bhubaneswar, the team will encourage not only the Indians but also the entire nation.
There is a tradition of prosperity and cultural excellence and the people of Odisha must be motivated and remembered.
It is also an excellent opportunity for sports lovers to visit Odisha.
I also convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, a lot of people are moving ahead in the social service and volunteering and it is becoming an inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has committed himself to learning a wheelchair basketball to play a basketball in the wheelchair.
This mentality, this self-determination is the mission mode activity.
There will be no Indian who will not be proud of these things.
I am not ours will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was looking at your suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, I got an opportunity to see a very exciting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov: Please talk about how the tribal and their traditions of India become the best example of uniting the tradition with nature.
There is a need to learn from them what to do for the Sustainable Development.
Manish ji, I express my gratitude to all of you for putting this thing in front of the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is something that inspires me to look back to our glorious past and culture. Today, the whole world, especially the Western countries, is discussing the conservation of the environment and is looking for a new path for its balanced lifestyle.
Today, even our India is not far from this problem, but we have to undertake a review to solve this problem.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Bat and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way to preserve the environment.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for conservation of trees, but they are not ready to admit the loss of a tree.
Arunachal's admirers demand their relationship with the tigers.
They call him their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the tiger is seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Worli community of Maharashtra regard the tiger as a guest and their habitat is a symbol of prosperity.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their destiny is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not mix food then the villagers should also be indispensable.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing at some places in the breeding season.
These places are known as fishing shelters, and they mix fresh fish in large quantities.
The tribal communities make their homes from natural material which is strengthened and environment friendly.
In southern India, there is a small tribe in the eastern part of the Nilgiri Mountains, which, according to tradition, makes their settlements locally.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and united together but whenever anybody harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
Its not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, tribal communities were amongst them.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against British rule to protect his forests
There are several examples of tribal communities that teach us how to save our lives in harmony with nature and our country is indebted to the tribal communities for the forest wealth that remains around us.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we will talk about those people and their problems who have been doing something extraordinary for the society.
These are the works that seem to be simple but really far-reaching impacts on changing our mindset and setting the goals of our society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
Gurubachan Singh ji's son was married to an ordinary and hardworking farmer.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji told the parents of Connor that they will do this marriage uninterruptedly.
He suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, when we say a condition in marriage, it seems that he is going to talk about some big money, he will want something that will make Conn's family difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a simple white farmer and he told Conn's father that the conditions that we are talking about are the real strength of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You promise me that from now on, you will not be able to wipe out the remains that will be left after harvesting the crops in the fields.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden in it.
This feels extraordinary, but it is his personality and we have seen that there are so many families in our society who have transformed the individuals into the good work of society.
Shri Gurubachan Singh jis family set an example.
I read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near Navar.
Kallar Majra was in the headline because the people there did not burn the rice straw and mixed it with the soil.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and those places who are making their best efforts to clean the environment.
You all are taking forward the healthy lifestyle of Indian inheritance.
Just as drops of water produce the ocean, such small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance for the eleventh of November this year, as the first World War was concluded on 11th November, a hundred years ago.
It means that the end of the terrible destruction and mass destruction will be hundred years.
The First World War is an important event for India.
To be honest, we had nothing to do with this great war.
Yet, the soldiers of our country fought with brave-hearts, played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they are not behind anyone in the battlefield.
Our soldiers showed valour in difficult situations in the remote areas.
This was the only purpose of restoring peace.
In the First World War, the whole world saw the phenomenon of destruction.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and as many civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the entire world realised the importance of peace.
Over the last hundred years, the language of peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a special feature in the North-East of this country.
The natural beauty here is incomparable and the people here are also very talented.
Our Northeast is now known for its best and noblest work.
It's a place where organic farming has grown very well.
A few days ago, the Sustainable Food System, which means that Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award for promoting long-term food systems.
The award was conferred on behalf of FAO, a United Nations organization, Food and Agriculture Organization.
