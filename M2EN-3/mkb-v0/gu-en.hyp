Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Diwali.
My best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The shloka says: Light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys contrary intelligence and shows goodwill.
What better idea could be to remember this Divya Jayanti, to spread light, to spread positivity and to pray for the eradication of hostility.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that it not only includes the Indian community but also celebrates the festival of Diwali with great joy, the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations there.
In a way, India emerges there.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world has its own attraction.
There is immense possibilities of festivals in our country.
It should be our endeavour to spread such festivals be it Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and to involve other states and people from other countries in the happiness of festivals.
There are so many festivals of each state and of every region that the people of other countries are very interested in them.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in Gay Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that this Diwali will do something different.
Let us celebrate India's women power and achievements, that is to honour India's Laxmi.
And immediately afterwards, innumerable inspirational stories emerged on social media.
It is written on the Namo App that my mother is my power.
Since the demise of my father in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of our fifth daughter.
Today, we are in the fifth best business.
My mother is God for me.
For me, it is universal and in true sense it is the Laxmi of India.
Ramesh ji, my salute to your mother.
Deepika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the Laxmi of India, who is the daughter of a bus conductor.
India's Laxmi is her daughter for poetry trivari.
He is proud that his daughter performs beautiful paintings.
He has secured a good rank in the CLAT examination.
So Megha Jain ji has also written that for the past two years, an old woman of two years has been giving free water to the passengers at Gualior Railway Station.
Meghaji is deeply inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
So many stories have been shared by people.
You must read, get inspiration and if there is such an inspiring story around you then share it.
My heartiest congratulations to all these Lakshmis of India.
It seems that its foundation was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how good feelings and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language.
Peninda Permegondu Himavantnu, Panindita Bhrigu Perchidinda Jankarayanu Jasavedanu Artha, Himavat i.e. Parvaraj, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigu Rishi became famous because of his daughter Lakshmi and Raja Janke because of her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and it is due to the majesty of these dilemmas that our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th November, 2019 is a day to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Devji across the world.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the entire world.
In some countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are completely dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I will never forget my visit to Vancouver and the Gurudwara in Tahrain.
There is so much that I can tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji, but for that many episodes of Mann Ki Baat are required.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji delivered his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travelling persons of his time.
He went to many places and won everyones hearts with ease, humility and simplicity wherever he went.
Taking the message of goodwill and equality, they went in every direction be it north or south, east or west.
It is believed that the famous Sant Shankar Dev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had himself solved the problem of water.
Gurnankar Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bidar which reminds us of Guru Nanak Devji.
During a sad hour, Guru Rananak Dev ji also travelled to Kashmir and surrounding areas in the north.
It established good relations between Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him as a Guru.
He is also revered in Uzbekistan where he had visited.
He found a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who followed his teachings with full devotion and are doing it even today.
Just a few days ago, the ambassadors of about 85 countries had moved from Delhi to Amritsar.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this became the celebration of the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, a number of Ambassadors put their pictures on social media and narrated their good experiences with pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that on 31st October all of you will be remembered.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was the great hero of unity for the country.
While Sardar Patel had the wonderful ability to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to co-ordinate himself with those who had ideological differences.
He was a true Man of Details.
At the same time, he was well-versed in organizational skills.
He was invited to formulate and strategize schemes.
Whenever we read and listen to Sardar Saheb's work culture, we get to know that his organisation was so powerful.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were expected to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 121.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the overall system of the session. He also used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
And he ensured that no one faced water problem.
Not only this, he was also cautious about the fact that the luggage or footprint of a delegate should not be stolen at the session place and in view of that, Sardar Patel would be surprised to know what he did.
He contacted farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags.
On the other hand, there has also been a good increase in the sale of Khadi.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel had done a very big work of uniting the princely states, a great Bhagirath and a historic one.
Sardar Vallabhbhais vision was at every step.
On the one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his focus was on Durgadur Lakshadweep.
In fact, when we talk of Sardar Patel's efforts then the role of him in the unity of the country is also discussed.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour's gaze was on Lakshadweep and he sent a ship along with his flag.
It was known to Sardar Patel that he immediately initiated tough action without wasting time and without delay.
After his orders, the tri-colours were fluttered and destroyed every mood in the neighborhood for capturing Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Muslim brothers to personally ensure that they get the necessary help for the development of the Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to India's progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination.
I hope all of you will visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, October 31, 2018 is the day on which the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty, which is located in the USA, has doubled its altitude.
The world's tallest statue fills every Indian with pride.
The glory of every Indian is elevated by glory.
You will be happy to know that more than 26 lakh tourists have come to visit the Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that everyday about eight and a half thousand people showed the grandeur of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for tourism industry for the country and for all the states.
We all are witnesses to the fact that within a year, a place is developing into a world famous tourist destination.
People from India and abroad come there.
Traffic, lodging, guide and environment friendly systems are developing automatically.
A big economy is developing and people are developing facilities as per the requirements of tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, Whether there will be such an India which would not be proud of the fact that in the last few days, the time magazine has also given importance to the Statue of Unity in 100 important tourist places of the world.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of your valuable time to see the Statue of Unity.
This is my request.
Friends, You are aware that every year from 2014, 31st October is celebrated as National Unity Day.
This day sends us a message to safeguard our country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
Unity Run for Unity is also being organised every time on 31st October.
This will include people from all walks of life.
However, nowadays, people are witnessing a hobby and a public sentiment for marathon.
Run for Unity is also a unique vision.
Running is beneficial for all mind, mind and body.
The spirit of Fit India is realized by the race here.
At the same time, we are also associated with the objective of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body, mind and values are connecting India to new heights for the unity of India.
And that is why you can connect the city wherever you live, you can connect yourself with the information about the Run for Unity.
I hope that all of you will run on 31st October for the unity and fitness of India.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel united the country.
This mantra of unity has become a value in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every stage of every moment at every stage of waiting.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in strengthening the unity and mutual goodwill of the country.
If we look around, there will be several examples that have been working continuously for enhancing mutual goodwill.
But sometimes it becomes such that the efforts made by the society die very soon from the memory.
Friends, I remember that when the Allahabad High Court in September 2010 had announced its contribution to the Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember those days, what kind of atmosphere was there then.
Some of the groups of their own interests were playing games to take advantage of this situation.
What kind of language was being spoken in order to create heat in the environment
Efforts were also made to fill the voices with different voices.
Efforts were made to reduce the strain from the environment.
This thing should always be remembered that it gives us great strength.
That is a moment of gratitude for all of us.
This is an example of how the voice of unity can give strength to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to him.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have listened to these things and I think I have heard you too.
Just imagine, the world's highest battlefield or its temperature goes from zero to 50-60 degree minus.
The name of oxygen in air is also merely one .
Staying in the midst of such challenges is no less than a paradigm.
In such a difficult situation, our brave Jawans take out their chests and protect the borders of the country but they are running a clean Siachen campaign there too.
I compliment the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold there that it is difficult to rot.
In such a situation, separating and managing waste is an important task in itself.
We all know that Siachen is such a snowy place which is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness drive there means ensuring clean water for the people living in the deserted areas and also using the waters of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a celebration of a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And especially in Deepawali there is a need to buy something new, to bring something from the market and to produce something in small quantities in every family.
I once said that we should try to buy local items.
If we get what we need from our village then we dont need to go to Taluka.
If you get to Taluka, you do not need to go to the district.
We will try to buy as many local items as possible.
Gandhi Sardha Shatabdi will be a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been insisting that we should purchase something made by the Khadi workers who are handmade by our weaver brothers and sisters.
This Diwali too must have bought a lot of money before Diwali.
But there will be many people who might have thought that if I go after Diwali then perhaps it would be a little cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people whose purchases will still be there.
So along with the best wishes of Diwali, I would urge you to come forward to buy local items and buy local items.
You see, how important we can play in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
In Deepawali, we grow different kinds of stripes.
But sometimes there is a hurdle in indifference.
Any injury occurs.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately, there will be an Indian who does not take pride in our armed forces and our soldiers.
Every Indian, be it any region, species, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the persecutors of the Prixi War under the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces organised exhibitions at different locations in the country so that more and more citizens, especially the younger generation, can know what our strengths are, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives at risk.
A day like Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the glorious legacy of our armed forces.
And it inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, the land of brave-hearts. Now it has been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to stimulating it, but in accordance with dignity and in the values of the sovereignty of the nation, it is not at all.
India has always been committed and committed to peace.
Over a lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for peace in the two World Wars of the 20th century, when we had nothing to do with that war.
Our eyes never existed on any other earth.
That was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on the 23rd of September, we recalled our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur lensers who had freed Haifa from the inventors.
This was also a milestone in the direction of peace by our soldiers.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
One of the eager part of the parade that people are eagerly waiting for during the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past in which our Air Force demonstrates its strength with wonderful cars.
On 8th October, we observe the Air Force Day.
Moving ahead with 6 pilots and 17 air warriors in 1932, our Air Force has become one of the braveest and most powerful Air Force of the 21st century today.
I convey my sincere congratulations to all air warriors and their families who are serving the nation.
When Pakistan's invaders launched an unprecedented attack in 1947, the air force was the one who ensured that the Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield in time to save Srinagar from the attacks.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the struggle for Bangladesh's independence in 1919
Air Force has also played a vital role in liberating Kargil from captivity in 1991.
In Tiger Hill, the air force licked the enemies with dustbins day and night at enemy locations.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the nation is grateful to our air warriors for their commendable work.
Their morale has been wonderful in dealing with natural calamities from storms, storms, floods to forest fires and helping the countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving the women the option of the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15 August this year.
India can proudly say that not only men power but women power is also contributing equally to the armed forces of India.
Nari is not only empowered but is also becoming an armed force.
My dear countrymen, last days, one of our naval personnel, Abhilash Tomy, was fighting his life and death.
The entire country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he was moving ahead with his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean. But the terrible sea storm created difficulties for him.
I had met Tomy earlier also.
Even after coming out of such a crisis, his courage was steadfast and his determination to do something like this once again is inspiring for the younger generation of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tomy and his courage, his might, his determination, his determination to win and win will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows what is the significance of 2nd October for our nation.
2nd October this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi across the world.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or a great personality like Nelson Mandela, everyone could take strength from Gandhijis thoughts and fought a long battle to empower their people with equality and respect.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you another important task of revered Bapu, which more and more countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas in the form of a constructive programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle began to gain momentum, he prepared a revamped copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu has placed his thoughts before the countrymen on a variety of topics like protecting the rights of farmers, villages and labourers, cleanliness and spreading education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a peoples collector.
It was Bapu's specialty to get connected with the people and to associate them with him, he was in his nature.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every individual feel that it is most important and absolutely essential for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
In the freedom struggle movement, on the call of Mahatma Gandhi, people from all walks of life dedicated themselves.
Bapu gave us all an inspiring mantra which is often known as Gandhijis footsteps.
In that, Gandhiji had said, I give you one gentleman, whenever you are doubtful that whenever you start roaming around you, try this test, recall the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen and ask your heart how useful the steps you are thinking about taking
Would it benefit
Can he control his own life and destiny
It means that it will provide self-rule to crores of people who are hungry in their stomach and are not satisfied with their soul
Then you will see that your doubts are getting better and that is getting over.
My dear countrymen, Gandhijis unity is equally important today.
Today, the growing middle class in the country, its growing economic power and the growing buying power can we remember the venerable Bapu for a moment
Can we remember that veneration of revered Bapu
What will be the fortune that will be beneficial to your purchase directly or in a fraudulent manner
And if the poorest of the poor gets the benefit then my happiness will be greater.
In the days to come whenever we buy something in the memory of Gandhiji, whenever we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must think that every purchase of ours requires a countryman. And in that too, those who have put their sweat, those who have dedicated their money to their talent, all should benefit from it.
This is the Jantar of Gandhi and this is the message of Gandhi. And I believe that a small step of yours can bring about a big result in the lives of the poorest and the weakest person.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that when we will get freedom then perhaps he would not know how this would happen.
Similarly, today we can feel that my small work can be a big contribution in the economic progress of my country, in the economic empowerment of my country and in the fight against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era, this is the work done by Bapu.
For example, if you think of buying Khadi and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to keep Khadi's old or fried clothes alive because some hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are made with a lot of hard work.
This feeling of love for the countrymen and for the countrymen was based on the path of great pride.
After two days we will celebrate Shastri ji's birth anniversary along with revered Bapu.
As the name of Shastri ji comes to light, we feel a sense of immense devotion to the people of India.
His gentle personality always fills every citizen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastrijis specialty was that he had been humble from outside but he was firmly determined like a mountain from inside.
His son, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, is a recognition of his immense personality.
It was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that during his brief tenure of one and a half years, he had given mantras to take the countrys soldiers and farmers to the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering venerated Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot live without talking about cleanliness.
From 15th September, a campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva was launched.
Crores of people joined this campaign and I am also fortunate that I would do Swachhta Shramdaan with the children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school where the foundation stone was laid by revered Babasaheb.
People from all walks of life from across the country joined the Shramdan on 15th.
Institutions also contributed to Rangcheng in it.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organizations, Media Groups, corporate world, everyone participated in Swachhta Shramdaan at large.
I congratulate all the Swachhta lovers for this thing from the core of my heart.
Let's hear a phone call-Namaskar
Cleanliness has its own significance in everyones lives and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a toilet has been constructed in your homes and now you people are getting better facilities.
Perhaps the people associated with this mission are not even aware that you cannot see because of being a wise man but if you dont have a toilet then you might have to live with so much difficulty. And it has become a big boon for you people after construction of toilets.
Perhaps you didn't even call this aspect to talk about it. Perhaps this sensitive aspect does not come in the attention of the people associated with the cleanliness drive.
I especially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
This time, India is hosting the worlds largest Swachhta Sammelan in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention i. e.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will culminate on 2nd October 2018 with the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
It is especially necessary to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the oppressed, the oppressed and the deprived.
Dr.
The Constitution passed by Babasaheb Ambedkar has given several provisions to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on October 12, 13.
After a few days, NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to enhance human dignity.
Our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the former Prime Minister of our country, had categorically stated that human rights are no different concept for us.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideal thread of the Vedic era.
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, and for the best democratic values, I believe that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society we need to understand and practice the importance of human rights. That is the basis of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the month of October, the birth anniversary of Jayanti of Jayaprakash Narayan or be it the beginning of the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayaraj Scindia ji, all these great men have been inspiring us all, we bow down to him and we bow down to Sardar Saheb on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb.
This year also, we will try to organise 'Run for Unity' in our village, city, city and metropolis.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb as he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to reinforce our efforts to unite every section of the society and every section of the country through the Run for Unity on 31st October and that will be a great tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
There are many such stories in the history of the country in which one Rakshadi had linked two different princes or religions with the stories of faith.
The festival of Janmashtami is also coming after a few days.
Elephants, horses, palanquins, Jaya Kanya Lal Ki, Govinda Govinda's Jai Gobindosh.
The joy of painting in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami greetings to all the countrymen.
My greetings to all fellow citizens on Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to Dairy Chinmayi for taking up this issue.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in preserving this great legacy, taking nutrition to the masses.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest in the world.
And we all Indians take pride in the fact that Sanskrit has played a very important role in spreading knowledge from the Vedas to the present.
Sanskrit language and its literature have a storehouse of knowledge related to every sphere of life.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for conversations.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which eternal words can be created.
Creation of countless words is possible through 200 metals, 200 accuracy i. e.
And therefore, any subtle emotion or subject can be surely expressed.
That is, if a Guru teaches his student a letter then there is nothing or money in the whole world so that the student can take away that loan from his Guru.
Let us celebrate Teachers Day with this feeling: Knowledge and Guru are invaluable, precious and invaluable.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
I also thank you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this month brings new hopes for our hardworking farmers.
Monsoon provides relief to dry trees, small and dry reservoirs in the scorching heat.
But sometimes it brings rain and destruction.
Nature has developed such a situation that some places have received more rainfall than others.
We have just seen that Kerala has had a very bad impact on life.
Today, the entire country stands with Kerala in this difficult situation.
Our compassion is with those families.
I am confident that Kerala will soon be able to meet with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state.
But in times of disasters, we also see humanity.
Wherever an offensive occurs, whether it is in Kerala or any other district of India or region, everywhere from Kutch to Kamrup to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other in their respective places to make life normal again.
People from all age groups and from all walks of life are contributing.
We all know that the armed forces are dry in the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned to save people from floods.
Whether it is the Air Force, the Navy, the Ground Force or the BSF, the CISF, the RAF, everyone has played a very important role in the rescue and relief operations.
I would like to especially mention the hard work done by the brave soldiers of NDRF.
The topic on which people from all over the country have written the most is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Swapna Benerji, from Katihar in Bihar, Akhil Pandey, who knows, many innumerable people have written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and on MyGov urging me to talk about various aspects of Atal jis life.
On 16th August, the country and the world listened to the news of Atal ji's death, Harkoi was deeply grieved.
A nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he had gone far away from active politics for the last 10 years.
The kind of affection, devotion and grief that emerged throughout the country for Atal ji demonstrates his great personality.
For the past several days, Atal ji's best aspect has come to the fore.
India will always be attached to Atal ji for the Third Amendment Act, 2003.
These changes brought about two important changes in India's politics.
First, the length of the Cabinet in the States was restricted to 15 of the Assembly Constituency.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Anti Parties Act was increased from one third to two thirds.
Further, clear guidelines have also been set for declaring the unfair to the participants.
For many years, the political culture of making big cabinets in India was built not for sharing of work but to make politicians happy.
Atal ji changed this culture.
These steps have saved money and resources.
It also increased efficiency.
Atal ji was such a visionary who changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from five o'clock in the evening to 11 o'clock in the morning.
In this way, he brought our beloved Tricolour closer to the people.
I would certainly say that it is an excellent tribute to Atal ji that for a healthy democracy, for a better democracy, for a better democracy, and for consistent efforts to strengthen democracy and for open discussion.
Just a few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament was concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 4.
And as a result, 21 Bills and 14 Bills were passed by the Lok Sabha in this Session.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a Session of Social Justice and Youth Welfare.
Several important bills that benefit the youth and the backward classes were passed in this session.
You all are aware that for decades there has been a demand for setting up an OBC Commission similar to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled its pledge to form OBC Commission this time.
Amendment Bill has also been made to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further safeguard the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent the perpetrators from committing aggression against the people of this class and will irrigate faith in the Dalit communities.
No member society can tolerate any injustice against the country's women power.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill seeking severe punishment for such offenders and the perpetrators of misdeeds will be punished for at least ten years.
Those who are below the age of twelve years of age will be punished with penalties.
It may have been read in the newspapers a few days ago that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, has to pass the hearing in just two months and punish two criminals of Kurma on one cigar.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the offenders to death after just five days of hearing.
In Rajasthan too, the courts there have given similar compensation.
The Act will play an effective role in curbing the offences against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time, in the fourth session, everyone has presented an ideal together.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, today millions of Indians are focused on the Asian Games played in Jakarta.
Waking up every morning, people first watch the newspapers, TV, news, social media and see that an Indian sportsperson has won a medal.
Asian Games are still underway.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to the sportspersons whose competitions are yet to be held.
Indias sportspersons are particularly outstanding in mathematics and wrestling but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in such sports as we have never seen before, such as sports like boys and girls.
This is not just a medal, but a legendary achievement of Indian sports and sportspersons' skies.
The rising number of medal winners for the country is a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the young medal winners, we are budding youth of the age group of 15-16 years.
It is also a very good sign that most of the sportspersons who have won medals are living in small towns and villages and these sportspersons have achieved this success with hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts and also pay my homage to Shri Dhyan Chand ji, the great hockey player.
I urge all the citizens of the country to take care of their sports and their rivalry because a healthy India will create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Only if India is healthy will India create a bright future.
Namaste Bhavnaji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen the construction of houses and buildings with bricks and stones but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain, which was full of stone, was given the shape of an excellent grand temple, perhaps it was difficult to imagine but it was possible.
And that is the temple - the Kailasnath Temple in Ellora, Maharashtra. If anyone tells you that a pillar of granite has been constructed more than 60 metres a thousand years ago and a rock of 80 tons of granite has been laid on its peak.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable mix of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Harkoi is surprised to see the footsteps of the 11th century queen in the Patan of Gujarat.
India has been a Bhumi Engineering Laboratory.
There have been many engineers in India who made imagination and presented examples of miracles in the world of engineering.
In our legacy of great engineers, we have also got such a gem whose work is still fascinating people.
M.
He is revered in that part of the country but the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In his memory, September 15th is celebrated as Engineers Day.
The engineers of our country have made their mark in the entire world by walking on their footprints.
When I talk of miracles in the world of engineering, I remember one incident of the terrible earthquake that hit Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to visit one village and I got the opportunity to meet a woman above 100 years of age.
They looked at me and were flying our joke and said, Look at this house.
In Kutch it is called Bhungo .
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes in my house.
But you will not get to see any harm.
This house was built by our ancestors according to the natural conditions of this place.
And he was saying this thing with pride that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created it according to the local conditions due to which ordinary people were safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be held at different places.
Do we have to learn some new things in a changed age
You have to learn
Will you have to connect
What should the students be taught
How to make ero Waste our priority
We must think of many such things when we celebrate Engineers Day.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And the preparations for Diwali also begin.
With this feeling, best wishes to everyone.
Thank you, I will meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So in some places people are still waiting for the rains.
India's vastness and diversity sometimes shows a dislike for the rains.
But what do we do to the rain
It is man who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and the result is that sometimes nature blames us.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave and get out of it.
But on that day, the mishap was only another approval.
When they had gone a good distance inside the cave, suddenly due to heavy rains, such water was collected near the entrance to the cave.
Their exit route was blocked.
Due to lack of roads, all of them got stuck on a small cliff inside the cave.
And that too will not be a day or two for 18 days.
On one hand, he was facing difficulties.
On the other hand, humanity from all over the world was united and demonstrated the human qualities that God had demonstrated.
People from all over the world were praying to take these children out safely.
The sense of responsibility at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, the members of their families, the media or the citizens of the country, everyone has shown a wonderful way of peace and patience.
Everyone was associated with their mission by becoming a team.
I believe that everybody has a controlled behaviour which is a learning subject and understanding.
Its not like that the parents are not sad, it is not that the tears of the mothers' eyes are not visible, but the patience and restraint of the entire society is a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity becomes a wealth, wonders become a thing.
A few days ago, the favourite poet of our country, Neeraj ji, had bid farewell to us.
We can give a lot of strength to the Indians too, every single thing of Neeraj ji can give a lot of inspiration.
Our school board had talked about the stress and maturity of the exam while examining the examination and now your message is for students like me.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the same time when a college has a very busy time.
Lakhs of youngsters like Satyam come out of school and enter the college.
If we go to the exams, papers and norths in February and March, then in the months of April and May, the result is spent on enjoying holidays as well as ensuring better ways of life, selecting a career etc.
The focus of the students is limited to the school by eliminating them from home.
Students come from the umbrella of their parents to the umbrella of professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the start of the college life.
For the first time we have to leave the village and get out of a protective environment and make ourselves friends.
All these youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time and leave their lives in a new direction.
I would like to tell you all to remain calm, obey your life and enjoy yourself in life.
Learn something new, like new skills, learn new languages.
He has already achieved success in the MBBS test of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father nourishes the waste of his family.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who come from poor families and despite their opposite needs, have shown us something from their hard work and dedication that inspires us all.
Whether it is Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta from Kolkata, who has studied on footpath by sitting below the street light, or by his father, Daughter of Ahmedabad, Afrin Shaikh, who runs autorickshaws.
Or, the Divyang Dikri Anushka Panda of Gurgaon, who is suffering from a hereditary disorder called Spine Muscular Atrophy since birth.
All of them have achieved success in the entire world by eliminating all obstacles with their determination and courage.
If we look around, we will also get some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country inspires me.
And when I tell you the story of these youngsters then I recall the story of poet Neeraj ji and this is the purpose of life.
There was something like this. Once I was interacting with two Indian youth in San Jose city of America, known as the technology hub.
I had appealed to them to think about how they can harness their talent for India and do something out of time.
I called upon Brain Drine to turn him into Brain Gain.
Both the IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji embraced this challenge and made an innovative effort.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have collaborated with their professional skills to create a smart village app.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can get information on their mobile phones.
These residents of Taudhakpur village of Rai Bareli, Sarpanch, District Magistrate, Taluka Development Officer, all of them sensitized the people for the use of this App.
Now it has become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development work being done in the village by recording it through this App.
The App consists of the village phone directory, news department, topic list, health centre and wellness centre.
The grammar features of the app, the faculty rates among the farmers, in a way, work as a market for their produce.
If you look closely at this incident then one thing will come to the fore that the people of America who had lost their lives in the midst of their life in the midst of their lifestyle and conduct, those youngsters who had quit India many years ago, are also aware of the nuances of their villages, the challenges and the emotions associated with the village.
This is the reason why perhaps the village can be properly constructed as per the requirement of the village.
This feeling of attachment to one's village, one's roots and doing something for one's life is naturally embedded in every Indian.
However, sometimes due to some distinction, sometimes due to some situations, a thin dust gets stuck on it, but if they get touched with some kind of irritation then good things emerge again.
Pandharpur Vari is indeed a wonderful journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was celebrated on 23rd July, is celebrated as the grand festival of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Almost 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi, pilgrims travel to Pandharpur along with Palikhi.
Lakhs of workers are connected to this journey called 'Vari'.
The footsteps of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are kept in Palakhi and Vithal.
Pilgrims are also called Lord Vithal or Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the deprived.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are somewhat immense devotional.
There is a different experience of visiting the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and the beauty and spiritual joy of that place.
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Bari once you get the opportunity.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdeo, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still educating the individuals in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstition.
Whether it is his strength or disgust, we receive from him a message of goodwill, love and brotherhood.
There is a mantra that society can fight against superstition.
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed the tokyo and the rituals and ensured that the old rituals were eradicated from our society and irrigated the values of compassion, equality and devotion to the people.
We remember Tilak ji on his Jayanti on 23rd July and his death anniversary on first August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intellect to demonstrate to the British administrators the essence of their mistakes.
They were so scared of the British Lokmanya Tilak that they tried to impose sedition on him thrice in 20 years and it was no small matter.
Today, I would like to place before my countrymen an incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 116, more than 40 thousand people welcomed him in Ahmedabad, 100 years ago.
And during this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed by Lokmanya Tilak ji. And when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 1, 120, he decided that he would make Tilak ji's memorial in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb was inaugurated by the Khood Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February 12th.
And I am talking about the time of this British period.
The tradition of Ganesh Utsav started because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The Ganesh Utsav has become an effective medium for traditional devotion and joy, as well as for furthering the spirit of social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
In such a scenario, there was a time when the country was an asset for the fight against the British. These festivals broke the barriers of caste and sect and made a wealth for everyone.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
This shows that what kind of craze this is for our younger generation, for the brave leaders of our ancient heritage and history.
Today, in many cities you get to see the Ganesh pothole in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also requested last time and today when I am reminding Lokmanya Tilak ji, I once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav, celebrate Dhamma, celebrate it with full force but I urge you to celebrate the Eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav.
And I would say that the eco-friendly Ganesh Festival should be placed on Maya Gov and on the Narendra Modi App for wide publicity.
I will definitely reach out to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak possessed self-confidence among the countrymen and he had promised that Swaraj is our birthright and we will cherish it with it even today.
'Swaraj is our birth right and we will gain it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandra Shekhar ji inspired many youngsters for the bravery and freedom of freedom.
Freedom left his life on the horizon but he did not bow to foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Chandrashekhar Azad village in Madhya Pradesh to Alirajpur.
Once again, I salute Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji, the two great sons of Mother India.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Das won the Golden chandra in the 400m race at the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland.
In response to a threat of further unity in the country, I have e-mailed it from Indonesia that it is now preparing for Asian Games.
The name of the country has been enhanced.
In Tunisia, the World Para Athletics Grand Pre 2018 won the Gold and Bronze medal.
Their achievement is special because they have made their own challenges a medium of their actions.
The road accident in 2003 has resulted in the loss of half of the body of Dairy Ekta Bhayana, but this daughter has not lost courage and has achieved this after strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathuniaji has also conquered the Golden uadrilateral by winning the Golden uadrilateral at the Para Athletics Grand Primary in Berlin and Sundar Singh Gurjar also won the Golden uadrilateral in Bhalafenk.
My dear countrymen, many events and festivals of the history of the month of August are filled with festivals but sometimes diseases also enter home due to weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the good health, for the month of August and for the centuries-long festivals that inspire you all for the good health and patriotism.
Once again I will definitely get Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
A historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru just a few days ago.
You people must have understood a lot that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two teams performed well in this match and also performed well in the IPL this year along with other bolor Rashid Khan from Afghanistan. And I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is an asset of cricket world and he also wrote in a jokeful style whether we should give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
It is very natural to remember that this was the first match, but I will be remembered for some special reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world.
What can a winner team do while taking trophy, he added.
While taking the Indian team trophy, the Afghanistan team, which was playing international matches for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and photographed with both the teams.
We can experience what is a sportsman spirit, what is a sportsmanship.
Sports is a very good way to unite the society and to discover the talent that our youth has among them.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that in the same way we will play with each other, with the entire sportsman spirit as well.
My dear countrymen, on this 21st June, we had a different look at Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the Europian Parliament in Brussels or the United Nations Headquarters in New York or the Japanese Naval Warships, people were seen performing Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, Yoga was a historic event and I was told that women had demonstrated several asanas.
Soldiers from India and China simultaneously performed Yoga on the high Barfila peaks of Ladakh.
Yoga breaks all boundaries and connects them.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries made this occasion a big festival by going beyond caste, religion, region, colour or sex.
If people from all over the world were participating in Yoga Day programmes with such enthusiasm, why wouldn't the enthusiasm of India be multiplied
The country is proud when 1. 25 billion people see that the security forces of our country have practiced Yoga at all the three locations of the Navy, Army and Air Force.
While some brave soldiers performed Yoga in Sabarmari, some soldiers performed Yoga at the snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force, in the midst of the sky, performed Yogasanas at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth, to make everyone surprising.
The view was that they did yoga in air rather than sitting in the plane.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A scene in Ahmedabad was heart touching.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters had established a world record by practicing Yoga together at one place.
I believe that today's event is working as a wellness and revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from yoga will move forward.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
Several people wrote to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that I had spoken about the Dr.
We remember the doctor in times of crisis but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them very much for their service and dedication towards society.
We are those people who worship Mother in the form of Goddess and believe that Goddess is right because Mother gives us life.
Mother gives birth to us, sometimes doctors give us birth.
The role of the doctor is not limited to merely treating diseases.
Today the doctors not only have a medical experiment but also have a lot of experience in terms of the impact it has on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark across the world with their capabilities and skills.
In Medical Profession, along with hardworking, our doctors are also known for solving complex medicinal problems.
As Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all our doctors friends on behalf of each and every citizen of India on behalf of Dr.
My dear countrymen, we are such lucky people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a rich history when there will be no such month, there will not be a day in which no historical event has occurred.
You see, every place in India has its own heritage.
There are some saints, some great men, some famous person, everybody has their own contribution, it is their own glory.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am visiting Maghar on 28th. And whenever I was in Gujarat, you would be aware of the Kabirvad of Gujarat.
When I was working there, I had a very big national meeting of the people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had visited Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who died in Maghar did not go to heaven.
The person who sacrifices his body in Kashi goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered unholy but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same evils and superstitions of his times and hence he went to Maghar and finished it.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his compassion and guidance.
He was his ideal.
We see the same ideals in their creations and it is the same inspiration in todays era.
One of his companions is: Kabir Soai Pir Hai, if Jaane Peer Peer Johanneh Peer Peer Johanneh, So Ka Peer Me Peer means Peer Sant is the one who knows and understands the sufferings of the other, who does not know the pain of the other.
Kabirdas ji had a special emphasis on social harmony.
He used to think a lot ahead of his time.
He gave a message of peace and goodwill to the world when there was a time of conflict and struggle and worked to eradicate discrimination among the people.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that service to the poor and needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he made several initiatives for the betterment of the society.
This anchor system was started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, where every caste, sect, religion or sect can come and eat.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to associate with it with zeal and enthusiasm.
I urge you people to think and prepare ourselves on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and on how to celebrate it throughout the society and across the world, what kind of new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new imaginations should be. And with great pride, let us make this light festival an inspiration.
The struggle for India's independence is very long, very extensive, it is full of innumerable martyrs.
There is a history associated with Punjab.
The year 2017 also marked 100 years of the Jallianwala Bagh horrific incident, which was shamefully embarrassed by humanity.
Who can forget the dark day of April 13, 11, when he used to misuse the power, crossed all limits of cruelty and fired bullets on innocent, unarmed and innocent people.
Victory is always a matter of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee on his Birth Anniversary and wished that Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the President of the Republic of India, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 3, 2018).
Ramanji, first of all, thank you very much.
It was very good to see your Ruchi in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several fields but the areas which were closest to him were education, administrations and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would know that he was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the Calcutta University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Minister of Industries in India and in one sense he laid a strong foundation stone for India's industrial development, laid a strong base and created a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of Independent India, 1948, was marked by his ideas and vision.
Mukherjees dream was that India should be industrially self-sufficient, skillful and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries and also focus on MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were set up between 1948 and 150 for better development of cottage and small scale industries.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee contributed a lot.
He was dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
It is the result of their understanding, wisdom and activism that a part of Bengal can be saved and today it is a part of India.
Dr.
Remembering the message of the unity of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, let us remain connected with the feelings of goodwill and brotherhood for Indias progress.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video call.
I got the opportunity to learn directly from them about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people moving beyond the files.
People spoke of their resolutions, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements.
Daughters in remote villages have been providing services ranging from pension to passports for the elderly of the village through Common Service Centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh combines ice cream and does business .
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras as well as providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
There would not be any corner of the country where people did not talk about their success.
In such an environment, when the common man comes up with new hopes, new zeal and events in his life then he is not the head of the government.
Even a small child in a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology, through video bridge, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries has been extremely pleasant and inspiring. It not only gives me satisfaction but it also gives me the opportunity to do more work.
A new joy of living for the poorest of the poor person, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined the video bridge programme and you have given me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to you all.
I always feel that if we look around us then something is good somewhere or the other.
There are people who do good.
We can also feel the aroma of goodness.
In the last few days, one thing has come to my mind and it is a unique combination.
While on the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters engaged in farming.
Now you would be wondering what is the relation between these two professions
But it is such that they have come together with corporate professionals and IT engineers in Bengaluru, they have formed a simple prosperity trust and they have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Joining the farmers and making arrangements and making successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through trust and making good prices.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have an important role in the entire sugarcane from crop production to marketing while on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the farmers' participation in profits.
I express my gratitude to these youngsters for this innovative experiment. And I am glad that these youngsters from the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their boundaries and have taken the path of connecting with the farmers, connecting with the villages and joining the fields.
Once again, I would have known the innovative experiments of my country to the younger generation, maybe I knew something, maybe some people might be aware, some might not be aware but millions and millions of people are doing something good.
GST is going to be completed one year.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country, today it has turned into reality.
On Nation, One Tax Reform, if I want to get the maximum credit for this thing then I would like to give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took decisions in the country and then such a huge tax reform was implemented in the country.
Till now 2 meetings of GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that people of different political ideologies sit there, people of different states sit, state governments with different proprieties but all the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken with consensus.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country prior to the GST but now only one tax has been levied across the country.
GST is a victory of honesty and a festival of honesty.
Earlier, there used to be complaints of Inspector Raj in tax matters in the country.
With the introduction of GST, the check post was closed and the movement of goods was speeded up which not only saved time but also benefitted the Logistics sector.
The GST will probably be the worlds largest tax reform.
Such a huge tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured by the people of the country.
It is generally believed that it takes 5 to 5 years for such a large number of people to be fully stable. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the country's integrity is the result of Jan Shakti's participation that within a year this new tax system has made its place, it has achieved stability and it keeps improving its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
25 billion Indians have dedicated this great success in itself.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for Mann Ki Baat to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
Through Mann Ki Baat, I have once again got the opportunity to be present before you.
You people would remember that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama ji, I would like to talk a few things about it.
These six daughters of India and their team travelled through the sea for more than fourty-four days and returned to India on 21st May and were warmly welcomed by the entire nation.
He travelled across various oceans and seas, cutting across twenty-two thousand nautical miles.
This was the first such incident in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and hear their experiences.
If we look at the development journey of the human race then progress has emerged from the clutches of adventure.
You must have seen in the past that some new things have been noticed about those who hit Mount Everest. For centuries Everest has been challenging the human race and brave people have been adapting to that challenge.
On May 16, a group of our tribal children - Manisha Dhurve, Mahesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katode, Vikas Soyam - climbed the highest peak in the world.
I heartily congratulate the people of Chandrapur school, my small friends and all of you.
Currently, the 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to serve Everest from Nepal.
Many congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest became the first Indian father-son to sir.
Its not like that only the youth are fighting the Everest.
Sangeeta Bahele kicked the Everest on 1st May and Sangeeta Bahal is over 50 years of age.
There are some people who demonstrate that they not only have skills but also are sensitive.
People have been fighting Everest for years and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these entrepreneurs, especially the daughters and daughters from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, when I talked about Fit India just two months ago, I didn't think that it would have such a good impact.
Such a large number of people from all walks of life will come forward in their support.
When I talk about 'Fit India', I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
People are sharing videos of fitness challenges on social media, targeting each other and charging them.
Today, everybody is joining this movement of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world, the common man of the country, the soldiers of the army, the school teachers, there is a single voice all around - Hum Fit to India Fit.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that I too have been challenged by the Indian Cricket Team, Virat Kohli and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and such a challenge will encourage us to keep fit and others fit.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that were once a part of every child's life, everywhere, every child's life is being lost today.
These games were particularly a part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
It is also outside the house and also inside the house.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games as well.
The same game is known by different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know there is a game in Gujarat.
It is played with code or tamarind seed or passage and with a square board of 8x8.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Who among us would be the one who did not play Moi Dandiya in childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) plays games ranging from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi while in Maharashtra it is called Vittidalu .
Some sportspersons had their own season.
Like kite chewing also has a season.
When all kites fly, when we play, we can express Muktam the unique qualities that we have in us.
You must have seen that many children are of shameful nature but they are extremely comfortable while playing.
They express themselves, the big ones who are seen to be serious, the ones hidden in them come out while playing.
Traditional sports is something that enhances our physical capacity as well as our rational thinking, concentration, alertness and vigilance.
From kids to grandparents, little ones, whenever they play the game, then what is called the pellet or the generation gap, they get tossed somewhere.
Many sports also awaken us about society, environment etc.
Today it is imperative that schools, stakeholders, youth groups etc. will come forward to promote these games.
We can make a huge architecture of our traditional sports by crowd sourcing.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, our country will officially host the World Environment Day celebrations.
It is an important achievement for India and is also acknowledging Indias growing leadership in the world towards climate change mitigation.
This is the theme of Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wildlife and on our health.
Visit the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them down in your daily life.
When there is scorching heat, floods, rain does not take the name of stopping rains, when it gets cold then every person becomes an expert and talks about Global Warming, Climate Change.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that in different parts of the country there was dust storm, heavy winds and rains as well.
There was a loss of life and a loss of lives.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in weather surroundings.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi acknowledged this as a result of his life-long departure.
When India played a pivotal role in the Cop21 and the Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the medium of international solar alliance, it was in all its roots that Mahatma Gandhi's dream was realized.
On this environment day, let us all think about whether we can do anything to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
Monsoon is about to come, this time we can aim for record tree plantation and not only planting trees but also maintaining them till it grows.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
Now you remember the 21st June, not only us but the entire world remembers 21st June.
21st June is celebrated as International Yoga Day for the entire world and it has been accepted and people begin preparations months ago.
Nowadays, there are reports that all over the world, preparations are underway to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Youg for unity and harmonious society are a message that the world has experienced over the past few years.
Yoga creates courage that protects us like a father who is a father.
A feeling of forgiveness arises like a mother for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartuhari has said that by doing Yoga regularly, the truth becomes our son, our sister, our self-respectful brother, our land, our bed and knowledge become our hungry destination.
When all these qualities become a companion of somebody, Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge my countrymen to further the legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 2nd May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
The memory of this month of May is also linked to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of May 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers demonstrated their bravery and were committed against injustice.
The sad fact is that for a long time, we have been calling the events of 1985 as mere rebellion or sepoy rebellion.
In fact, it was an attempt to push our self-respect.
He was Veer Savarkar, who had dedicatedly written that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but a first war of independence.
Savarkar and the brave hearts of the India House of London celebrated its 50th anniversary with fervor.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month in the first month of Independence.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of characteristics
He was a prophet of both weapons and scriptures.
Generally, Veer Savarkar is known for his struggle against his valour and the British Raj, but apart from all, he was also a bright poet and social reformer, who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
An amazing description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had done so accurately.
Savarkar carried both poetry and revolution.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were once forced to ask for garbage from the households, are learning the work of sewing and wearing clothes to cover the poor.
I wish these daughters a bright future filled with hope and confidence.
He has shown that if you are determined to do something and you are committed to it then success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties.
And that is not just a matter of Sikar but you will get to see this thing in every corner of India.
If you look at your neighbourhood then it will be noticed that how people defeat problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, we also have discussions and discussions with some of the people associated with it.
These discussions are of politics, of society, of movies, of sports, of sports and athletes, of the country's problems and of this kind of problem. However, most of these things are limited to discussions only but there are some people who move forward in the direction of bringing about a change with their hard work and commitment.
Shri D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that the sellers of a precious tea have been impressing education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He also opened a school called Asha Aswasan for children living in huts, where poor tea sellers spend 50 of their income on it.
It provides education, health and food to all the school going children.
I am D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his commitment and for giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
He has eradicated the darkness of his life.
Who doesn't know the word 'Natso Ma Jyotiragamay' but has shown it to be alive.
Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and for the entire nation.
There will be a series of such inspiring incidents around you too.
There will be countless incidents.
Let us take positivity forward.
In the month of June, there is so much heat that people wait for the rains and in the hope of looking at the clouds in the sky.
A few days from today, people will also wait for the moon.
Looking at the moon means that Eid can be celebrated.
The festival of Eid marks the beginning of celebration after one month of fasting during Ramzan.
I am confident that everyone will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm and specially children will get a good Idi on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
19 countries of the world including India participated in it.
Whenever there is such a grand event, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating in it, can imagine what kind of atmosphere would there be
Who can keep it apart from himself when there is an atmosphere of enthusiasm, emotions, enthusiasm, hopes, aspirations and aspirations.
Our sportspersons also performed well in the hopes of the countrymen and won one medal after another.
Whether it is Shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has performed a record.
26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze - almost 66 medals won by India.
This success brings pride to every Indian.
Winning a medal is a matter of pride and happiness for athletes.
It is a festival of great pride for the entire nation and for all its citizens.
Perhaps even the words will come down to me to express this feeling.
But I would like to tell you what I heard from these players.
It means this time there were a lot of things that happened for the first time.
Do you know that the number of wrestlers who were from India in the Commonwealth Games this time has won all the medals
Manika Batra won medals in all the events she participated in.
She is the first Indian woman to win Indias Gold in the Individual Table Tennis.
India has received the highest number of medals shooting.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian Para Power-lifter to win medals in the Commonwealth Games.
The games were special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squosh or be it boxing or be it weightlifting or be it shooting, women sportspersons have done wonders.
In Badminton, two Indian players, Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
Sindhu.
The athletes who participated in the games came from different parts of the country and from smaller towns.
His friends have also contributed to maintaining their courage in every situation.
I congratulate all those players and convey my best wishes to them.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India. And I have invited everyone to join Fit India and take the lead in Fit India.
A gentleman, Mr. Shashikant Bhonsle, has written in a swimming pool share one of his photographs - My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel myself happy and healthy with the Morning walk.
And he further says: "For me - Fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that there is a feeling of happiness.
Actor Akshay Kumar has put a video on Twitter.
Several other youngsters have also shared their experiences by connecting with Fitt India Efforts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
The glory of the 21st June International Yoga Day has now been accepted by the whole world.
You should also prepare from now on.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been told is getting very popular.
My young friends, now you have come out of the midst of exams, exams and exams and have started worrying about vacations.
How to celebrate holidays, where to go.
Outside the four walls, one gets an opportunity to live a new life by living away from computers with paper-columns.
My young friends, I urge you today for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, HRD or Drinking Water Department, have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
The students of the college, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youngsters of Nehru Yuva Kendra, who want to do something for the society, for the country, for the society, for the society, for those who want to associate themselves with the change, for those who want to add something to the society, for those who want to associate themselves with the society, for those who have a positive energy and a desire to do something or the other in the society, this is an opportunity for everyone and it will also strengthen the cleanliness. And before we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will get the satisfaction to do something.
Every intern who successfully completes this internship will be given a certificate through the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only this, the internet that will complete it very well, the UGC will also provide two credit points to them.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of it for internship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by visiting MyGov App.
I hope that our youth will further this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your gentlemen, send stories, send photos, send videos.
Let us make this holiday an opportunity to learn for a new experience.
I have seen in the past that Delhi has been talking about the youngsters who have been selflessly engaged in the education of poor children.
Starting from 15 kids in huts near Gita Colo in Delhi, today 2,000 children have been connected to 12 locations in the capital.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this campaign have taken out a free time of 2 hours from their busy schedule and are engaged in this drive of social transformation.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand's mountainous region have become a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
His collective efforts not only changed the fortune of his own but also of his own sector.
Ragi, Rajgara, Makai or Java are mainly grown in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Being a hilly area, the farmers cannot get the right value.
However, the farmers of Kapkot taluka, instead of directly selling the crops in the market, adopted the path of value addition and adopted the path of value addition.
What they did - they started making biscuits from the same sports produce and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative organisation in Munnar village and started a biscuit factory there.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now being transported not only to about fifty Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kathgodam.
With the hard work of the farmers, the institution has reached an annual turnover of 10-15 lakhs, but at the same time, more than 700 families have been left out of the district due to employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be a war on water in the world in future.
Everyone talks about it but is it our responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown them to live for centuries.
He gave priority to the glory of one drop of water.
He has discovered new ways to save one drop of water.
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where they have been written in the temples for irrigation, water conservation and drought management.
You will get to see big inscriptions everywhere be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilapatti or Puddukottai.
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely get Chand Bawa in Jodhpur .
It is one of the biggest and most beautiful valleys of India and the point of attention is that it is in an area where there is a shortage of water.
April, May, June and July are such times that there is an excellent opportunity to store rain water and if we prepare in the advance itself then we get as much benefits as we do.
The MNREGA budget is also useful for water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has strived in the direction of water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent every year on water conservation and water management separately from the MGNREGA budget.
In 2017-18, I have spent 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64 thousand crore, i. e.
Over the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through water conservation and water management measures.
The MNREGA budget provided by the Government of India for water conservation and water management has benefitted a lot of people.
Thousands of MNREGA workers worked hard on the river Kuttumperur in Kerala and revived the river after working hard for 70 days.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-rich rivers but there are also some areas in Uttar Pradesh like Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district.
The district system has taken up a large number of works under MGNREGA for soil and water conservation.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, this Sasar Khadri river, which had dried up, has been revived.
Be it animals, birds, farmers, farming, villages or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it animals or be it a farmer or be it a village or be it a village or be it a blessed person or be it a success or be it the success of this success.
I would say that once again April, May, June and July are before us. We should also take any responsibility for water conservation and water conservation.
When there is Mann Ki Baat then messages come from all sides, newspapers and phones come to me.
We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the philosophy of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who lived with peacefully, beauty and integrity.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, discuss this topic so that people can know about it.
I thank Ayyanji for attracting the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was full of wisdom and wisdom, which left his indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a brilliant personality, a multi-faceted personality, but at every moment a teacher can experience it.
He wrote in Geetanjali: He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.
I don't know the Bengali language, but when I was young, I used to get up very early - from childhood and from East India's radio starts soon.
When a delay starts in western India then I guess that Rabindra Sangeet was started at 5:30 in the morning, radio and I was habituated to it.
I didn't know the language. I got used to listening to Rabindra Sangeet on the radio early in the morning. And when I got the opportunity to hear those poems of Anandlok and Aguner, Porushmoni, I got a consciousness.
You must have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet.
I salute Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated all over the world with full devotion and respect.
The social aspect of rose is that when a person is very hungry he also feels the hunger of another person.
He feels the thirst of others when he is thirsty.
This is an occasion to recall the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammad Sahib.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood in their lives.
Once a person asked Paigambar Sahib, what is the best work in Islam
Paigambar Saheb said - Feeding a poor and needy person and meeting with everyone in a good manner, whether you know or not.
Pyambar Sahib believed in knowledge and compassion.
They were not proud of anything.
He used to say that ego defeats knowledge.
Paigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have any thing more than necessary then you give it to a needy person and donation in Ramzan is also very important.
People donate to the needy people in this holy month.
Paigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is immersed in purity with his soul and not with money.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcases the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people across the world.
This Buddha Purnima, remembers Lord Buddha, strives to follow his path, makes a solemn pledge and reminds us of the responsibility of all of us.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, goodwill and brotherhood.
These are the human values that are the most needed in todays world.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar emphasised that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb empowered crores of people who were oppressed, persecuted, deprived, marginalised through the Constitution.
There cannot be a greater example of compassion.
This compassion for the suffering of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries, who took with them the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha and lived with them all the time.
Throughout Asia, we have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha.
It connects us with many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and the teachings of Buddha. And that is why we are developing a framework for Buddhist tourism that connects important places of South-East Asia to India's special Buddhist sites.
I am also happy to note that the Government of India is participating in the revival of many Buddhist temples, including the centuries old magnificent Ananda Temple in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is striving and human suffering and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the path to eradicate hatred by compassion.
I wish Buddha Purnima the very best to all those who are devoted to Lord Buddha and those who believe in the principles of compassion.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can take our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we recall Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, which is said to be that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that Smilling Buddha is also associated with an important event of Indias defence history.
You would be wondering what is the relationship between Smilling Buddha and India's military power
You may recall that 20 years ago on the evening of 11th May 18, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji addressed the nation and his words filled the nation with pride, valour and happiness.
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 18th, a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan, on the west side of India.
Indias testing was successful and in a way, India exhibited its strengths in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as an exhibition of its military strength in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that the power of inner strength, the power of inner self is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you are strong in the form of a nation, you can remain peaceful with all of you.
The month of May, 1988 is not only important for the country but it is important that the nuclear test was conducted in this month.
It demonstrated to the world that Indias land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra - Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
We can also get a new pleasure and a new satisfaction to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started while looking at.
My dear countrymen, I will talk more when I meet in Mann Ki Baat again.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen the power of Ram Naam in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life.
Recently, on 26th January, when all the dignitaries from ASEAN countries were present here, they had brought a cultural troop with them. And it is a matter of pride that most of these countries were presenting before us the Ramayana.
It means that Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have received a large number of letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar ji wrote on MyGov about the introduction of Sanskrit online course.
Besides being an IT professional, it was very good to see your love for culture.
I have asked the concerned department to provide you with information about the efforts being made in this regard.
I would also urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat who works on the Sanskrit context to consider what could be done in the context of Comal ji's suggestions.
Mr. Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barak, District Nalanda, Bihar, you read the comments written on the NarendraModiApp.
The concern you have expressed at the declining water level in the ground is very important.
Shrimanapal Shastri ji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals during summers.
Kal ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadrasha ji, he says that this time I will talk to the youth about his health.
They feel that our youth is physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we should talk to everyone in detail about health - Fit India.
And all of you can collectively run the Fit India movement.
In the last few days, the French President had visited Kashi and Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the visions of this journey were touching and affecting the heart.
And he urged all the photographs, all video and social media to be published.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put those pictures on social media and NarendraModiApp the same day.
Now you lick them and retweet them, make them reach your friends.
He has written to me the ideas he has given in his heart about the Gratitude Cards that have been given behind the Exam Warrior book from Chennai.
Anagha, Jayesh, I would like to tell all the children that your letters exhaust my day-long fatigue.
All these letters, all the phone calls, all the comments that I could read, all the things that I could hear and there are so many things that touched my mind that I would have to say something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about the examination.
He mentioned his plans for vacations.
Water is a concern for animals during summers.
Farmer brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities related to Kisan Melas and farming across the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed during the festivals.
That is, our thoughts also change with the seasons. And perhaps it is also true that the thoughts of our mind change the season of somebody's life.
And why not
There is so much inspiration, so much energy and so much intimacy in these things, in your experiences and in your examples that there is a need to do something for the country.
It has the power to change the weather throughout the country.
When I read in your letters how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, has built new schools for the poor children due to his will power, then this country's immense will power is visible.
Saddle in his mission collected money from household sellers and donors.
Many travellers in their cabs donated generously.
An engineer girl gave her first salary
Thus, after 12 years of collection of money, Saddle Laskar brought the colour that he had made and today due to his hard work and determination, due to his determination, a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds is being constructed in Punari village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, India's vision has changed across the world.
Today, there is a belief in the youth, women, the backward, the poor, the middle class and in every section of the country that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
A positive environment of self-confidence filled with hope and aspirations has been created.
This self-confidence, this positive New India will fulfil our resolutions and dreams.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are extremely important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have come to agriculture.
This time I have also watched the video of the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and I feel that every farmer should connect with the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and should apply the experiments in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastriji, Lohiaji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers an important part of the country's economy and common man's life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji stressed on the need for conservation of plants, trees and plants and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of a massive public awareness on the basis of good income for our farmers, good irrigation facilities and ensuring food and milk production.
In his 1997 speech, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji emphasized the need for farmers to use new technology and innovate.
I had visited the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi last days.
My interaction with the farmer brothers and sisters and scientists there, knowing and understanding a lot of experiences related to agriculture, knowing about innovation related to agriculture was a pleasant experience for me, but the hard work of the farmers of Meghalaya and the region that impressed me the most.
This small state has been demonstrated in a big way.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have made record production over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has demonstrated that when the goal is determined, when there is a determination and resolve in the mind, it can be achieved.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is getting the support of technology, which is giving a lot of strength to the agricultural produce.
In the letters that have come to me, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the price of support and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a major decision has been taken to provide the farmers the right price for their crops.
It has been decided that the price of support for notified crops will be announced at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the villages with the wholesley market and then with the global market.
Farmers will not have to go far to sell their produce. For this, 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded with the necessary interfaces and connected with APMC and e-NAM platform.
That is, in a way, a system is being created for direct connectivity of any market in the country with the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the start of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is not only our resolve but also our resolve, how can we pay our best tributes to Gandhi Ji by taking the best wishes of 1. 25 billion Indians
How can new activities be respected for this
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
Please inform you about the slogan or the mantra or the word Ghosh.
Together, we have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu. Remembering Bapu, we have to take our country to new heights by taking inspiration from him.
Thank you, you have said the truth and I believe that Swachh Bharat and a healthy India complement each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a consistent approach in the field of health.
Earlier every work related to health in the country was only the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, when all the departments and ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Protection, Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments are working together for a healthy India and emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with preventive health.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive healthcare, the more it will benefit the individual, the family and the society.
Cleanliness is the first requirement for a healthy life.
We all have taken the initiative as a country and the result of this thing is that in the last 4 years, sanitary coverage has doubled to almost 80.
Besides, work is also being done at a massive level in the direction of setting up Health Wellness Centres across the country.
It is the result of our commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
Less than 100 days have been saved for this time International Yoga Day 21st June.
In the last three International Days of Yoga, people from all parts of the country and the world have participated with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone for Yoga from now on.
With new dimensions, Yoga has to be popularised in children, in the youth, in the elderly, in all age groups, be it men or women.
Although television and electronic media of the country are organising different programmes on Yoga during the year, can we create awareness about Yoga as a mission from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I am sure Yoga practitioner but some people have made me Yoga teacher through their creativity and made me a 3D animated video by doing Yoga.
I will share that video with all of you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are also being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that healthcare is accessible and affordable for the common man.
The cost of heart stents for heart patients has been reduced by up to 85.
The number of MBBS seats in the prevailing 4 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being set up in various states to provide better health care facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
We will see a collective endeavour to get rid of B.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For them, industry was an effective medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when Make in India campaign is progressing successfully in the country, Dr.
The vision of Ambedkar ji as an industrial super power is an inspiration for us today.
Today, India is emerging as a bright spot in the global economy and today FDI is the worlds largest FDI destination.
The entire world is seeing India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
The development of industries would be possible only in the cities.
Babasaheb Ambedkar reiterated Indias commitment to urbanization.
He did not want a person to live his life in poverty.
At the same time, he also believed that poverty cannot be eradicated by merely dividing the poor.
Today Mudra Yojana, Start up India, Stand up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
During the 1930s and 1940s when there was only talk of roads and railways in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways.
This is Dr.
Babasaheb had seen Jal Shakti as a nation power.
Emphasizing on the use of water for the development of the country, various River Valley Authorities, various Water Commissions were the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on various sea coasts of India and interfaces are being strengthened at old ports.
During the period of 1940, most of the discussions were held with regard to World War II, the cold war and partition, at that time Dr.
Ambedkar in a way laid the foundation stone of Team Indias spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working closely with the Centre and States for the upliftment of the nation.
Today, in every aspect of governance, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and beyond it, and the most important thing is that Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me belonging to the backward classes.
He has shown us that to move forward, it is not necessary that a large or rich family is born, but those born in the poor families of India can also dream, they can strive to fulfil their dreams and succeed.
Yes, it was also made that many people had visited Dr.
Every possible effort was made so that the daughters of the poor and the backward families could not move forward, nothing could be done, nothing could be achieved in their lives.
But the pictures of New India are quite different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor, to the backward.
Under this, various programmes will be organized across India on Rural Development, Poor Welfare and Social Justice.
I urge you to take active part in this mission.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals in the coming days - Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
The day marks the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, the day to remember his sacrifices and penance.
The life philosophy of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence will inspire us all.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
The discussions about Easter remind one of the inspiring teachings of Lord Isa Christ which have conveyed the message of peace, harmony, justice, kindness and compassion to the righteous humanity.
Punjab and West India will be celebrated as Vaisakhi festivals in April, the same day will be Judshital and Satuvin in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Polia Vaisakh in West Bengal.
All these festivals, in some way or the other, are associated with our farming farmers and food providers, and through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts we receive as produce.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
My dear countrymen, today Namaskar is starting Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and keep writing something about it.
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue but we know from our daily experiences that there is no color of water.
Have we ever wondered why rivers, seas and water become colorful
This question came to mind in the decade of the 120s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes before us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Excellent Work on Light Scattering.
One of his discoveries is known as Ramon Effect.
We celebrate National Science Day every year on 28th February as it is said that the incident of light skating was discovered this day for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta, while on the other hand, it is our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The famous particle Boson was also named after Satyendra Nath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai - the inauguration of Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the miracles that are taking place in the field of science.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy better.
In that programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help in improving the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can Artificial Intelligence help in making health services accessible and treating diseases in a modern way
A few days ago, along with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat to inaugurate the I Create in Ahmedabad.
A young man has developed such a digital instrument that if a person cannot speak, he can write his words through the instrument and he can communicate in the same way as a speaker speaks.
I understand that we can use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology values are neutral.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do the same thing as we want.
However, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Human inspiration becomes important here.
Use of science for the welfare of mankind is an experiment for attaining the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who invented the light bulb, failed many times in his experiments.
I am fortunate that today I am in Ocroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arabic.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised questions on their rule.
In this way, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
He searched for answers and waited for mankind.
The spirit of repeatedly asking questions is important to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my greetings to all our scientists, scientists and all those associated with science.
My best wishes to our younger generation to be inspired to discover truth and knowledge and to be inspired to serve society through science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages and people keep writing about all these topics during the time of crisis.
From Pune, Shri Rabindra Singh has spoken on the subject Occupational Safety in his comment on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that safety standards on factory and construction sites in our country are not so good.
On 4th March, Indias National Safety Day, the Prime Minister will address the Mann Ki Baat Programme on Safety, which will create awareness among the people.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one proactiveness and the other preparedness.
Safety is of two kinds - one that is required in time, safety during digestor and the other that is required in daily life, safety in availability.
If we are not aware of safety in day-to-day life, we cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to obtain it during exchanges.
We all read the boards written on the roads several times - cautions - accidents, accidents, destructions, miserable losses, pleasures and smiles - do not leave the world in the hurry, be safe from security, be it fun or life-style or cheaper, these words never use in our lives.
If we remain cautious and follow the required rules then we can save our lives, but we can also overcome the big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of letters are written about the safety of the workplace but whenever we want it cannot be complied with.
I urge the municipalities, municipalities who have fire brigades to go to different schools once a week or a month and drill them in front of school children.
There will be two benefits: Fire brigade will also be habituated to be cautious and the new generation will also get their teachings and there will be no expense for them. In a way, education remains a hierarchy.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the country in exchange.
Aapada Mitra has also been initiated to train volunteers in flood and cyclone risk districts.
Training and awareness have a big role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to the heat wave.
Thereafter, NDMA organized a workshop for prevention of heavywaves and launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
Everyones participation led to a good outcome.
The number of deaths due to robbery in 2017 has come down surprisingly to about 2020.
This shows that if we prioritize security, we can secure security.
There are countless people working like this in the society, be it social organisation or be it aware citizens. I would like to explain to all those who are engaged in relief and rescue work within minutes.
And the number of such unnamed heroes is no less.
(BIMSTEC) - A joint Disaster Management Exercise was also conducted in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, which was one of the first and largest human experiments in itself.
We have to become a Risk Concession Society.
In our culture, we always talk about protecting values, safety of values, but we have to understand the values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
This means what was the system of providing information
Because we are not aware of nature and for this we hear after sitting in our ears and airplanes but no one of us feels that this information is for me.
The same experience is in every sphere of our life.
We should not think that safety is for anyone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the feelings of social security are also inherent in us.
The objective of the GobarDhan scheme is to clean the villages and create wealth and energy by converting the solid waste of animal dung and field into compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China, animal dung and other organic wastes are used to produce energy but their full potential in India is not being utilized.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving in this direction.
Dhore dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, all these have been targeted to be used for biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see cow dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will greatly benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping the villages clean, better livestock health and better productivity.
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy issues for cooking and lighting.
It will help farmers and animal rearers to increase their incomes.
Opportunities for new jobs for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
An online training platform will also be set up to facilitate smooth functioning of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect farmers with buyers so that farmers can get a fair price for cow dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating a self-help group by forming a cooperative committee.
I invite you to be a part of this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs and take the initiative to convert waste into wealth and make Gobar-Dhan in your village.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh wherein the first 'Garbage Festival' was organised in the state.
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was cleanliness awareness, creating awareness about the creative use of the city's waste and the various ways to reuse the carbaage.
During the Festival, several activities took place, ranging from students to older people.
Different types of artefacts were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
Music performance was done on the theme of cleanliness and Art work was made.
Inspired by Raipur, different types of garbage festivals were organized in other districts too.
Everyone said innovative ideas regarding cleanliness, discussions and poetry were read out on their behalf.
An atmosphere like a festival has been created in terms of cleanliness.
The manner in which school children participated enthusiastically was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and cleanliness was displayed in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
There are several programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Nai Shakti Puraskar is being felicitated by women who have done exemplary work in various fields in the past.
I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life, it is the responsibility of all of us.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified with women, Yashodanan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, this is the identity of a son.
Today, our Nari Shakti has introduced self-confidence and self-confidence from her work and has made herself self-reliant.
He has not only advanced himself but has also worked to take the country and society forward and take it to a new chapter.
This is the dream of our New India where women are empowered, strong and equal partners in the development of the country.
In the last few days, I was given a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, there are several programmes to observe Women's Day. Can a felicitation programme of mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and town be organized
And can we talk about a long life in it, I think it is good to reach out to you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women and 15 lakh women have organized a month long cleanliness drive.
Starting from 26th January 2018, under this campaign, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
Can you imagine what a big event this is
These women from Jharkhand have demonstrated that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a force that will transform the cleanliness drive and cleanliness values into a habit of the common man in a normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was seeing in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You all are well aware that Elephanta Island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big centre of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years after independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbander and Setbandar - the darkness that had spread in the lives of the people there - have now become dark and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the caves of Elephanta village and Elephanta will be lighted with electricity.
This is not just electricity but a new beginning for development.
What could be a moment of more satisfaction and happiness than the illumination of the lives of the countrymen and their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March is the month of March, decorated fields, the golden emergence of the blossoming wheat and the splendor of the man who blossoms his heart. This is the speciality of this month.
But all of us are very much fond of this month's Holi festival.
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi with joy.
Holi is as important as Holika Dahan because it is a day to burn and destroy the evils.
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all sorrows, participate in each others happiness and conveys the message of love unity and brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to all my countrymen for the Holi festival.
May this festival fill the lives of our people with colorful happiness.
Mann Ki Baat January, 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat in 2018 and two days ago we celebrated the Republic Festival with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history it became such that the leaders of 10 countries were present at this function.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and I very much urge you to touch upon the subjects written in his letter.
He has written that the 17th February is the death anniversary of Kalpana Chawla.
He left us in the Colombia spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youngsters from all over the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter from the farewell of Kalpana Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age, but she gave a message to thousands of young women from all over the world, especially India, from her life that there is no limit to women power.
It is not impossible if there is a desire and determination to do something.
It gives me great pleasure to see that today women in India are moving fast in every field and increasing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour of women in our country, their place and their contribution in the society have kept the whole world wonderful.
Indian poets have a long tradition.
India has contributed a lot to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi are many names.
Today, we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. But centuries ago, in our scriptures, Skand Puran, it has been said: Dashaputra Samakanya, Dasputra Pravardhayan.
The more virtue one gets from ten daughters, the more virtue one gets from one daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And only then, women have been given the status of Shakti in our society.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, the mantra of unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples.
He writes that it is inspiring for our brave defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to fly the fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30.
He mentioned the crew members of the Indian Navy led by Vavika Joshi, performing the entire world on the INSV Tarini.
Three brave women have become Bhavna Kanth, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi fighter pilots and are undergoing training in Sukhoi-30.
The All Women Crew led by Capacity Vajpayee flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and Delhi to Air India Boeing Jet and all the ladies.
In the past, Honble President has taken a new initiative.
The President visited a group of exceptional women who showcased the first thing in their respective fields.
This is the first female merchant Navy captain of the country, the first female train driver of the passenger train, the first female firefighter, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach the Everest, thus the first woman to reach the Everest.
Our women powers have broken the stereotypes of society and achieved extraordinary achievements and set a record.
He pointed out that a new path can be prepared by overcoming all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, dedication and determination.
A path that will inspire not only its contemporary people but also generations to come.
It will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on Women Echo First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire nation can know about these women powers, draw inspiration from their lives and works.
It is also available as e-book on the NarendraModi website.
Today, the country's Nari Shakti plays an important role in the positive changes taking place in the country and the society.
Today, when we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention one railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you would be wondering what is the relationship between these two.
Matunga station in Mumbai is Indias first station with all women employees.
Whether it is a Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Checker, Incentive, Point Person or staff of more than 40 employees in all the departments are women.
This time many people wrote on Twitter and on other social media after watching the Republic Day Parade that one of the main topics of the parade was BSF Biker Continent, in which most women were participating.
He was experimenting with courage and surprised the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women power is leading.
When it comes to tribal women, a definite picture emerges in everyones mind, which has forests, pedestrians, ladies and gentlemen.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our Nari Shakti has created a new picture before the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, has created a terrible atmosphere of violence, bombs, guns, pistols.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running E-Rikshaw in such a dangerous area.
In a very short span of time, many women have joined her.
While on the one hand self-employment has empowered them, on the other hand, the pictures of the Maoist-affected area are changing.
And along with all this, the work of environment conservation is also being strengthened.
Continuous efforts have been made in our country at the level of individual and social levels for centuries against social evils and evils.
A few days ago, Bihar had taken an interesting initiative.
In order to root out social evils in the state, the worlds longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers was created Human Chain.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the virtues of childhood and childhood practices.
The entire state has pledged to fight against virtues such as dahej and child marriage.
Children, elderly people, youngsters, mothers, sisters and all of them took part in this struggle.
The human chain, which began from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, was unbreakably connected to the borders of the state.
It is essential for all the people of the society to get the benefits of development in the true sense that our society is free from these vices.
Let us collectively pledge to eradicate these virtues from the society and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administrator and every person in the human chain who made such a special and comprehensive initiative towards the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Karnataka has written on MyGov. The cost of medicines was Rs.
He was earlier not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Kendra.
But now when they came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, their cost of medicines was reduced by 5.
He expressed his desire to talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that maximum people can get information and take advantage of it.
Many people used to write and tell me about it for some time now.
I have also seen the video and social media of many people who have taken advantage of this scheme.
And it gives me great pleasure when I get this kind of information.
I get a deep satisfaction.
And I also felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had come across the idea that he would also get what he got.
The objective of the scheme is to make Healthcare Offordable and promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 0 of the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday, to a great extent.
The generic medicines sold in them are as per the norms of World Health Organisation.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for the Indian Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrit Stores in hospitals.
There is only one goal behind all this - to make the poorest of the poor of the country affordable health care facility so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Photos were such that my attention was drawn towards those photographs.
A grandson was participating in the cleaning drive of the Clean Morana River along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morna flowed for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal.
The other painful thing is that the river was completely filled with wild buffaloes, water bodies.
A lot of waste was being dumped on the river and its banks.
An action plan was prepared and one day before Makar Sankranti, on 13th January, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morna, at four places, both sides of Morana river were cleaned.
More than six thousand Akola citizens, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this nack work of Mission Clean More.
On 20th January 2018, the Swachhata Programme was continued in a similar manner and I was told that this campaign will run every Saturday until the Morana river is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible.
A massive change can be brought about through mass movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, to the administration of the district and city corporations and to every citizen engaged in making this work a mass movement. And this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you will hear a lot of discussions on the Padma awards these days.
Even in newspapers, attention is drawn on this subject and on TV.
But if you look at it with ease then you will be proud of the fact that how great people are amongst us and naturally it will be a matter of pride that how ordinary people of our country are reaching these heights without any emotion.
There has been a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
The entire process has become transparent due to online processing.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been completely transformed.
Now the significance of the work is not being done by the individual but the importance of the award is increasing.
You will be pleased to know that Mr. Aurobindo Gupta ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, dedicated his entire life in making toys for children.
He has been making toys from garbage for four decades so that the curiosity of science in children can be increased.
They are trying to inspire children from waste to scientific experiments for which they are going to three thousand schools across the country to showcase films made in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication.
One such thing is that of Karnataka's Sitava availability.
They are not called goddesses of women empowerment.
In the last three decades in Belagavi, he has contributed immensely to transforming the lives of countless women.
He dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven years, but later he spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Mr. Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, a tribal family.
He used to do ordinary jobs for life-style but he was keen to make traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this honour, he is respected not only in India but in the entire world.
Pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who illuminated India abroad, was recognized and honoured by Padmashri.
It will be a pleasant surprise to hear about Keralas tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal areas amidst dense forests.
He made 500 herbal medicines based on his memories.
He has been instrumental in making medicines that are used after snake bites.
Lakshmiji is constantly serving society with herbal medicines.
He was honoured with Padmashri for his contribution to the society by recognizing the sinful person.
Subhasini Mistry is such a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital.
When she was 23 years old, her husband died due to lack of treatment and due to that incident she inspired her to become a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hardworking hospitals.
I am confident that our Bahuratna Vasundhara has so many male and female stewards whom no one knows or knows.
The Padma awards are a medium but I would also tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who have been dedicated to the society around us, who have been dedicated to the society, who have worked with some specialty for their lives and sometimes they should be brought to the society.
They do not work for respect, but they inspire us because of their actions.
Sometimes such people should listen to their experiences in schools, colleges and colleges.
Beyond the awards, some efforts should be made in the society as well.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the 9th January when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and Indians all over the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized an event in which we invited all the MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living around the world.
You will be pleased to know that from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, where our original Indian Mayors, where the original Indian Parliamentarians, participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries but have also maintained their strong relations with India and this time I have sent the European Union, the European Union, to Calander, wherein they have exhibited their contributions in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians, who live in different countries of Europe, who are working in cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who suppress the minds of the society with their own music and somebody with their poems.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for doing RECOGNISE to the people of Indian origin and for informing people around the world through them.
30th January marks the death anniversary of revered Bapu who showed us a new path.
At present, we have seen every step that Bapu's words were true.
If we make a pledge that we should walk on Bapu's path, what could be a bigger tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes for 2018.
Mann Ki Baat December, 2019
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year and a coincidence is that today is also the last day of the year 2019.
Throughout the year we and you shared a lot of things.
Many of your letters, comments, exchange of ideas for Mann Ki Baat always bring a new energy to me.
Years will change after a few hours but this sequence of our conversations will continue as well.
In the coming years, we will talk about innovative things and sharing new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Recently, on 25th December, the festival of Christmas across the world was celebrated with fanfare.
People in India also celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recall the noble teachings of all Jesus Christ and the greatest emphasis that Isha Masih had on - Service.
My dear countrymen, this year also marked the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived his life on the basis of these values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a Guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior, inspired people in all these roles.
He fought against oppression and injustice.
He advised people to break the barriers of caste and religion.
In this endeavour, he had to lose a lot personally.
But they never gave place to the feeling of hatred.
In every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace was a personality filled with so many great qualities.
Let us take all the resolutions and take inspiration from the noble teachings and inspiring life of Guru Gobind Singh ji and try to shape life accordingly.
Those born in the year 2000 or later will become eligible voters from 1st January, 2018.
The Indian democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century, the New India voters.
I congratulate these youngsters and urge everyone to register themselves as their voters.
The entire country is keen to welcome you as the 21st century voters.
You will also be proud to be the voters of the 21st century.
Your opinion will be the basis of a New India.
The power of vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Our vote is the most effective tool to bring about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
However, you can also become the manufacturer of the 21st century India and it has started specifically since 1st January.
And today in this Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to our glorious youngsters with energy and determination from 18 to 25 years.
I believe that the skills and strengths of our bright youngsters will fulfil the dream of New India.
When we talk of a New India, a New India free from the poison of casteism, sectarianism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
New India where everyone has equal opportunities, where everyones hopes and aspirations are fulfilled.
A New India where peace, unity and goodwill are the driving force.
My New India Youth should come forward and churn out how to become a New India.
They should also set a roadmap for themselves, they should connect with them and keep on moving forward.
You also move forward, the country too will move forward.
Today, when I was talking to you, I had a thought that can we organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Where these 18-25 year olds will sit together and churn on New India, find roads and make plans.
How can we realize our solemn pledges before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the glorious 21st century India.
How to achieve salvation
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation and Entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and becoming successful.
I would like to know about all these opportunities, how to get this New India Youth at one place and create a system in this regard so that whenever they are 18 years old, they can easily know about this world, they can take the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken to you about the importance of positivity.
I remember a shloka from Sanskrit - which means a person full of enthusiasm is extremely powerful because nothing can be beyond enthusiasm.
Nothing is impossible for a person with positivity and enthusiasm.
People in English also say - "Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power".
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share your positive moments of 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people have given a very positive response to the social media platforms, MyGov and the NarendraModi App and their experiences.
Lakhs of tweets have been tweeted along with Positive India hashtag, reaching out to more than 150 crore people.
In a way, the communication of positivity that took place in India spread all over the world.
Tweets and responses were truly inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some Indians have shared these events this year which have had a special impact on their minds and have had a positive impact.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I would like to speak to Bodal.
Our insurance coverage was one rupee per month.
This was done by my husband and he passed away in an accident.
We know what was the situation at that time.
With this help of the government, we were benefitted a lot.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
From our village, Bhinnar has been passing through the National Highway since 2019.
This will improve our roads and also increase trade.
My name is Deepshu Ahuja, Region Sadatganj, District Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bevani.
There was a problem of water in our area and for 40 years we had to depend on the army pipeline.
Now this is a separate pipeline - free.
So all these great achievements are in 2019.
There are many people who have been doing such things at their own level which is bringing about a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Come, let us enter the New Year with these little joys and start a New Year and move from Positive India to Progressive India.
When we talk about positivity, I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I learnt about the inspiring facts of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, the Administrative Service in Kashmir.
He has come out of the menace of terrorism and hatred and secured first rank in the Kashmir Administrative Service.
You will be surprised to know that the terrorists had burnt their ancestral homes in 10th century.
There was so much of terrorism and violence that his family had to leave their ancestral land.
For a young child, the atmosphere of such violence all around him was enough to create darkness and bitterness in the heart - but Anjum did not allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation is, the darkness of depression can also be spread through positive actions.
Just recently, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The enthusiasm, the zeal and the dreams that I have been listening to, they want to progress in the field of living.
The more I spent time with those daughters, the more I got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, this is my youth and this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are discussions about the famous religious places of not only our country but also about the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala, it is very natural.
Every year crores of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami in this world famous temple.
Where such a large number of devotees come, the place where such a great significance is, there is such a big challenge to maintain cleanliness.
And especially those places which are situated between mountains and forests .
But the Sabarimala Temple itself is an example of how this problem can be changed in values and how the path to get out of the problem can be found.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan launched a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And a tradition has been created so that the journey of those travelers who come here is not complete until they do some or some other physical work in the cleanliness programme.
There is nothing big or small in this campaign.
Every traveler considers it as a part of the worship of God and does some work for cleanliness, he works for the removal of dirt.
Every morning the view of cleanliness here is very unique and all the pilgrims get involved in it.
Whether it is a big CELEBRITY or not, whether it is a rich person, whether it is a big officer or not, every individual becomes a part of this programme like an ordinary traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
Such a cleanliness drive in Sabarimala and the sacred Punakvanam in it become a part of the journey of every traveler.
Along with a strong pace, the hard resolve of cleanliness also goes along with it.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, all of us have pledged that the incomplete work of revered Bapu i. e.
Pujya Bapu used to strive for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we should do something to give him the India of his dreams, the Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a massive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Transformation is also visible due to mass participation in rural and urban areas.
The worlds largest survey- Swachh Survekshan-2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the achievements of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will cover about 40 crore people in more than four thousand cities.
The survey includes Open Defecation Free (ODF) in cities, Waste Collection, Transportation for Waste Effluents, Scientific Waste Processing, Efforts for Behavioral Change, Capacity Building and Innovative Efforts for Cleanliness and Public Partnership for this work.
During the survey, different forces will visit and inspect the cities.
They will interact with the citizens and respond to them.
It will also analyze the use of Swachhta App and improve various service spaces.
It will also be seen in this thing that this kind of system has been made by cities that will make the cleanliness of the city the habit of the people and the city becomes a habit.
Cleanliness should not be done by the government alone.
Every citizen and civil society association has a huge responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to take part in the Swachhata Survekshan in the coming days.
And your city should not be left behind, you should not be left behind in your streets.
I am confident that the use of green and blue wastes by separating dry wastes and wet wastes from homes would have become your habit.
In the Swachhta Survekshan from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, in this healthy competition, you should not be left behind - this should become a topic of public debate in every city.
And you all should have a dream: our city our effort, our immense progress: the progress of the country.
Let us fulfil this solemn pledge once again by remembering revered Bapu and making a pledge for a Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things that look very small but have far reaching impact on our identity as a society.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share this thing with you.
One thing came in our knowledge is that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage then she cant go without Maharam or her male guardian.
When I first heard about it, I wondered how this could happen.
Who would have made such rules
Why is such a discrimination
And when I went deep into it then I was disturbed. Even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who used to apply such restrictation.
For decades, injustice was being done to Muslim women but there was no mention of it.
Even in many Islamic countries this rule is not there.
But Muslim women in India were not entitled to this right.
And I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has also taken these necessary steps and by abolishing the tradition that has been going on for the past 70 years, we have removed this restrictation.
Today Muslim women can go for Haj without Mehram. And I am glad that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied for Haj without Mehram and women from different parts of the country have expressed their desire to travel for Haj from Kerala to North.
And I firmly believe that Indias development journey will continue to move ahead with the strength and talent of our women power.
It should be our constant endeavour that our women get equal rights and equal opportunities so that they can move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
There will be not one but ten chief guests on Republic Day this time.
This has never happened in the history of India.
2019 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years of its partnership in 2019 and it is in 2017 that India has completed 25 years of its partnership with ASEAN.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present here on the 26th of January with these great leaders from 10 countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written.
We all have just celebrated Christmas and a new year is about to come.
May the coming year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let all of us move ahead with new zeal, enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolutions and take the country forward.
The month of January is the time of sunrise and Makar Sankranti is celebrated this month.
Lohri joys in Punjab and Northern India, while UP-Bihar awaits Khichdi and Silk Sankranti.
Sankranti Kaho in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals are special in themselves and they have their own significance.
Each festival is celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
The names of each of these festivals are different, but their roots are the same linkages with nature and agriculture.
Many congratulations to every countryman on these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my countrymen.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
Those conversations were similar to those who talked to their elder brothers and sisters with great devotion.
Listen to how in this phase of AYUSH, Lata Didi is eager for all the things related to the country and the satisfaction of life is also in India's progress.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, salute.
I am speaking Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Pranam.
Modi ji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go back
Modi ji: I will be back on 28th late night and 2nd morning and then your birthday will be there.
Lata ji: There are a lot of people in the age group but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those people who are bigger than their work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are very old in your age and are older in work and those who have achieved this achievement have achieved it by doing meditation and penance.
Lata ji: Yes, I think it is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
I am nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, today it is your humility, it is a great education for all of our new generation.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after clearing all this in our lives, we have always given priority to the values and humility of your parents.
Lata ji: G.
And I am glad that when you proudly say that your mother was Gujarati.
And whenever I came to you, Mr. G. Modi Ji gave me some Gujarati.
I know that the picture of India is changing due to your arrival. And I am very happy with that.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see, I know how busy you are and how much work you do.
What needs to be considered.
When you went and touched your mother's feet then I also sent someone and received their blessings.
Modi ji: Yes.
My son was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will be here very soon.
It will be my privilege.
Modi ji: Pranam Didi.
My best wishes to you, Lataji.
Modi ji: Pranam G.
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, from today onwards, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal, new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolutions.
The climate of the festivals is very pleasant.
Festivals across the country will be enchanting for several weeks to come.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this saying is not just a word, it is an order, a philosophy and an inspiration for all of us.
In some households sweets get spoilt while in some households children bump for sweets.
This is the darkness at the bottom of Diu.
The real pleasure of these festivals is when darkness is darkness, this darkness is low - it is brightness.
Let us share happiness wherever there is a lack and where it is our nature.
Think about giving one moment to another when there is a delivery of sweets, clothes and gifts in our homes.
At least, we can share those things with others which we dont take into account in a large quantity in our homes.
Start-ups of young colleagues of several NGOs work like this in many cities.
They collectively discover clothes, sweets, pomegranates and discover the needy from their homes and secretly do this.
Can this time, be able to eradicate darkness at the bottom of this diya with full awareness and determination in this festival season
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals. Your face will glow.
Your lamp will be brighter and your Diwali will be brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmi ji is coming home to Deepawali in the form of good luck and prosperity.
Laxmiji is traditionally welcomed.
Can we keep our society, villages, cities and girls honoured this time
Can you keep public programs
There will be several daughters amongst us who will be glowing the name of the family, the society and the country with their hard work and talent.
Can we celebrate India's Lakshmi's honour on this Diwali
There will be several daughters and sisters around us who are doing extraordinary work.
If a poor person is working to educate children, if someone is engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health then someone would be serving the society by becoming a doctor, engineer.
As a lawyer, we must have been trying to bring somebody to justice.
May our society recognize, respect and take pride in such daughters.
His felicitation programmes will be held across the country.
Promotion of Laxmi of India means paving the way for prosperity of the country and its people.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the biggest benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I get the opportunity to have direct and indirect interaction with many strangers.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
When the result of my exams came, some people asked me to read the Exam Warriors book.
I have not read this book.
But I came back and read this book twice or thrice.
My experience was very good about it.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination, I would have benefitted a lot.
My little student friend, first of all, thank you for writing this letter.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take out time for renewal then I will definitely try to write a few things for my parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to tell me about your experiences related to stress-free examinations.
So I will wait for your thoughts.
I once again express my gratitude to our little friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tyang.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through news papers and through TV.
But you know that I too am a common man like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and therefore, the impact that affects me in a normal life also affects my mind because I have come here amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he was finally awarded the Grand Slam winner and Tennis legendary Rafael Nadal.
The audience was welcomed by the audience.
Despite being defeated in difficult challenges, he lauded his rival canal and gave a living testimony to the sportsmanship.
However, on the other hand, the winner also appreciated the Daniel Games.
The zeal of the losers in the same match and the humility of the winners were both spectacular.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev, I will tell you all, especially the youth that you must watch this video.
The philosophy of our ancestors is truly commendable.
It is said in the scriptures: i. e. when a person gets admired with efficiency and humility, then who cant win his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, I am going to talk directly to you people about this thing.
But if some things are stopped before it grows then it will be of immense benefit.
It becomes very difficult to stop the things that increase a lot.
However, a lot can be saved if we wake up at the outset and stop it.
My mind says that in this spirit, today, especially the young friends, we must do some things.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The danger of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to the people who consume tobacco.
Everyone says this.
The intoxication of tobacco is due to the nicotine present in it .
Its consumption during adolescence also affects the development of brain .
But today, I would like to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that recently e-cigarettes have been banned in India.
E-cigarettes are a kind of electronic apparatus apart from ordinary cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, heating of nicotine rich substances makes a chemical fluid through which nicotine is consumed.
We understand the dangers of ordinary cigarettes very well, but a misconception about e-cigarettes has been created.
There is a misunderstanding that there is no danger of e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are being obtained in the same way as the rest of the cigarettes.
We have seen that even if there is a father-child-smacker in the house, he stops smoking the rest of the house and wants his children not to get used to cigarette-BD.
It is their effort that no family member should smoke or smoke.
They are aware that smoking has caused a lot of harm to the body.
The drinkers also know and the viewers also know.
However, the issue of e-cigarettes is very different.
People are not so aware about e-cigarettes.
They are also very unaware of its dangers and because of this, sometimes e-cigarettes are quietly entering the house in curse and sometimes showcasing the miracles, children keep showing to each other.
See, I take out the smoke from my mouth, see, without any fire, without fire, and see, I take out the smoke.
Once the adolescents and the youth of the house get stuck in their grip then gradually they become addicted to this addiction and become victims of bad addiction.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are obtained in e-cigarettes which have a bad effect on health.
You must be aware that when someone smokes around us then we get to know about it from the smell.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in its pockets, it can be detected by the smell.
However, this is not the case with e-cigarettes, so many youngsters and youngsters know-how and sometimes they are seen roaming around in their books, in their offices, in their pockets, in their pockets and in their hands and they become prey to them.
The younger generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that these new methods of intoxication do not ruin our young country.
Do not waste the dreams of every family and the lives of children do not go waste.
This disease, this habit does not fit into the society.
I urge all of you to quit tobacco addiction and not to mislead anybody in relation to e-cigarette.
Let us together build a healthy India.
All of this has to be avoided for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great fortune for all of us that our country has been the birthplace and workplace of such extraordinary people who have dedicated their lives not for themselves but for the betterment of others.
This is our Mother India, this is our country's Vasundhara.
Many human jewels emanate from this land.
India has been home to such extraordinary people.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves but for others.
One such distinguished personality is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pop Francis will be honored by Mary Threasia on October 13.
The work that Sister Mary Threasy has done for the betterment of humanity in his short career of fifty years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever Sister Threasia did, he fulfilled it with dedication and sincerity.
Who is still carrying forward his vision and mission.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating 150th Gandhi, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from single use plastic.
Looking at the way India has led the entire world towards environment conservation, today the eyes of all countries are visible to India.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
He said people are contributing in this mission in their own way.
However, it is our country that has carried out a unique campaign for the youth of this country.
When I came to know about his work then I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand this new experiment.
It may be that these things can be used for other people of the country.
ShrimanRipudanBelviji is making a good effort.
When I first heard the word plogging then I was also new to me.
Overseas, perhaps that word has been used in some measure.
But in India, Ripudan Belviji has made this very popular.
I congratulate him and my friends, this time on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Sports Ministry is also going to organize a Fit India Plogging Run.
We have heard from the experience of Rippudan ji how to do this programme and what is happening in the programme.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then our India will take 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Once again, thanks a lot to Ripudan ji.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into national interest.
One thing is intended to be remembered soon.
However, in the coming Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely extend it to the region. But today I am saying this thing just a while ago so that you get the opportunity to prepare it.
You remember that 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in lakhs of villages of India, children, elderly people, schools, colleges and thousands of villages.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places of India.
Make at least 15 places and if it can be made then make a program to stay for one night and two nights.
You see India, understand and experience it.
We have so many diversities. And when this festival of Diwali comes, people definitely visit and therefore I would urge you to visit some 15 such places of India.
And what kind of reforms are there, where do I tell you
You will be happy to know that today our ranking is 34 and our ranking is 65th five years ago.
If we try more, by the time we mark 75 years of independence, we will make our place as the world's leading destinations in tourism.
Yes, it is also important that there is no fire, no loss due to crackers etc. during Diwali.
You must take whatever precautions are required for that.
Our festivals also bring fragrance of collectivity and collective values.
Community life gives a new strength and it is a destination for learning of new energy.
Let us celebrate festivals with joy and enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolutions.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a short while ago, I had the opportunity to interact indirectly with the young friends of Karnataka.
Times Group's Vijay Karnataka Akhbar Baldin urged the children to write to the Prime Minister of the country.
And then he published some of the selected letters.
I read those letters, I felt very nice.
These small children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the discussions going on in the country.
These children have written on many topics: Kirti Hagde of North Kannada has explained Digital India and Smart City schemes and suggested that we need to bring about a change in our education system, he added that today children do not like to study in classrooms.
And if we give children respect about nature then perhaps it can help us in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadaf from Lakshmeshwar has written that she is the daughter of a soldier.
And he said that because the school is far away, I cannot spend time with my friends, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
This was a good experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On this day in 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whoever reads the conversation then we feel proud that what is the idea of a dedicated life for the nation
Can you imagine how hard he would have worked to shape the Constitution of our country full of diversity
And that too at a time when the country was getting rid of the slavery.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India by keeping in mind the ideas of the creators of the Constitution and those great men.
Our Constitution is very broad.
Perhaps there is no such area of life, there is no subject of nature which he has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity for all is the hallmark of our Constitution.
It protects the basic rights of every citizen, poor or dalit, backward or deprived, tribal, women.
and safeguard their interests.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution alphabetically.
Be it citizens or administrators, let us move ahead in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
The Constituent Assembly constituted seventy different committees on important topics.
One of the most important committees was the draft committee and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Mosque Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
The Constitution of India that we feel proud of today is an indelible mark of Babasaheb Ambedkar's skilled leadership.
He ensured that the welfare of every section of the society is ensured.
On December 6th, we salute him on his Mahaparinirvana Diwas by remembering him like Kayam.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
The 15th December marks the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel, the Iron Man of the country, had done an extraordinary job of building the country in one line.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day, however, nine years ago, on 26-11, terrorists attacked Mumbai, how can the country forget it
This country can never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism has become a terrible form of everyday incidents in every part of the world and in a way.
We have been suffering a lot in India for the last 40 years due to terrorism.
At that time there were several people in the world who were not prepared to take it seriously but today when terrorism is staring at its own periphery then every government of the world is seeing terrorism as a big challenge by those governments who believe in humanism, those who believe in democracy.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
It is going to destroy human forces.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world are coming together to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi are the gems of this soil that have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and militancy are a negative effort to disrupt and weaken our social tensions.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to make humanitarian forces more aware.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December, we will celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy seeks protection and security of our coastline.
I congratulate all those involved in the Navy.
You all are aware that our civilization is on the banks of rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu or Ganga or Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and oceans are both economic and strategic.
It is our entrance to the entire world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
And when we look at history, the Chaunnavi-Chaula Naval Force was considered one of the most powerful naval forces during the Chaula dynasty eight hundred and ninety years ago.
In the expansion of the Chaul empire, his navy had a very large part in making it an economic super power at that time.
Chaul Navi's zeal, search trips are still found in a number of liberal Sangam literature.
Very few people will be aware of the fact that most of the naval forces in the world have received permission from women on naval ships at a very remote location.
But in the Chaunakal and that too eight hundred and nine hundred years ago, women played a very important role and even women were involved in the fight.
The Chaul rulers had immense knowledge of shipbuilding and ship building.
When we talk of the Navy, who can forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy
The coastal area of Konkan where the rivers are very important came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the coast or were surrounded by the sea.
The Marine Navy was responsible for the defence of these forts.
The Marathi navy had a combination of large ships and small boats.
Their naval personnel were very skilled in attacking and escaping any enemy.
And when we talk about the Marathi navy then how can it be possible that Kanoji Angre does not remember it
He took the Marathas Navy to greater heights and established Marathas Naval Stations at various locations.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its might at different times.
Whether it is Goas Liberation War or the 11th Indo-Pakistan War.
Even during the severe floods in Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three ships of our Navy arrived immediately and helped its government and its people.
Our naval ship INS Gadariya provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingya in September last year in Bangladesh.
In the month of June, when the government of Papua-Nugiene sent a message to us and requested to save fishermen of their fishing boats, our Navy helped us.
On the 21st, our naval ship INS Trikand arrived in the Western Akhara to assist in the eviction of a merchant vessel.
Our Navy has always been proud of providing health services to Fiji Island, providing immediate relief and providing humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country.
We, Indians, always respect and pride for our defence forces, be it the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, salute the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
Hundreds and crores of Indians can lead the life of Sukhchen, so the jawans sacrifice their lives for the country.
We celebrate the 7th December every year as an armed Flag Day.
It is a day to take pride and honour in the Armed Forces of this country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the drive from 1st to 7th December to make people aware about the Armed Forces by reaching out to the citizens of the country.
All the smaller ones put this flag on the chest.
A movement of respect for the army begins in the country.
We can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces on this occasion.
You can post your experiences of the Armed Forces who are associated with the armed forces in their identities around you with video and photos related to them with armedforcesflagday.
You can get information about the army from schools, colleges and army personnel by inviting them.
Our new generation can have a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This festival also provides an opportunity to raise funds for the welfare of all our Armed Forces personnel.
The Fund is being spent by the Army Welfare Board on the rehabilitation of the families of the soldiers who were martyred in the war and for the welfare of the injured soldiers.
Come on, let us do something that will strengthen the morale of our Armed Forces.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the fifth December is World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth .
Whatever we eat is attached to this soil.
In a way, the entire food system is connected to the soil.
Imagine how a human life would have been possible if there were no land or plants.
This is the reason why we have been aware of the importance of our soil since ancient times.
On the one hand, it is an easy effort to live in our culture towards farms, towards soil, devotion and respect, while on the other hand, scientific methods of nurturing this land have been a part of our lives.
Both aspects of the life of the farmers of this country have been important, in which devotion to their land as well as scientific conservation of land.
I had heard about farmers from Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Earlier the farmers used fertilizers and chemical fertilizers and due to which the health of their soil was spoiled.
The yield declined and consequently the income declined as well as the productivity of the soil was slowly declining.
Some farmers from the village understood the seriousness of the situation and after that they examined their land in time and advised them to use as much fertilizers, fertilizers, micronutrients and organic fertilizers as they were asked to use.
You will also be surprised to hear the results, what was the result of the farmers getting the benefits of land health and the guidance they received
These farmers have seen a three-four-fold increase in the production of wheat in the month of 2016-17.
Our farmers across the country have made more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land better and can also grow crops accordingly.
We worship Mother Earth but how much harm is the health of Mother Earth due to chemical fertilizers like urea
All kinds of scientific experiments have proved that giving more urea to Mother Earth is a serious loss.
Today is the need of the hour to create awareness about this mother-daughter relationship once again.
Can our farmers, our sons and the children of our soil make a solemn pledge that the amount of urea they use today will make half of it when we complete 75 years of independence in 2022
How the change starts in the life of the farmer
We all are beginning to experience global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the winter used to start before Diwali.
Today, the December twelve is knocking and the cold is slowly increasing.
But as the cold begins, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the quilt.
But even in such a weather, the people who are constantly awake can produce beautiful results. And that example is inspiring for all of us.
That little child Tushar has done an inspiring job in spreading the message of cleanliness.
They show that there is no age of cleanliness, there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an old person, whether it is a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for all.
And there is also a need to bite everyone for cleanliness.
This is the commitment of our Divyang brothers and sisters.
The moment we learn something.
Today, he is doing well in every field.
Whether it is the field of sports or any competition or any social initiative, even our Divyangjans are not behind anybody.
You will remember that our Divyang sportspersons had won four medals by performing well in the Rio Olympics and had also become Champions in the Blind Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several competitions across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and showcased their skills.
He also won the Golden uadrilateral at the 70th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected for the 20-20 Paralympics Competition by Sports Authority of India.
32, one of the para-trainers who will be trained at the Central for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the zeal of brother Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today, special attention is being given to accessibility and opportunity for the Divyangjans.
It is our endeavor to empower every person in the country.
Building an inclusive society and harmonizing the society with a sense of equality and compassion.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all fellow citizens. And I hope that this festival of Id will inspire all of us to further peace and harmony in the society.
Forget sorrow, and do not forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this thing.
We have tried to revive many interesting events of the last year in the wake of publicity.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember such occasions that inspire others.
Remembering good things, there will be a sense of righteousness and a mood will be created.
Good things, they provide energy to improve.
And I will try to take the details of your Positive India Hashtag Positive India to the countrymen in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will be with you again next month for Mann Ki Baat.
I will get an opportunity to talk a lot.
All India Radio on 2nd October, 2019
Chhath, celebrated six days after Diwali, is one of the most rules and loyal festivals in our country.
Traditional rules are complied with in every aspect ranging from food to clothing.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely related to nature and worship of nature .
The sun and water are at the centre of Chhath worship, while bamboo and earthen vessels and kandamals are an integral part of its worshipping process.
The message of worship of the rising sun and the rising sun in this great festival is full of unparalleled values.
The festival also includes an important expression of cleanliness in our lives.
The cleanliness of the entire house before the sixth century, along with the river, pond, pond, and the pond, the place of worship, that is, the valley, is cleaned with all the zeal.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environment conservation, disease prevention and discipline.
Ordinarily, people consider it an unscrupulous feeling of taking something, but in Chhath Puja, there has been a special tradition of seeking prasad after the morning.
Behind this tradition of seeking prasad, it is also demonstrated that it destroys the arrogance.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat keeps on praising and criticizing.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief is firmly strengthened that Mann Ki Baat has been bound by a hundred percent unbreakable relationship with the people of this country.
Take the examples of Khadi and Handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always advocated for handloom, Khadi and what is the outcome.
You must have been pleased to hear that Khadi and Handloom sales are being done at the same store.
During Diwali, sales of Khadi Gift Cooperation registered a growth of about 680.
The total sales of Khadi and handicrafts have shown a growth of nearly 70 this year over the previous year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women of all ages like Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how it will benefit many weaver families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
Khadi is creating a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by bringing about a change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very important role for Gramodaya.
Shri Rajan Bhatta has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my experience of Diwali with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces consider Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwade has also written on the Narendra Modi App: Why can we make arrangements for our households to reach the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the people of the country.
Everyone will be celebrating Diwali with great joy.
Diwali has also brought a special experience for me this time too.
Once again I got the privilege to celebrate Diwali with our soldiers deployed on the border.
This time it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute every citizen of our security forces for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice for the hardships and odds faced by our security forces.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should get to know about the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their pride.
Many of us may not be aware that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our border but around the world.
As UN peacekeeping ambassadors, they are shining the name of India in the world.
Recently, on 24th October, United Nations Day was observed throughout the world.
Everyone remembers the positive role of the UN in establishing peace in the world.
And we believe in the VasudhaivaKutumbakam - the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the UN since its inception.
You would be aware that both the proposals of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begin with the words WETHE PEOPLE.
India has always emphasized on women equality and UN DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS is a living testimony.
All men are burn free and equivalent, which was later accepted by the Indian representative Hansa Mehta. All human beings are burn free and equivalent.
Though it seems to be a very small change, but a healthy thought is seen in it.
There will be many of your mothers who are receiving this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served in the UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PEACEKEEPING INITIATIVES and is the third highest in the world.
Till August 2019, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 OPERATIONS out of 17 UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.
This OPERATIONS runs in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, parts of the world.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated and countless people have been rescued at the Indian Army Hospital in Congo and Southern Sudan.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by doing People Friendly Operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peacekeeping.
Very few people would be aware that India was the first country to send a Female Police Unit to the UN Peace Mission in Liberia.
And, see, this step of India has become an inspiration for countries all over the world.
And then all the countries started sending their respective Women Police Units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not limited to just Peacekeeping operations but India is also engaged in training the Peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony across the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to work in difficult areas.
We have to stay amongst different people.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to adapt themselves in accordance with the local needs and environment there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who distinguished himself in Cyprus.
At the age of 27 years in 1987, he was made the Force Commander for Operation in Namibia and provided his services for ensuring the independence of the country.
General Thimayya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid down his best for peace and prosperity.
As a peace ambassador, India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
We believe that everyone will live peacefully, harmoniously and move forward towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has been embraced by those great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini's statement, was one of the exceptional people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda named him Vedita.
And the statement means those who are completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself according to his name.
Yesterday was the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Sister Statement.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for a happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Statement was deeply saddened by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
The British not only made our country a sin but also tried to make us mentally sinful.
Our culture was degraded and this work was going on incessantly.
BhaginiVeditaji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to unite people by creating national consciousness.
He went to different countries of the world to raise his voice against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati is famous for her revolutionary poem Pudumai Penn, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that its inspiration was Bhagini's statement.
Bhagni Nivedita ji also supported the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped in publication and propagation of Basu research through his writings and conferences.
This is the unique beauty of India that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Bhagini's statement and scientific Jagdishchandra Basu are a strong example of this.
In 1988, a horrific plague took place in Kolkata and killed hundreds of people.
Bhagini's statement started the work of cleaning Nike and roads without worrying about her health.
He was a woman who could lead a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifice, the people joined him in service.
He explained the importance of cleanliness and service to the people through his work.
And it is written on his memorial - 'Here Repose Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India' - here, Bhagini's statement, which dedicated her everything to India.
Undoubtedly, he did so.
Today, there can be no other rightful tribute to this great personality that every Indian should take inspiration from his life and try to follow the path of service.
First of all, Children's Day, best wishes to all children on Children's Day, on the birth anniversary of our first Chief Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the most important diamonds in building a New India.
Your concern is true that the earlier diseases that used to take place in the older age and the last stage of life are now being seen in the children too.
Today, a lot of surprises are happening when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Youngsters were fortunate to have such diseases.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today, these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for getting afflicted with such diseases in young age is the defect in physical activity in our lifestyle and the change in our eating habits.
This needs to be addressed by society and family.
When they think about it, you must see that there is no need to specify.
There is a need to change the habits and make them oneself one by following the rules and regulations.
I would like the family members to make every effort to ensure that the children go to the open ground.
If possible, the elders of our family should also play with these children in the open.
Instead of coming up in the lift make the children habituated to stairs .
After dinner the whole family moves a little after keeping the children together .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will help our young friends, especially in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorder.
30 minutes of yoga is beneficial before going to school.
You can do it at home as well and the speciality of Yoga is the same - it is easy, simple and accessible. And I can easily say that any adult can do it easily.
Several research studies are being carried out to find out how effective Yoga is in controlling diabetes.
AIIMS is also being studied and the results that have come up so far are very encouraging.
We should not only make Ayurveda and Yoga a medium of treatment but also make it a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, in the field of sports, good news has come in the past days.
Our sportspersons have brought laurels for our country in different sports.
India has won the Asia Cup hockey by playing a splendid game in Hockey.
Our sportspersons have excelled and made India the Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, India became the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2003.
Many congratulations to the entire team and supporting staff on behalf of me and on behalf of the countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has also come to India in badminton.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth, performing excellently, has made every Indian proud by winning the Denmark Open.
This is their third Super Series Premiere after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing India's pride.
Friends, this month FIFA U-1 World Cup was organized.
Teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their warmth at the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to one match.
Sportspersons and athletes were very excited.
The world is witnessing such a big event of the World Cup.
Such a big match... I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm and spirit of all the young athletes.
The World Cup was successfully organised and all the teams performed their best.
Though India may not be able to win, Indias young sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
The entire world, including India, acknowledged this festival of sports and the entire competition was fun and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright and signals are visible.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, as many people write to me about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then I will have to make a programme of Mann Ki Baat every day and I will have to dedicate every day to Mann Ki Baat on the topic of cleanliness.
Sometimes it is the story of the collective efforts of the youth when they send a bundle of attempts by mistakes.
Whether there is an innovation related to cleanliness or there is news of changes caused by the public sentiments of an officer.
In the last few days, I have received a very detailed report of the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGOs named Economic Protection Organization (EPO) will undertake the cleanliness drive of Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me a picture of the fort before and after cleanliness.
I was stunned to see the photographs and whenever you see these photographs, you might feel depressed to see the dirt around you and sometimes they would feel that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled then I would tell them that you can see the youth, their sweat, their zeal and your resolves in a live picture.
Your despair will turn into confidence after seeing this.
This gracious effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collectivity and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of our countrymen to preserve and clean the historical heritage.
I congratulate the Economic Protection Organization and its entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will commemorate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
He thought of the welfare of mankind as a whole, and treated all communities as one.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women's dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28,000 kilometers on foot and during his journey he conveyed the message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and dedication.
He conveyed the message of equality in society and not merely through words, but through his actions.
He launched an anchor that generated service among the people.
The adoption of anchor by sitting together created a sense of unity and equality among the people.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of a meaningful life - Name God, work hard and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji had also created Gurbani to speak for him.
We will be celebrating the 550th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
Let us strive to move ahead on the path of teaching and message.
My dear countrymen, after two days we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
We all know that he laid the foundation for a modern unbroken India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great son of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only used to think transformatively but was also an expert in exploring practical solutions to the problem of complications.
He had a fountainhead in realising the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took charge of building India in a thread.
He ensured that crores of Indians are brought under the shadow of One Nation and One Constitution.
Their decision-making ability enabled them to overcome all hurdles.
Wherever there was a need for respect and respect, he respected and exploited force where there was a need for force.
We cannot stop any distinction between caste and creed, it is the daughters and daughters of all India. We must love our country and build our policy on mutual love and goodwill, he added.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for our vision of a New India.
And this is the reason that his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution in shaping the country as a unbroken nation is incomparable.
On the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, Run for Unity will be organized across the country on 31st October, which will include children, youth, women and all age groups from all over the country.
I urge you to also participate in this celebration of 'Run for Unity'.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new determination, you have once again joined your daily lives.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
Three years have been completed by Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani, today it is 36 episodes.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat then people from all corners of the country take it to me. Perhaps I can tell you very little but I get plenty of money.
Most of them inspire me.
Many are for reforms in the government.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes attention is drawn towards the collective problem.
And I take you half an hour a month but people talk about Mann Ki Baat on the third day.
And consequently, it is very easy to understand the sensitivity of the government and the powers that have been created in far-flung societies.
And that is why this journey of three years of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man in such a short span of time.
And I believe that this deliberation will be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future. It will also provide a new consciousness and a new energy.
Once I had said Mann Ki Baat that while eating, we should worry about eating as much as we need, we should not waste it.
But after that I saw that so many letters were received from every corner of the country, so many social organizations and several youngsters were doing this work beforehand.
Several people who worked on the food plate that was left out of it collectively came to my notice so that I was very satisfied and very happy.
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw a selfie white daughter from a sarpanch of Haryana and I spoke to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
A massive campaign of selfie with daughter was launched not only in India but also in the entire world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
It became a new self-confidence and a new pride for every daughter.
Every parent felt that I too would take a selfie with my daughter.
Every daughter began to feel that I have some significance, I have some importance.
Recently, I had a meeting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Whenever I asked the people travelling on tour to send a photo of the Incredible India wherever you go.
Lakhs of images from every corner of India, in a way, have become a great honor for the people working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this thing in Mann Ki Baat that how big a movement is going to start a small event.
Today I got the feeling of saying all these things because when I was thinking that it has been three years then several incidents of the last three years have been stuck in my mind.
The country is constantly moving towards the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of others, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country. I have understood and learnt from my countrymen during my three year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is a huge capital for any country, this is a very powerful force.
I salute my countrymen.
The attraction of Khadi has increased in the younger generation, be it in the houses or be it toilets or be it in the houses or be it the houses or be it the toilets or be it the curtains or be it the curtains.
Sale of Khadi has increased and this has resulted in direct employment in the houses of the poor.
Discount is being given in Khadi from 2nd October and several exemptions are being given.
Once again I would urge you all to carry forward the mission of Khadi.
Let us work with the spirit of purchasing Khadi and lighting Diwali in the house of the poor.
This will give strength to the poor of our country and we should do it.
And due to the increasing interest in Khadi, the Khadi sector has also increased the enthusiasm of the Khadi people in the Government of India to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar-handedness
How to revive the ancient heritage that had been shut down for 20-20, 25-25 and 30 years
In Varanasi, Sewapur, Uttar Pradesh, Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Various types of activities were added.
Several people were given new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed their closed training centre and Kashmir has a lot to offer in this area.
Now the resumption of this Training Centre will help the new generation in building modern drains, working in fashion and making new things. And I am feeling very good that when a large corporate house is also offering gifts in Diwali then Khadi goods are now being offered.
People have also started offering Khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all experience how things can move forward in a simple manner.
My dear countrymen, we all made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we decided to celebrate the 15 days of Gandhi Jayanti in the entire country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President started this work and the country got connected.
Be it children, old people or women or cities or villages, today everyone has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
And when I say 'Sankalp se Siddhi', how the cleanliness drive is moving towards achieving a solemn pledge, we see it in front of our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, supports it, and contributes to the realization of it.
This time one thing is also seen - one thing that we should do cleanliness, the other is that we should not waste by being aware, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then a thought movement is also necessary.
This time, several competitions were held with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in Swachhta essay competition.
Thousands of children made paintings.
As long as it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
We can see how the electronic media of our country and the print media can serve the country in the movement of Swachhata Hi Seva.
A few days back, someone had noticed me about the 18 year old Billal Dar of Srinagar.
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has made Bill Dar its brand ambassador for cleanliness. And when it comes to Band Ambassador then you will feel that perhaps it will be a cinema actor, perhaps it will be a hero of the world of sports.
Billal Dar himself has been in Swachhta for the past 5-6 years from the age of 12-13 years.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, where be it plastic, polythene or waste, it keeps cleaning.
It also earns a little.
Because his father died of cancer at a very young age, but he also linked his life with cleanliness.
I also want to convey my best wishes to the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for this initiative towards cleanliness and their imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wishes to visit Srinagar and it is a big thing to get such a boost to cleanliness there.
And I am glad that he has not only made the Bill a brand ambassador but it has also given a cart, a definition to it. And he goes to other areas also to educate people for cleanliness, inspires them and lags behind till the time the results come out.
Billal Dar is a young man, but is a source of inspiration for everyone who is keen on cleanliness.
This month of October is a month for us to remember many great men.
These dignitaries gave us direction, led us, guided us and suffered a lot for the country in the 20th and 21st century.
2nd October marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastriji, 11th October marks the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and 25th September marks the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
Nanaji and Deendayal ji are also centenary years.
And what was the central point of all these great men
One thing in his life was common and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not just to preach but to guide the people through his conduct in his life.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji were all such great men who stayed away from the shackles of power but lived a life full of people's lives, were stunned and continued to do something for the welfare of the people.
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political life and joined Gramodaya. And today, as we celebrate his centenary year, it is very natural for him to respect the work of Gramodaya.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji spoke to the youth, Nanaji always talked about the rural development of Deshmukh.
And he himself went to the village to see Nanaji's work.
Remembering all these great men is not a favour to him. Remembering these great men because we keep getting the path ahead, we keep moving forward.
In the coming Mann Ki Baat, I will surely mention Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the Run for Unity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme will be organized across the country.
In every city of the country, every city should have Run for Unity programmes at a very large scale and this season is also such that it is necessary to gain immense strength like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb united the country.
We should also run for unity and move forward with the mantra of unity.
We naturally say: Unity in diversity, India's specialty.
We take pride in diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will repeatedly tell my countrymen of India and especially to my younger generation that we are in an awakening condition.
May it feel the diversity of India, may it touch them and feel their fragrance.
You see, these diversities of our country work as a very big school for the development of your personality.
It is a vacation, it is Diwali. There is a tendency of visiting somewhere in our country and people go as a tourist and it is very natural.
But sometimes there is anxiety that we dont see our country, we dont know the diversity of our country, we dont understand it, but we have started to select foreigners by coming under the influence of glare.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any bondage, but sometimes even look at your own house.
The people of North India will not be aware of what is in South India.
The people of western India will not be aware of what is happening in Eastern India.
Our country is full of so many diversities.
All these great men made a comprehensive visit to India.
At the outset of his work, he tried to understand India.
He tried to live India within himself.
Can we try to live and understand the different states, different societies, groups, their customs, their traditions, their dress, their food habits and their beliefs as a student
Value edition of tourism will happen only when we do not visit but as a student we try to engage them.
My own experience is that I would have got the opportunity to visit more than five hundred districts of India.
There will be more than four and a half hundred districts where I got the opportunity to interact with them. And today, when I am taking over this responsibility in India, the experience of this journey is very useful for me.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to feel the stature of the immense power of our vast India while speaking the thread of unity in diversity.
It includes the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many diversities are there in food .
Even if you keep eating a different type of food daily for the entire life then no food will ever be repeated .
This is the strength of our tourism.
Remember the diversity of the people of Kotikoti.
This experience will enrich your lives.
The scope of your thinking will be huge.
And who could be a greater teacher than experience
Generally, the period from October to March is mostly of tourism.
People travel.
I am confident that if you go this time too, you will take my mission forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences and photos.
You must send your photographs on Incredibleindia (Heshtag Incredible India).
Photos should be sent not only to the buildings but also to the people there.
Not only natural beauty, but also its peoples lives.
Write good essays of your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about that
If all the people of one state talk about it then I will say to the government that it should be fulfilled and the publicity literature should be prepared on the common seven things that have come about every state.
That is, in a way, it is my objective to encourage tourist destinations from the point of view of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an important role in enhancing the tourism potential of the country by using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch me too.
It agitates my heart.
I leave a deep impression on my mind.
However, I am also a person like you.
You might have noticed that there is an incident of the past days and we have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has emerged in this young age what will be their state of mind .
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfil his husbands dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband, Rakesh Dubey, worked as a hero in the army and became a martyr for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided to join the army.
Its very natural for every countryman to respect our maternal power and those brave-hearts.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
He has given a new inspiration and a new consciousness to the people of the country.
Many congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Navratri and Diwali is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
We are also hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
I am confident that football will be spread all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
There should not be any school or college ground in India where our youngsters are not sports-oriented.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives when the whole world is playing on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is an occasion to worship Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere is full of sacred fragrance.
All around there is a spiritual atmosphere, the atmosphere of festivals, the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is celebrated as the festival of Shakti.
It is known as Shardi Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Mother Shakti that our country should scale new heights to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country will have the ability to deal with every challenge.
When the country will progress at a rapid pace and when India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022 then the efforts to fulfil the dreams of those people who had struggled for independence should be the resolve of those hundreds of crores of people, we should come out with a rod map of five years to fulfil those resolutions by working hard and relentless men.
My best wishes to you all.
Festivals are also celebrated and encouraged.
Mann Ki Baat August 2019
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, when violence is detected from any corner of India, it is natural for the country to have anxiety.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the country of Sardar Patel who devotes all the strength to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, non-violence and equal respect.
Ahimsa Param Dharma: We have been listening to it sincerely.
I had also said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of belief, be it communal beliefs, be it faith in political ideology, be it faith in that person or be it faith in that tradition.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us, has every kind of system of justice for every person.
I want to assure the countrymen, whoever passes Daman for the cause of violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate and will never tolerate any government.
Everyone will have to bow before the law, the law will decide the responsibility and punish the culprits.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and because of our thousands of years old cultural heritage, cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions, there will be hardly any day left for 365 days, which we may not be associated with any festival there.
It may be remarkable that every festival of ours runs according to the timelines of nature.
It has a direct relation with nature.
Our corn festivals are directly related to the farmers and the fishermen.
Today, when I am talking about festivals then first of all I would like to call you Mishmai Dam.
Yesterday, the festival of Santsari was celebrated in the Jain community.
Parushan Parv is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in Jain society.
The last day of the festival is Sanvasari Day.
This is indeed a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way, it is also called the 'Pakma-Vani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other lustful.
In his drama The Merchant of Venice, Gramspeare has written the significance of forgiveness: Mercy is twice blast, It blessed him and his forgiveness both receive the blessings of God.
Balangadhar Lokmanya Tilak had born this tradition 125 years ago and became a symbol of the freedom movement before independence, 125 years ago.
And since independence, he became a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi continues for 10 days.
This Mahaparv is called the symbol of unity, equality and defecation.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to every Indian.
Onam is being celebrated in Kerala recently.
One of the colourful festivals of India, Onam is a major festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival not only conveys the message of love and harmony but also instills new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that just like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in this direction
A few days later, the festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country in the series of festivals.
Id-ul-Juhani greetings to every citizen.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us but also a symbol of cleanliness of festivals in New India.
Festivals and cleanliness are associated with family life.
Cleanliness is a vote for the preparation of festivals.
This is not a new thing for us but it is also important to be a social nature.
Publicly, the call for cleanliness should become an unbreakable component of cleanliness in our country, not only in our homes but also in our entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is changing.
Just a while ago, a new dimension, a new parameter, how many cultures and how modern you are, how modern your thought process is, it is also working to know everything and that is how aware you are about the environment.
If it is against it, it is considered bad in the society today.
And as a result of this thing today, I can see that some big campaign has been started in the Ganesh festival.
If you go to YouTube then you will see that every household is constructing Ganesh ji, every household is producing Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of Environment Consciousness has been seen in the Ganesh festival, which was rarely seen before.
Media houses are also training, motivating and guiding people for the idols of eco-friendly Ganesh in large numbers.
And as I said, our country is full of crores of vibrant minds.
And it looks very good when some new innovation is detected.
Someone told me that there is a gentleman who is an engineer himself, who collects soil in a specific way, combinates it and trains people to make Ganesh ji.
And if there is immersion of Ganesha in water then it takes one doll of water and keeps it so that it dissolves in water immediately.
Three years ago when Swachhata Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are visible.
Coverage of toilets has reached approximately 6 from 3.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water subsided after the flood situation, so much waste was spread everywhere.
At this time, the workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods in a phased manner.
Everyone who sweated himself came out.
Every worker of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind gave the example of unity for cleanliness.
Dedicated efforts towards cleanliness, if it becomes our sustainable nature then where can our country reach
Let us look for opportunities wherever we get the opportunity.
But let us all join.
Work together on a holiday or Sunday.
Go to the neighbouring villages, but do it as a movement.
in, where after construction of toilets, you can enter your name and the name of that family, which is helpful in providing it.
Friends of my social media can run a constructive campaign and the work discussed in the virtual world can become an inspiration to respect the ground.
The Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi competition from Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi is an essay competition for you, a competition to make short films, a painting competition.
In this, you can write essays in different languages and they do not have any age limit, no leg-limit.
You can make short films and make them with your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that will inspire you for cleanliness.
It can be in any language, it can also be silent.
Those who will participate in this competition and those who will be selected in the best three, three on the district level and three on the state level will be given the awards.
So I invite everyone to join you in this form of cleanliness campaign.
Once again I would like to say that this time, on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti, take a pledge to observe Swachhta as 2nd October and for this, from 15th September, the mantra of Swachhta Hi Seva should be taken to every household.
Take some steps for cleanliness.
Be a participant in this endeavour.
You see, this 2nd October will shine on Gandhi Jayanti.
You can imagine how a sacred joy will be within us to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on October 2nd, after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, today I particularly acknowledge your bonds.
I would like to express my gratitude to you all from the depths of my heart. That is why you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long but I would like to express my gratitude and accept the loan because lakhs of people from all corners of the country are joining this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people write to me sometimes, sometimes the message sends, sometimes the message comes on the phone which is a big message for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your messages more than your wait to hear Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes things become such a part of our habit that we dont feel that we are making a mistake.
Prime Minister, I am calling Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about one of my good wishes.
He always keeps trying to help people but I am disturbed by one habit of it.
Once I went to the mall to shop with it.
He spent 20000 rupees comfortably for one sari and the autorickshaw that he had taken to go to the mall for Pitzha, he spent a lot of time with the rickshaw driver for five rupees.
While returning, they bought vegetables from the road and again saved four-five rupees on every vegetable.
I felt very bad.
We pay big bills without asking big locations at one go and fight for a few rupees with our brothers and sisters who live by labour.
Do you not think that whenever we come here to sell some commodity around our house, whenever we come in contact with a small shopkeeper or a seller of vegetables or an auto rickshaw driver then whenever we come in contact with the people who live by working hard, we start embracing emotions or not only reduce the cost of two rupees or reduce it by five rupees.
And whenever we go to some big restaurant to eat, we dont even see what is written in the bill and we pay the money immediately.
Moreover, even when you go to buy a sari in the showroom, you dont even engage in a feeling but you cant keep yourself in touch with the poor.
Have we ever wondered what would happen to the poor
The question is not of two-five rupees but it hurts his heart that you are the poor and hence he doubted his honesty.
There is no difference in your life for two-five rupees, but have you ever thought that these small habits of yours will have a deep impact on his mind
Madam, I am grateful to you and have conveyed a message to me by calling a phone that touches your heart.
I believe that my countrymen too will leave if they have a habit of dealing with the poor.
My dear young friends, the entire country celebrates 2nd August as National Sports Day.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the great Hockey Player and Hockey Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unprecedented.
I recall this thing because I want the new generation of our country to connect with sports.
Sports is a part of our lives.
If we are among the youngest countries in the world then our youngsters should also be seen in the field of sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness, personality announcement, I understand what more should be needed than this
In a way, sports is a very big herb of heart fairs.
And today in the computer era, I also want to warn that the flying field is more important than the play-station.
Please show FIFA RAMO on computer, but sometimes in the field too, with football.
You will be playing cricket on the computer but playing cricket under the sky in the open field is a bit special.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and the mother used to ask them - when will they come back
Today, the situation is such that a child starts watching a cartoon movie in one corner as soon as he comes home or he gets stuck on the mobile game and then he has to say - when will he go out
There was a time when the mother used to tell the child when she would come and today the situation is that the mother has to say - when will she come out
Friends, The Ministry of Sports has set up a Sports Talent Search Portal to explore and refine sporting talent where any child in the country who has achieved some achievement in the field of sports can upload his biodeta or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to the selected sportspersons.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world to this festival of sports, to acknowledge sports and to create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I would like to share with my fellow countrymen who became a touching incident last night.
I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of very young age and some of them are born in the Himalayas.
The courage and courage of the six daughters of our country who have never had a relation with the sea is an inspiration for all of us.
These six daughters, a small boat, will be ready to cross the sea with INS Tarini.
The expedition has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will return to India after months and months after travelling all over the world.
Sometimes you spend 40-40 days simultaneously in water and sometimes you spend 30-30 days in water.
This is going to be the first event in our six daughters and the world in the midst of the waves of the sea.
Which Indians should not be proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have told them that they will share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read everybody from the point of view of this thing, because this is a brave story, this will be the story of Swan-Bhavani and I will be happy to convey to you the story of those daughters.
My best wishes to these daughters. Many congratulations.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we celebrate Teachers Day.
Our former President, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji on his birth anniversary.
He was the President but presented himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
The great scientist Albert Einstein had said - "It is the superme heart of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
It means creative emotions and enjoyment of knowledge among our students are the most important qualities of a teacher.
This time when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all make a solemn pledge
And when we talk about change in our country then the way the mother reminds us of the same way the teacher reminds us of the society.
Teachers have a big role to play in transformation.
Sometimes, in the life of every teacher, such incidents have emerged that their simple efforts will only be successful in bringing about a change in the lives of someone.
If we make collective efforts, we will play a major role in transforming the nation.
Let us move ahead with this mantra - Tach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
Ananya Awasthi.
I live in Mumbai and work for India Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the Financial Inclusion of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been the subject of discussion not only in India but also in economic world.
On August 28, 2014, the campaign was launched with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is being launched on 28th August, 2019 for three years.
30 crore new households have been connected with it and bank accounts have been opened.
This figure is even more than that of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that my poor brothers and sisters who are sitting on the last corner of the society within three years have become a part of the fundamentals of the country's economy. They have changed their habits, they have started moving in the bank, they have started saving money, they have been feeling the safety of money.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor people in banks.
In a way, it is the savings of the poor. It is their strength in the days to come.
And those whose accounts have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, they have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - One rupee and thirty rupees a very common premium today is a new faith in the lives of the poor.
In many families, when the poor suffered due to the insurance of one rupee, the life of the mother-in-law of the family came to an end, in a few days she got two lakh rupees.
Be it Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up scheme, Stand-up scheme - be it Dalits, tribals, women or be it the youngsters who have the desire to do something on their own, or be it the youngsters who have the desire to do something on their own, or be it the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana or be it the banks or be it the banks or be it the banks or be it the banks or be it the banks or be it the youth or be it the youth who have the desire to do something on their own.
Moreover, everyone has made a successful attempt to provide employment to one and a half people.
Just a few days ago, the people of the bank had met me, because of the Jan Dhan Yojana, because of the insurance scheme, because of the Rupay Card, they surveyed the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and many inspiring cases.
Today, there is not much time but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that MyGov has created such a problem.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and environment are having a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, Ishaan Bharat, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and some parts of Bengal have faced natural calamities due to overcrowding.
The flood affected areas are being thoroughly monitored.
A comprehensive relief operation is being carried out.
My colleagues of the Cabinet are also reaching Rubu where possible.
The State Governments are also making all efforts to help the flood victims in their own lives.
Social organizations, cultural organizations and serving citizens are also making every effort to help the people in such a situation.
Whether it is the soldiers of the Indian government, the air warriors or the people of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF), the paramilitary forces, all of them join the hearts of the people in serving the victims.
Floods make life very uncomfortable.
Teams of NDRF were deployed.
They have been made friends and have been trained on what to do and what not to do during the emergency.
Volunteers have been created. Thus, we have to learn to work in a difficult situation by creating a folk organization.
Gradually, we should also make people such a habit that we should adapt our activities according to the climate so that we can save ourselves from harm.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that more citizens of the country prepare for it than I am.
This time, so many letters related to GST have been received and so many phone calls have been received.
And yet people are expressing happiness and curiosity about GST.
And I also tell you a phone call, Namaskar PM, I speak from Gurgaon to Nitin Garg.
I have heard your address on Chartered Accountants Day and am very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax-GST was introduced in our country on the same date last month.
Can you say that the government expects to get the same results after one month or not
I would like to thank you for your thoughts.
And when a poor person writes to me saying, I am very satisfied and happy that because of GST, the prices of the poor have come down, things have become cheaper.
I was witnessing the impact of GST on transport sector.
Now the traffic of trucks has increased.
It takes less time to cut the distance.
The highways are free from traffic jams.
Earlier, due to different taxpayers, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sectors used to be used to maintain their paperwork and they had to create new godowns in every state.
However, GST which I call Good and Simple Tax.
It has, in fact, had a very positive impact on our economy and in a short span of time.
The speed at which simplified changes have taken place, the rapid changes that have been brought into one another, the new registrations have created a new faith in the entire country.
And sometimes the experts in the economy, management experts, technologists, India's use of GST in the form of a model will present it to the world.
It will be a case study for many universities of the world.
All decisions have been taken together by the States and Centre in consensus.
And this is the result that every government has a single priority that because of GST there is no burden on the plate of the poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, the Central and the State Governments involved in this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective strength.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a social reform mission.
Once again I salute crores of Indians for making such a successful effort.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
We have been listening to it since childhood in an adventurous manner and this is the reason why the 19th August, 120th August, the unbearable movement started.
Aug 1942, the uit India Movement was launched which is known as the August Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th August, the country became independent.
In a way, in the month of August, several incidents related to the Independence Day are specially linked.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of uit India Movement.
However, very few people know that the slogan of uit India was given by Dr. Yusuf Meherally.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
From 1857 to 1942, the way the people of India continued to fight and tolerate the struggle of freedom fighters, the background of that history is our inspiration for building India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias independence.
This movement had pledged the entire nation to be freed from the British Raj.
This was the time when against the British rule the Indian public opinion became a part of the uit India Movement in every corner of the country be it villages or cities or educated people, poor people or rich people.
Peoples anger was at its peak.
Millions of Indians were shaking their lives in the struggle with the mantra of Death.
Lakhs of youngsters of the country had left their education and had sacrificed their books.
The bugle of freedom had come out.
Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement on 1st August, but put all the big leaders in jail by the British Government.
And it was during that period that great personalities like Dr. Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan played a leading role in the leadership of the second generation in the country.
There are two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in the 1920s and 1942s in the Uncooperation Movement and the uit India Movement.
The outlook of the Non-Cooperation Movement was different and the situation of 42 was different, the intensity grew so much that the mantra of the death of a great soul like Mahatma Gandhi was given to him.
All these successes were peoples support and peoples power.
It was a peoples resolve, it was a peoples struggle, the whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I think that if we want to add a little bit of history then India's first freedom struggle was in 1985.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, continued in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long period has replaced the spirit of freedom in the hearts of our countrymen.
Everyone was committed to do something.
Generations have changed but resolutions have not diminished.
People came, joined, joined, went, came, joined, joined new, and the country was trying hard to uproot the British rule.
This struggle, from 1985 to 1942, created a situation for this movement that reached its peak in 1942 and the Ransinghu of the lease of India was sounded that in five years the British had to go in 14.
From 1857 to 1942, that flag of independence reached the masses of the people, from 142 to 14 years of independence, this kind of people became such a peoples life, with the success of five decisive years of accomplishment, and became the reason for the country's independence.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I would like to connect you with this myth.
We became independent in 1947, today is 2019.
It has been nearly 70 years since the governments came to power, systems changed, developed, expanded, everybody in his own way tried to liberate the country from problems.
As a result, from 142 to 14, there was a decisive five year of achievement.
I see that from 2019 to 2022, a period of five years has come to us from Sankalp se Siddhi.
This 15th August, 2019 will be celebrated as a Sankalp Parv and when it will be 75 years of independence in 2022, we will be able to transform that pledge into accomplishment.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolves.
As the five years from 142 to 14 became decisive for the country's independence, these five years could be decisive and constructive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
Let us run a massive campaign of Sankalp se Siddhi in the month of August.
Every Indian, social organisation, local bodies, schools, colleges, separate organisations should make some resolutions for every New India.
We will make a solemn pledge in the coming five years.
Today, I am especially online because we may or may not be there, but we can definitely be online.
I invite the online world and especially my young friends and young friends to come forward to make an innovative contribution in building a New India.
Using technology, bring about all these things like video, posts, blocks, writing and innovation.
May this movement transform into a mass movement.
uit India quiz will also be launched on the Narendra Modi App for young friends.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of freedom struggle.
I believe that you must propagate and spread it.
Its not a single person who speaks, a voice of 1. 25 billion Indians echoes from the Red Fort.
This time also I invite you to send your thoughts on MYGOV or on the Narendra Modi App.
I have read it myself and I will try to disclose the time that I have on 15th August.
I have heard a complaint in my speech on 15th August for the last three times that my speech gets a bit longer.
You can see whether success is achieved or not.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to say one thing.
There is a socio economics in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just occasions of joy and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a mission of social reform.
But with this, our festivals have a direct relation between the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
Just a few days later, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganesh Utsav, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaudas, Durga Puja, Deepawali, one after the other, is the right time when the poor gets the opportunity to earn money.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months prior to Raksha Bandhan, Raksha Bandhan starts manufacturing in small domestic industries in hundreds of families.
Hundreds of thousands of Raksha Mantris, Raksha Bandhans, sweets are associated with one festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters goes on with this.
We light a lamp in Diwali. Not only this, it is not just a festival but it is also a house decoration.
It is directly related to the poor families who make small soil lamps.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
And sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, continuous environmental awareness has written to me.
And he has urged you to quote the Ganesh Chaturthi eco-friendly Ganesh in the past so that people can plan the Ganesh selection of the soil from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to such awakening citizens.
He has urged me to speak on this issue before time.
This time, the Ganesh festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of the Ganesh festival.
Once again, let us organize essay competitions, conclaves and recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak in this years Ganesh festival.
And again, in the direction of Tilak ji's feelings, let us strengthen this feeling of how to take the public Ganesh festival and at the same time let us make a solemn pledge to protect the environment from eco-friendly Ganesha.
And this time I have said very soon
I am confident that all of you will join me and this will benefit from this thing that the poor workers, the poor artists, those who make idols will get employment and the poor will get a fillip.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect with the economy of the poor, enjoy our festivals as an economic festival of the poor, as an economic festival of the poor and as an economic pleasure.
I convey my best wishes to every countryman for many festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that be it education sector, economic sector, social sector or be it sports, our daughters are making the country proud and attaining new heights.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
Our daughters have performed well in the Womens Cricket World Cup recently.
I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters this week.
I was very pleased to talk to him but I was feeling that the world cup could not be won.
There was pressure and tension on their faces too.
We have seen many such sports that if the Indian sportsperson fails in it then the anger of the country falls on those players.
Some people break the boundary and say such things, write such things that cause a lot of pain.
But this was the first time that when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup then 1. 25 billion Indians took care of that defeat and did not let their daughters fall on their wives.
Not only this, these daughters have praised them and glorified them.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, is doing a lot to illuminate the country.
Once again I heartily congratulate and convey my best wishes to the young generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, I once again remember the August Revolution and I once again remember the 15th August, 2022, the 75th year of independence.
Let every citizen of India make a solemn pledge and prepare a five year roadmap to realise his dream.
We all have to take this country to new heights, to new heights and to take it to new heights.
Let us walk together, let us do something.
Let the fortunes of the country continue to be good and let them move forward with confidence.
Many congratulations.
The weather is changing.
Rainfall has made the weather pleasant in many parts of the country.
After the rains, there is a feeling of relief due to heat falling in the cold winds during the last few days.
And we have seen that there are a lot of problems in our lives, whatever kind of stress, what kind of stress, what kind of personal life, whether it is public life or the arrival of rain changes our mood.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and happiness in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannathji.
Those who are present here today are Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar must have studied. He must have seen that he praised the temple and its traditions of Lord Jagannath ji because it included social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath ji is the God of the poor.
And very few people would know that there is a word in English language, Jugnernaut and it means such a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And it is also reflected in the direction of this generation that this word has emerged along with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen and bow down to Lord Jagannath ji in Shri Charanas.
India's diversity is also its specialty. India's diversity is also India's strength.
People of Ramzan celebrated the holy month of Ramadan with idols.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
On this occasion of Idul Fitr, my best wishes to everyone on behalf of me.
The month of Ramzan is the month of the holy ritual .
It is a month to share happiness and happiness increases as much as we share.
Let us collectively take inspiration from these holy festivals and share the treasures of happiness and move ahead with the country.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came across an inspiring incident in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Around three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in a small village. In a way, there are other Muslim brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to construct toilets together.
And this individual toilet also provides assistance from the government and nearly one lakh rupees have been given to them.
You should spend Rs. 1 lakh for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for turning this auspicious occasion of Ramzan into a good occasion for the society.
Each of their objects is also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
We know that there are three regions in our country - Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala - which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I am particularly grateful to the administration, administration and people of these five states for completing this work.
We are very well aware of the fact that if something is to be done in the life of an individual, if something is to be done in the life of a society then we have to work hard.
If our letters are bad, if we want to improve them then we have to strive for a long time with a lot of awareness.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
The theme of cleanliness is similar.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
Our habits have become part of our habits.
We have to constantly strive to get rid of it.
Everyone will have to draw attention.
We have to remember good inspiring events.
And I am glad that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the last few days, I came across an excellent event which I would like to tell you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration of that place has taken up a massive task with public participation.
100 Hour Non-stop Campaign.
And what was the target
Construction of 10,000 household toilets in 1 Gram Panchayats in a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the government together have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 villages were ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in the governance system, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district for giving a very inspiring example of hard work.
These days, I keep receiving people's response in Mann Ki Baat, on Narendra Modi App, on MyGov.
in, keeps on coming from letters, keeps on coming to Akashvani.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has recalled the Emergency that he has presented 25th June as an era in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathis democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was a dark night that no democratic loving person can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into jail.
The opposition voice was suppressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Jayaprakash Narayan were jailed.
Even the judicial system could not escape the shadow of that terrible face of the crisis.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
Todays journalists, the students of the world, the people who work in democracy, they keep on recalling the dark ages, they keep on striving hard to create awareness about democracy and continue to do so.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
A year after the Emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem and he described the mood of that time in his poetry.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of raising his head in the world today.
The entire world became Yoga Day on June 21, 2019.
From water to mountains, people welcomed the rays of sun through yoga in the morning.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practiced Yoga at The Great Wall of China in China, people performed Yoga at the height of 2400 meters above sea level at Machu, the world heritage site in Peru.
People performed Yoga at Eiffel Tower in France.
More than 40000 people performed mass yoga in Abu Dhabi, UAE.
In Afghanistan, India gave a new respect to India's friendship by practicing Yoga at the Afghanistan Friendship Dam - Salma Dam in Hairat.
In small places like Singapore, programmes were held at 70 places and they continued their campaign for weeks.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters were organised at UN Headquarters.
Everyone including UN officials, diplomats of the world participated in it...
This time once again Yoga has also worked as a World Record.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by performing Yoga together in Ahmedabad.
I also got the opportunity to attend Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time, I was fortunate to do Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen where the minimum temperature is 20,25,40 degree Celsius.
Be it our Armed Forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, everybody has made Yoga a part of their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations because it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had asked the three generations of the family to share the photos of Yoga.
Some TV channels also carried forward the same.
I got a lot of photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that recently in Kerala, we had heard in your speech that instead of giving away gifts and flower bouquets at different places, we should give us books worth reading as mementos.
You people have started this work in Gujarat during your tenure. However, Saheb, we have not been able to see this thing in a few days.
So can we do this
A reading day and a reading month is celebrated to create awareness among people about reading books, reading days and reading months.
That is why I got the opportunity to visit this place on the occasion of its launch.
And the handloom of Khadi will also encourage Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, that was the habit of all of us, but after coming here I had lost that habit.
However, once again it was remembered in Kerala.
And I have recently started giving the following information to the government:
We can also gradually develop a nature.
And the age of bouquet of flowers is very low.
Once we took it in our hands and then we put it in our hands.
But if we give the book then in a way it becomes a part of the household, it becomes a part of the family.
Welcome to Khadi by giving a pledge, how many poor people help it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is used in true sense.
And when I am saying this thing then what is the historical value of such things
When I went to UK last year, ueen Elizabeth of Britain had invited me for a meal in London.
Though many years have passed since, ueen Elizabeth has preserved the memorial given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was watching, he had requested me to touch him.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that habits do not change overnight and when we talk like this then we also have to become a victim of criticism.
Yet, there will be criticism, but if we talk about it then gradually change will come.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister there are several types of works.
I have to stay lying in files but I have become a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and that is why I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come, different types of people write letters.
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter. I feel that I must tell you about it.
Arulmoji Sarvanan, a housewife from Madurai, in Tamil Nadu, far and wide, sent a letter to me.
And in Chitti, he wrote that I thought of taking some economic activity as well as focusing on the study of children in my family, which would provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took the money from the bank through the Mudra Yojana and started a small work towards supplying the goods from the market.
I came to know that the Government of India has created a system called Survey e-Marketplace.
So I came to know about it and asked the people about it.
Then I myself got registered in it.
I would like to tell the countrymen that if you get the opportunity, you should also visit the e-GeM on the internet.
Those who want to send supply of goods to the government, those who want to send small items, those who want to send electricity bulbs, those who want to send dustbins, those who want to send a chair, those who want to send a table, those who want to sell their names can register their names on that site.
They can write down the quality of the goods they possess, how many he sells and how many people from the government departments will be compelled to visit the site and see who gives it cheaper by not restraining the quality of the supply.
And thereafter they have to be ordered.
So every department of the government looks at those who register their names within the e-GeM.
Because of the absence of intermediaries, goods get very cheap.
Now the Arulmozy Madam has registered all the goods that could be delivered on this website of the government.
And the funny thing is that the letter he wrote to me is very interesting.
He has written that one thing that I got money from Mudra, my business started, what I can give within the e-GeM and what I might have received from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office bought two thermos from me.
And I got my bill of 1600 rupees.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
There is transparency and empowerment as well as entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace - GeM.
I would definitely like those people who want to sell their goods to the government in this manner should get more and more connected to this site.
I believe that this is a wonderful example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance. And what is the goal of this Minimum Government and Maximum Governance
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga while on the other we also feel proud of our achievements in space science.
And that is the speciality of India that when our feet are on the ground with Yoga then our dreams are to be fulfilled in far-flung homages.
A few days ago, India has worked very hard in sports and science.
Two days ago, ISRO launched a 30-nano satellite with Cartosat-2 series satellite.
And this satellite includes about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA besides India.
And this Neno Satellite Campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, farmers and in times of natural calamities.
A few days ago, we must remember that ISRO successfully launched GSAT-1.
And this is the most weighted satellite that India has so far launched.
And when the newspapers of our country compared their weight to the weight of their elephants then you can imagine how our scientists have done in the field of space.
1st June marks the completion of one thousand days of the Mars Mission.
But I am glad that the efforts of our scientists have been successfully completed for six months and now our Mangalyaan Mission is working even after one thousand days.
Photos are being sent, information is being given, SANTIFIC data is coming, it is working even more than its lifetime.
The completion of one thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey, in our space journey.
In the field of sports as well, the interest of our youth is on the rise.
It is now visible that along with studies, our younger generation is witnessing its own destiny in sports as well. And because of their hard work and achievements, the country is also brightened.
Recently, India's badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth has made the country proud by putting an end to his victory in Indonesia Open.
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
Ushaji was given the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics.
Sports also plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is immense in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If even children in our family are interested in sports then they should be given the opportunity to play.
They should not be compelled to do books by lifting them from the fields, by closing them in the rooms, they should not compel them to study, they should also move forward. However, if they are capable of sports, if they are interested in sports then everybody should give courage, encouragement and encouragement to them.
Everyone should keep dreams for the current Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of festivals and festivals, in a way the experience of this period is unique.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
We are waiting for the rain dread.
Today, as I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the auspicious month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Ramzan attaches great importance to prayer, spirituality and donation.
We Indians are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can take pride in that. We 1. 25 billion Indians can take pride in the fact that all the world's sects are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God also live and those who deny God live, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship also live.
We have absorbed the art of living in harmony with all kinds of thoughts, be it religion or be it religion or be it religion or be it ideology or be it tradition or be it the message of peace, unity or harmony.
This month of Ramzan will surely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
Once again I convey my best wishes to everyone.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and specially asked the youngsters to do something new, come out of the Comfort zone.
Take new experiences, and this is the age when life can be lived in this manner, some dangers can be taken, some problems can be invited.
I am happy that many people have responded to me.
Everyone showed me the courage to speak personally.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
My reading habit was almost exhausted.
Therefore, I decided to study in these vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles and sacrifices had to be made for India's independence, how many freedom fighters spent years in jails.
I am inspired by the fact that Bhagat Singh has done a lot of things at a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to todays generation in this regard.
I am glad that the younger generation is enquiring about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
Innumerable great men, who spent their youth in jails, and in the midst of many young people, laughed and laughed.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
One thing we must have seen that the great men who spent their time in the freedom movement, had done a great job of writing, studying and ensuring India's independence.
I visited Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
He visited the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote the book "Mazi Janmashth" in the jail.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were closed in small coats.
Just imagine the tortures that those who seek freedom must have taken place.
When I read Savarkar ji's book "Maji Janmath", I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show and it is very inspiring.
There was no state of India that could not speak any language of India which did not pay any hesitation to the youth in this Cellular Jail, in the jails of Andaman and Nicobar Islands for their freedom and black water.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, who spoke every language, every region and every generation of the people from all over the country had tortured the British.
I will definitely tell the youth of the country what kind of hardships people had to face, what kind of hardships they had to face for the freedom that we had got when we visited the Cellular Jail.
Only after visiting that place one realizes why the punishment of black water is called, if you get the opportunity then in a way this pilgrimage centre of our freedom struggle must be visited.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Joining Nature means nurturing a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
It means that we should take care of the world which is not required. It is our duty to take care of it.
If you are tired and if you open the windows of your room, if you fill your breath with fresh air then you will get a new consciousness.
When it comes to this contact with the five great personalities, a new consciousness emerges in our body.
All of us have done this experience but we dont reflect on it, we dont associate it in one thread, in one thread.
After this you must realise that whenever you are in touch with the natural condition then there will be a new consciousness within you. Therefore, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should also be made.
And we are getting some benefits from the protection of environment by our ancestors.
If we protect, our future generations will benefit.
In Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the roots of power.
And the Atharvaveda is, in a way, the greatest guiding volume of the environment and written thousands of years ago.
We say Mother Earth: Sons Ahm Prithviya: The Vedas say that the purity that we have in us is due to our planet.
The earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is certainly revealed that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the attainment of knowledge and the attainment of his Mahaparinirvana, all the three trees had fallen down.
But we need to connect it with modern logic in modern words.
These days, I get news from the states.
In almost every state, a massive plantation drive is underway as soon as it comes to rain.
Crores of trees are planted.
My dear countrymen, June 21st has now become a known day for the world.
The entire world considers it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has spread across all corners of the country.
On the one hand, when there are many diversities of diversity in the world, Yoga is India's greatest gift to the world.
We have linked the world with one formula through Yoga.
Just as Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle and running around, due to increasing responsibilities and stress-free life is becoming increasingly difficult.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also coming in the lives of young people.
Yoga plays an important role in keeping medicines and leading a stress-free life at such times.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga if one has to experience the journey from oneself, mind, body, thoughts and behavior to health.
Just two days ago, I had written to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga.
Gradually, the work will progress in that direction.
This is the third International Day of Yoga and I have asked you to urge three generations of one family to perform Yoga together on the occasion of 3rd International Day of Yoga.
Be it grandparents or grandparents, parents or daughters or daughters, all the three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
If such a good coincidence takes place yesterday, today and tomorrow then Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for the suggestion and I also feel that just as we people started the campaign with selfie with the doctor, it was a very sad experience.
These three-generation Yoga dramatic pictures will surely generate fun for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Practice is being done today.
I will continue to post some or the other Yoga related posts on Twitter from June 1st and will continue to post till June 21st.
I'll share with you.
You should also propagate and spread the subject of Yoga for three weeks, please join people.
In a way, this is a movement of preventive health care.
I invite all of you to join me.
Because I got a very interesting phone call and perhaps I didn't think of it like this.
But I am grateful to him for the way he took it.
You will also get to know about this phone call.
Namaste Modi Ji, I am Naina from Mumbai.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, on your call people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
The campaign that you had taken for cleanliness from the banks of Kashi has now taken the form of a movement by taking inspiration from you.
Your fact is that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but during these days there is also a festival of sanitation in the society.
Seven days prior to my visit, several cleanliness programmes are being organised ten days ago.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how happy I would be to know that the country is also taking care of these things very beautifully.
During my journey, the topic of cleanliness is linked. What could be more joy for me than that
There will be other preparations to be made to welcome the Prime Minister but cleanliness will be the key factor.
This is also a source of joy and inspiration for any Swachhta lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have helped in the cause of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion is to spread a little bit of romance.
I dont know whether I can do it or not.
Modi ji, tell those who want to invite you before your visit, brother, if you want to invite me, what will be the level of cleanliness
The idea was very good, but I had to think.
However, it is true that the movement should be initiated that it would be better to give away other things as gifts so that we donate so many tons of waste and donate it in the form of gifts.
We can stop many people from getting sick.
What a big task of humanity will be.
One thing I would like to say is that the garbage that is waste should not be considered as waste. This is a wealth and a source.
Do not just look at it as a waste.
The Government of India has decided to launch a major drive of waste management with the help of State Governments as well as with the help of city public representatives.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities in the country are going to be able to augment solid waste and liquid waste.
There will be two types of dustbins, one of green color and the other of blue color.
There are two types of wastes - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we remain in discipline, where we have to plant garbage in those four thousand cities, we put dry wastes in blue waste and wet wastes in green waste, like the garbage that is mixed with kitchens, vegetable skins, waste food, egg peels, tree leaves, all these are wet wastes and wet wastes.
This entire activity can be used in the fields, the color of the fields is green and if you remember it then you will be able to remember what waste will be put in the green dustbin.
And the remaining wastes like rubbish paper, cardboard, iron, glass, textiles, plastic, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals, and many other useless materials are called dry waste which is required to be recycled in machines.
A few days ago, you must have heard a news that Versova Beach, which is considered dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean Versova beach today.
Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV) took over its full responsibility.
I convey my best wishes to Shri Afroz Shah.
Greetings to this movement.
And the way they connected the people of the entire region like the folk songs and converted them into mass movements is indeed an inspiring example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, months, newspapers, TV or social media, all these things have been going on for three years of the present government.
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I consider this process as a very positive sign.
This three year term has been judged on each criterion.
People from all walks of life have reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I clearly believe that the governments should be responsible in a democracy and the public should be guided by their actions.
This churning is essential for an awakened nation, for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am a common citizen just like you. And as an ordinary citizen, the impact of every good or bad thing falls on me just like it affects the minds of an ordinary citizen.
Some people criticize him politically but after such a long experience, I realize that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I had never thought that Mann Ki Baat programme would make me a member of every Indian family.
It seems as if I am sitting in the house in the midst of my family and talking about my house.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me these things by writing.
And as I said, as an ordinary person, I have an impact in my mind.
Two days ago at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Madam, everyone inaugurated an analytical book of Mann Ki Baat which, as an individual, as an ordinary citizen, is encouraging for me.
I am grateful to Abdul Saheb.
My dear countrymen, by the time I meet, the rains will have started in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have changed, the start of the schooling will start from Newsar and with the rains, a new fragrance and a new fragrance will emerge.
Let us move ahead with love and affection for nature in this environment.
I extend my best wishes to you all.
Most of those who try to reach me are those who actually do something or the other in their lives.
And when it came to mind, I realized that this suggestion is not normal, it has come out of the threshold of experience.
I had never imagined that today the youth of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been familiar with the work done by some social organizations for years, but the youngsters of my country are engaged in it.
Many have sent widows to me.
There are several places where Roti Bank runs.
People deposit bread on their behalf in this roti bank, collect vegetables and they also get it from there.
Those who give satisfaction also, those who take it never have to look down.
This is an example of what kind of work is being done with the help of society.
Today is the end of the month of April.
Gujarat and Maharashtra are the foundation day of the first May.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States have contributed to the development of the country by contributing to scale new heights of development.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when Climate Change was the subject of education and the subject of symposium. But today, in our everyday life, we also experience it and express our sympathy.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The heat that takes place in our country in May-June this time came in March-April and when I was getting people's suggestions about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me most suggestions on what should be done during this summer season.
Likewise, all the things are prevalent, not new, but the time when it comes to reminiscence is very useful.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.

Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for the birds.
Friends have said that water should be placed on the roof in the balcony and I have seen that the small children of the family do this job very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, then they go to see it ten times a day, whether there is water in the utensils or not and whether the birds have come or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but in fact it is a wonderful experience to spread sensitivity in the child's mind.
Sometimes you also feel a little bit of emotion with animals and birds but this feeling gives you a new pleasure.
However, it is important to strengthen such efforts in a collective manner that we are coloured with animals, birds and nature.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I used to visit the religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community Syedna Saheb for a hundred years.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He distributed approximately 52 thousand chicken pox in the world.
It was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that sometimes we get to our courtyard with printers, milk components, postmen and sometimes we forget that if there are days of goodness then we should ask for some water beforehand.
Young friends, I would like to share with you a few things.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation enjoys living in Asho-Ram itself.
Parents also breed in a defensive condition.
I am confident that some friends will certainly make efforts and will also tell me.
I have suggested three of these things that if we implement the three of them then it is very good but try to implement one of the three.
It is a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
Whenever you have not seen it, you have not thought it, you dont know it, but if you want to go there then try to go there.
New space, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in a book or listening to it from acquaintances and feeling it yourself, there is a distinction between respect and honour.
I would urge you to try and experiment with your curiosity in this vacation.
Whether it is positive or a little comfortable, please do it.
We belong to a middle class family and a happy family.
I dont ask you to do it again and again, once you feel it.
Be it evening, take your football or voluntary or any other sports equipment to reach out to the poorest of the poor.
Play yourself with those poor children, you will find the joy of sports that you have never met before.
And I am confident that if you go once you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organisations work in service.
Please find out that you are also associated with Google Guru and join such organizations for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time you might have felt that you have camped like this, you have learnt the course of personality development then you should reach out to those people who did not get the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn those people without taking the money you have learnt.
You can learn how to develop.
Every individual has become engrossed in technology.
Community is also a culture and collectivity is a force.
Today is the time for competition.
Sometimes it is fearful that our younger generation is not becoming a human-boat.
Attempts to spend time with yourself, away from technology.
Be it Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi, you are learning a musical instrument, you are learning 5-50 sentences in a new language.
How diverse is the country and if you look at it, you will find a learner in our surroundings.
You have the desire to learn car driving , do you ever have the desire to learn auto rickshaws
You have driven a bicycle but you have tried to drive a three-wheeler cycle with people.
You will see that all these new experiments, these schemes will give you joy and the life that has been tied up in a diary will also bring you out.
Do something out of box.
This is an opportunity to make a life.
And you will be wondering if all the examinations are completed and when we go to the new stage of career then that opportunity will not come.
Afterwards you will fall into other hurdles and that is why I will tell you that if you have the hobby of learning miracles then learn the miracle of your leaf.
Keep showing your warehouses.
I have said from my experience that seeing the world gives us so much learning and understanding that we cannot imagine.
This will help you learn a lot.
I would like it and it is also true that when you are going then share the pictures of it with me.
Have you seen something new
Where, where did you go
You share your experiences using Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
It is a scheme of the Government of India.
If BHIM App is downloading and you will continue to use it.
But refer the others.
And if a new person does three transactions, if an economic business is done thrice then you earn Rs. 10.
10 rupees will be deposited in your account from the government.
If 20 people were given a day, you would earn 200 rupees by evening.
Merchants can also earn and students can earn.
And this scheme is upto 14th October.
You will contribute to the creation of Digital India.
You will become a strategist for New India.
vacation and earnings.
In a way, it became a symbol of VIP culture but the experience suggests that the red light was on the vehicle, it was on the vehicle, it was on the car, but it used to penetrate into the brain and in a mental way the VIP culture was home.
No one can claim that the red light that has been inserted into the brain must have been removed.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has also expressed apprehensions in those phones, but now this phone call comes to an estimate that the common man does not like these things.
This makes it feel distant.
Namaskar PM ji, I am calling Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the red beacon light ban of the government.
I read a line in Newspaper in which it was written, Every India is a VIP on a road, I was very proud to hear it and it was also a matter of great happiness that today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in traffic jams and I don't even have to stop for anyone.
I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for this decision.
And the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that has been launched is not only cleaning our country but also clearing the VIP claims on our roads. Thank you very much.
But we have to take it out of our minds too.
If we all make conscious efforts together, we will be able to get out.
Our concept of New India is that instead of VIP, the importance of EPI will increase.
And when I am saying EPI in place of VIP then it is clear from my point of view that Every Person is Important.
Every individual has the importance, every individual has the dignity.
If we accept the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians, if we respect the dignity of 1. 25 billion Indians then how big a force will be created to fulfil the great dreams.
We have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we should keep remembering history, our culture and our traditions again and again.
We get energy and inspiration from these things.
This year we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya, 1. 25 billion Indians.
We have become so small that we think for centuries.
Century is of great importance to other countries of the world.
But India is so ancient that we have got the opportunity to celebrate the memories of thousands of years and even thousands of years old in its fortunes.
What would have happened a thousand years ago
Very few people would know that Ramanujacharya ji had fought against the social evils, the feelings of superstition, the feeling of untouchability and casteism.
Through his own conduct, the society was embraced by those considered untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he had struggled to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate that in every era great men are born from our society to end the evils of our society.
When we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramnujacharya, there is strength in the organization for social unity and inspire him to revive this feeling.
The Government of India is going to celebrate a stamp on the day of 1st May, in the memory of Saint Ramanujacharya ji.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Ramanujacharya Ji and pay my respects.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 1st May has a different significance.
It is also celebrated as a labour day in many parts of the world.
Labour is being discussed and Labours are being discussed and it is very natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the kind of facilities that the workers receive today.
Baba Sahebs contribution for the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, Saint Ramnujacharya ji, the great saint of 12th century Karnataka and social reformer Jagat Guru Basaveshwar ji is also remembered.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend a function.
It was an occasion to dedicate to the nation the storage of their lives.
In other words, Shram is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the labourers, it is very natural to remember the labourers.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha are celebrated all over the world.
The world is passing through the problems of violence, war, destruction, arms competition...
When we see this environment then Buddha's ideas seem to be very relevant.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that on this great occasion of Buddha Purnima, Vesak Day is celebrated by United Nations.
This year it is going to be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Opportunity to refresh his memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment towards South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you, most of the families in the country will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those whose exams have been completed will have a slightly light environment there and those families who are going to have an exam.
But at this time I will say that at the last moment I will listen to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
This information will be of immense use to you during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of Bangladeshs independence.
A historic battle against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this important day, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day. And I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong friend and a good friend of Bangladesh and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development throughout the region.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our collective heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One of the most interesting things about Gurudev Tagore is that he was the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1993 and the British gave him the Knighthood Prize.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh ji and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru on the gallows and we all knew that incident of 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had the satisfaction of serving Mother India there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were enshrined in the yagna of Bharati's freedom.
And these three bravehearts are still the inspiration of all of us.
We cannot imbibe the sacrificing of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Empire was afraid of these three groups.
The British used to worry about how they had to go ahead and how they had to go ahead.
And only then the hanging was done on 24th March but only on 23rd March.
The gallows were stolen, which is not usually done.
And then the British quietly burnt their bodies in Punjab today.
A few years ago when I got the opportunity to visit that place for the first time then I used to feel a different kind of wave on that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, whenever they go to Punjab, they must visit the place of the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the flame of freedom, its intensity and intensity were increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired many others for the Armed Revolution. Just a hundred years ago, on 10th April 11, Mahatma Gandhi had done the Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian thoughts were evident in India's freedom movement.
This was a major turning point in the entire freedom movement.
The Satyagraha of Champaran, the Satyagraha of the Kheda, the Satyagraha of the Milamours in Ahmedabad, especially in terms of the methods and methods of struggle, had an impact on Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and work culture.
Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a man who came back to India in 1915, only two years in office.
Neither the country knew him nor was his influence.
We can guess how hard they had to suffer at that time, how hard they had to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was one of the greatest examples of Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, the ability to examine the pulse of Mahatma Gandhis Indian society. It is a wonderful philosophy to showcase Mahatma Gandhis behaviour to unite, motivate and motivate even the poorest, the most destitute persons against British rule.
And that is why we feel the magnitude of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started public life.
We can learn from how to start public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And this is the time when we hear the names of the big leaders, when Gandhiji sent them to the villages be it Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani Ji.
People had to learn how to colour the work that was being done by people in the form of freedom.
And the British could not understand what the methods of Gandhi are. Conflicts are also going on, creation is going on and both are walking together.
Gandhi knew that he had made a coin on both sides.
Conflicts on one side of the coconut and creation on the other.
On the one hand the jail is filled and on the other hand Homi Devi herself is in creative work .
Gandhiji's work style had a wonderful balance.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be the disagreement, what is the disagreement with such a great rule Gandhi had established this whole new idea not through words but through a successful experiment.
This desire of transformation of crores of people of the country, this effort of transformation, this is the only thing that will lay the foundation for New India and New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party nor a project.
It is the feeling that 1. 25 billion Indians together want to make a grand India.
There is hope, hope and aspiration in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians. There is a resolution and a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we try to understand what is happening in our society with a sense of compassion by going away from our lives then we will be surprised to know that lakhs of people are looking at something for the society, for the oppressed, for the deprived, for the poor, for the deprived, for the distressed, for their personal responsibilities.
And he keeps on doing his penance and penance as a servant.
Many people visit the hospital everyday and help the patients.
Many people know that they run for blood donation immediately.
Many people who are hungry are concerned about their food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
This mantra of service to the people is in our blood.
If we look at it in a collective manner, if we look at it in an organized manner then we will know how powerful it is.
When it comes to New India, its criticism, its interpretation and viewing from different perspectives are very natural and it is welcome in a democracy.
But it is true that dreams of crores of Indians can be realised in front of our eyes if they make a resolve, if they decide to make a resolve and if they move ahead with each other then the dreams of New India and the dreams of crores of Indians can be realised.
And it is not necessary that all the treasures should be made from the budget only by the government projects or government funds.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will comply with the rules of traffic, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will discharge my responsibilities with honesty and commitment, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will not use petrol and diesel one day in a week then what a big change can be brought about.
It means that every citizen obeys his citizen's religion and follows his duties.
And that can be a good beginning for a New India.
My dear countrymen, today I also express my gratitude to you.
In the last few days, an environment has been created in our country and a large number of people have participated in the Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
The curiosity of how transactions can take place without cash has also increased.
Even the poorest of the poor is trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards doing business without cash.
Since demonetisation and demonetisation, there has been significant increase in various forms of digital payments.
Since the launch of the BHIM App, it has been only two-and-a-half months but now about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption. Can 1. 25 billion Indians take a pledge to do the work of digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
25 billion Indians can do this thing in six months if they want to wait for one year.
2,500 crore digital transactions will not be paid in cash, digitally filled, if we want to travel in railways, if we want to travel in airways then we will pay digitally, if we buy medicines then we will pay digitally, if we run cheaper cereals then we will make digital arrangements.
We can do this in everyday life.
You can do a great service to the country and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Several programmes have been organized for public education in the past.
It is a pledge to organize 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There was also a prize scheme.
About 12. 5 lakh people have received this reward from the customers.
0,000 people have received prizes for traders.
And everyone has pledged to take this work forward.
And as it was decided several times earlier, on April 14, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, the DigiDhan Mela will be concluded.
After completion of 100 days, a big event is going to be held at the end.
It has also been observed with very large drains.
I believe that whatever time we have saved on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, let us propagate Bhim App.
Let us contribute to the reduction in cash transactions, and to the lesser transactions.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask people for Mann Ki Baat, all kinds of suggestions come.
But I have seen that every time people have been urging for cleanliness.
I would like to talk to you about my heart.
I would like to say that people will have to understand how important cleanliness is.
Every day I pass by a river where people throw lots of waste and pollut the river.
That river flows from the bridge of Rispana to my house.
Several people have taken out the rally for the river and for several areas and have also done seven things about it but it has not benefitted.
And the good thing is that Gayatri is expressing his anger and also suggesting to me that he has made a lot of efforts but he has got a lot of failings.
Awareness has emerged as a result of the Swachhta movement.
Every individual has been positively associated with it.
It has also taken the form of a movement.
Hate towards dirt is also increasing.
Be it awareness or be it active participation or be it movement, everyone has its own importance.
But Swachhta movement is linked to habits.
This movement is a movement to change the habits, this movement is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can take place in a collective manner.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I believe that this feeling has awakened in the new generation, in children, in students and in the youth of the country and this is a sign of good results.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell the people of Gayatri that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been saying Mann Ki Baat from the beginning, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one thing and most of the people have expressed concern about the waste of food.
We know that we eat more than necessary food in our family and in community meals.
Everything that we see is taken in the plate and can not be eaten.
We cannot eat even half of the plate that we fill and leave it there.
Have you ever wondered how much we harm our food we leave.
Has anyone thought that if we dont waste food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people
Though efforts are being made to somebody, depression on this subject is a traitor.
There is injustice to the poor.
I don't urge you too much on this subject but I want to raise awareness.
Their lives inspire us not to waste food.
We have to eat as much as we want.
See, there are similar solutions for change.
And those people who are aware about health always say - keep a little stomach empty, keep some plates empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally depressed.
The problem is that there are such people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are hesitant to talk openly about them.
Those who are afflicted with depression do not say anything because they themselves also feel embarrassed about it.
I would like to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot be freed.
This requires a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, its expression is needed.
Talk to your friends, friends, parents, brothers and sisters about what you are experiencing.
Sometimes one feels loneliness and especially the students living in the hostels face more problems.
Families are big, they are mixed and there is no possibility of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that you have seen that your daughter or a daughter or any member of the family should sit with everyone and say that I will not be present, then I will go on the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If they do not like to live in groups and stay in a single corner then keep in mind that it should not happen .
This is the best solution.
And depression is the cause of psychological and physical diseases.
Like diabetes, every disease is being hosted, similarly depression eliminates our ability to sustain, fight, venture and decide.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your atmosphere can stop you from getting into depression and if you have gone, you can get out of it at the earliest.
Help your heart, share their happiness and sorrow, you will feel that your inner pain will end.
If you try to understand their sorrows and do them with utmost care then you will have a new confidence.
By connecting with others, by serving someone and serving selflessly, your mind will be lightened.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in moving towards stress-free, suppressed and happy.
21st June is International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
All of you make preparations and celebrate Yoga festivals in lakhs of numbers.
If you have any information about 3rd International Yoga Day, send me through mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetic compositions can be made about Yoga, it should be prepared so that people can easily understand it.
But along with work, women also have special responsibilities.
They also take over the family responsibilities and also support the financial responsibilities of the family, resulting in injustice to their newborn babies.
At that time, the Government of India has decided to increase the maternity leave of these employed women to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks of their pregnancy.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become the country's precious reservation.
It will also improve the health of mothers and for this it will be an important decision.
This will benefit about 18 lakh women in the formal sector.
May the lives of all these great souls continue to inspire us and fulfil the resolve of New India.
After two days Chaitra Sukal Samman, Year End Resolution, New Volunteers. Congratulations to all of you for this new year.
This is a good time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work.
New years are celebrated in different parts of the country in different forms.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only flowers, the fruits on tree branches are shining in the sun.
Fruits of summer season can also be seen in summer season .
On the other hand, the yellow flowers of mustard in the fields give hope to the farmers.
The flower of Kesuda indicates the arrival of Holi.
Emir Khusro has given a beautiful description of the moments of climate change.
Emir Khusro has written: Flowers are full of skin, bamboo fools, desu flowers, koyal ballet, darkness, when the weather is pleasant, humans also enjoy the pleasure of this season.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi shine the colors of happiness in the lives of human beings.
In an atmosphere filled with love, brothers and humanity, we are going to bid farewell to Faggan last month and we are ready to welcome the new Monsoon Chaitra.
This is a coincidence of two months.
At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for suggestions for the matter of mind then there is a clear suggestion.
I have written to DhanushJal on the NarendraModiApp that many people are not aware of the accomplishments of ISRO and hence he said, I will send 104 satellites and give some information about the Interceptor Missile.
Thank you very much, Mr. Dhanush ji, you have sacrificed the pride of India.
Whether it is poverty alleviation or prevention of diseases or be it connecting with the world or be it providing knowledge or be it delivering information or be it technology, science has made its place everywhere.
15 February 2019 is a day of pride in Indias lives.
Our scientists have raised Indias glory before the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
After the success of sending Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars, ISRO has launched a world record in space in the recent past.
And it is also heartening to note that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but for the entire India.
ISROs Coast Effective Efficient Space Programme has become a wonder for the entire world and I appreciate the success of Indian scientists across the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is extremely important.
Carto Satellite-2D is a satellite of India and will greatly help in planning urban development through drawn images, resource mapping, infrastructure and development assessment.
Particularly, my farmer brothers and sisters, our new satellite Catro-Sat-2D will help a lot in all aspects of the country's water resources and how it can be utilised.
I also sent some photographs as soon as our satellite was launched.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of happiness for us that our young scientists, our women scientists have led this entire mission.
Such a massive participation of youth and women is a proud aspect of ISROs success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of my countrymen.
The more we appreciate these scientists, the less we appreciate their team.
And that is, India has achieved a major milestone in this regard in terms of Indias security.
This thing has not been discussed in a big way today, but the attention of Dhanush Ji has gone on this important thing.
India has also successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in the field of defence.
This Interception Technology Missile, during its testing, has successfully eliminated the enemy's missile at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground.
This is a significant achievement in the field of security.
And the special feature is that if a missile comes from a distance of 2000 kilometres, India too will destroy it in space.
We feel delighted when we need new technologies and some new scientific achievement.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human lives.
And the talented Buddha does not allow curiosity to remain in the form of curiosity. He also raises questions within him, he finds new inquiries and creates new inquiries.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for innovation.
He used to sit on his feet until he got the answer.
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not complete.
Full break is impossible.
Efforts are continuously being made to know the universe, the laws of creation, the minds of mankind.
New science and new technologies emerge from it.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said this thing in my mind that our younger generation should draw attention to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific era becomes a sustainable change in the lives of generations to come.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India have planned a unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharti Diwas.
An invitation was made for social innovation.
How to recognise, demonstrate, inform and discover such discoveries for the common man, how to commercially utilize these products and how important it has been done.
Many times the problem also shows the importance of science for solving.
Mumbai received rains in 2005, floods in the sea, seas were filled with difficulties and whenever any natural calamity occurs then the first danger comes to the poor.
Two brothers worked very closely in that direction and developed a house that protects people from such calamities, saves them from drinking water and also protects them from hydrogenic diseases.
And our society also becomes technology-based.
Systems are also being made technology-driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, a lot of importance has been given to Digi-dhan.
Gradually, people are coming out of the pocket and moving towards Digitization Currency.
Digital transactions in India too are growing at a fast pace.
Especially the younger generation is getting used to making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes.
In our country, there has been a lot of support for the Lucky Consumer Scheme DGDA Business Plan in the past few days.
It has been almost two months since then 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And, through these two schemes, welcoming one of the initiatives to make Digital Payments a mass movement in India is welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of happiness that so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded under the DigiDhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have been rewarded and more than Rs.
Under this scheme, most consumers are those who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of fifty fifty thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives, students, everyone takes part in this scheme with enthusiasm.
From Mysore, Shriman Santosh ji has gladly written on the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I must tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said, I got a reward of Rs. 1,000 and at that time I came to know that a poor old woman had a fire in her house.
When the goods were burnt, I realized that the reward I have received, perhaps it was the right of this poor old mother and I gave him thousands of rupees.
You have done a wonderful job.
Everyone keeps up with this digital knowledge for a long time.
He keeps talking with enthusiasm and encourages others too.
I would urge the countrymen, particularly the youth of the country, and the Lucky Consumer Scheme or the DigiDhan Vyapar Yojana that they have received, to be their messengers.
You must take it forward and in a way it is a work of anti-corruption.
In a way, you are a soldier of morality.
You are aware that the Lucky Consumer Scheme will be completed on 14th April.
This is a memorable day.
On 14th April, a sum of prices worth Rs.
There are still forty-four-days left.
Can you do one thing by remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar .
Babasaheb Ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering them, you should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Learn how these transactions take place, and especially the small traders around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and Bhim App give special importance to it.
This movement has been going on for the past two-three months. Several townships and villages have achieved great success in several cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the roots of our economy.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic momentum of the country.
Today, I would like to tell you a lot of happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard to provide a store of food.
This year, with the hard work of the farmers, record food grains have been produced in our country.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the records of the past.
This time, crops have been soaked in the fields that it seemed that Pongal and Baisakhi are prescribed today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 percent more than the last record recorded in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I would particularly like to thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the farmers, I would also like to thank them for cultivating different pulses keeping in mind the traditional crops and the poor of the country because the poor get the maximum protein from pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country listened to the voice of the poor and cultivated pulses in about two and a half lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service to the poor people of my country done by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for the kind of hard work done by the farmers of my country by working hard on one request of me.
My countrymen, this thing keeps moving in the direction of cleanliness by the government, society, institutions, organizations and people in our country.
In a way, everyone is seen to be aware about cleanliness in some way or the other.
And it was not just a seminar in the closed rooms in the state of Telangana but also by using the importance of direct cleanliness.
A Toilet Pitt Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad from 1-18 February.
Six houses were evacuated and cleaned and officials themselves demonstrated that the pits used for twin pit toilets could be evacuated and recycled.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of the new technology are and there is no inconvenience in evacuating them, no shrinking occurs, no shrinking occurs, no shrinking occurs, no hurdles that are psychological barrier.
And we can clean a toilet pit just like that when we clean it normally.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has accorded great importance to it and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet pit then it is natural for the country to draw its attention towards it.
And the toilet pit that we consider to be waste but if we look at it from the point of view of fertilizer then it is a black gold.
We can see what is wealth from waste.
And this has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for a family of six members is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected into the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste collected in the pit gets completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handling and the most important fertilizer in terms of fertilizer is NPK.
Farmers are very well familiar with NPK.
And now Swachhta Samachar is a special event in Doordarshan.
The more these things will be illuminated, the more it will be beneficial.
Various departments in the government are also considered to be Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with Tribal Development Ministry - Tribal Affairs Ministry will give a boost to this cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also carry forward the Swachhata Abhiyan in the last two weeks in March.
We must be aware that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy and a new self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyang sportspersons at the Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held this month, India has made Pakistan proud to be the second consecutive world champion.
It is a matter of pride for the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I always believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every time we learn something from them.
Whether it is about sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anybody.
He is moving ahead with a steadfast stride and is enlightening the country with his achievements.
Our women sportspersons won the Silver Medal in the last few days at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March is celebrated as World Womens Day.
Giving importance to children in India as well as raising awareness and sensitivity towards them in the family and society.
The movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is moving at a rapid pace.
Today it is not just a government programme but it has become a campaign of social sensitivity and public education.
Over the last two years, this programme has added to the common man.
This burning issue has forced people to think in every corner of the country and has brought about changes in the thinking of people towards the old practices that have been going on for years.
It gives me great pleasure when it comes to the news that the festival is celebrated on the birth of a child.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that children and children have been banned under a special mission in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu.
More than 15 childbirths have been stopped so far.
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been connected under the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme and a lot of effort is being made to ensure that the children get their education by the district administration along with the organisation of village councils.
Under the 'Har Ghar Dastak' programme in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run to educate the girl child from village to village and from house to house.
Rajasthan has started the campaign of 'Vidyalaya of your children' and has re-enrolled the girls who had drop out in the school and started the campaign to inspire them to study again.
It means that this movement of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' has taken many forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New imaginations are linked to it.
It has been moulded as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign when we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
Friends, you get an opportunity to interact at different times in Mann Ki Baat.
I get to know a lot from you.
What is happening on earth, what is happening in the minds of the poor people, what is happening in the villages and the villages reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the last few days, we have celebrated many festivals.
Yesterday, Krishna Jayanti was celebrated all over India.
And every individual can find solutions to the current problems of Krishna's life.
One feels a sense of innovation in everything.
And that is why today when I am talking to you people, I pay attention to two Mohans.
During that period even thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakra had used his intellect, his duties and his capabilities to avoid the struggle to fight the war.
And Charkhadhar Mohan also chose such a path that he gave such a shape to the freedom fighters for the protection of human values and to strengthen the element of personality and freedom fighters. He gave such a glimpse which is a surprise to the whole world even today.
We can learn everything from the message of Lord Krishna whether it is the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling even in the midst of all changes in life.
Today, as we discuss festivals, India is preparing for a bigger festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I speak on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He gave a new dimension to human history and set new records.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Anyone, whenever and whenever required, was always present for Mahatma Gandhis service.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized the spirit of self-confidence associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, humanity, humanity and individuality were the paramount.
Whether it is Phoenix Farm in Africa or be it Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, everywhere he stressed on his unique emphasis on social enrichment, community mobility.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhiji also emphasized on organisational co-operation with the spirit of serving.
Social service and social conservation, community service and community mobilization are the same sentiments that we can bring to our lives.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the true Karnajali.
My dear countrymen,
And collectivity has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi Saddha Shatabdi include collectiveness and service.
Why shouldn't we get out of the whole castle
If we have football teams, football teams will not only play but we will also work in accordance with the ideals of Gandhi.
We can do a lot, we can collect old books and share them among the poor and spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians can have 130 crore dreams and 130 crore enterprises.
Whether it is goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and dedication, the service is done with complete dedication and that too for the sake of self-reliance, a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, Dandi is a very important turning point.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, Dandi.
I urge you to visit some or the other place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Be it Porbandar or Sabarmati Ashram or Vardhana Ashram or be it connected with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And I would like to tell you two or four persons expressing your feelings.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But one thing that I would like to share with you in this regard is very interesting.
Venice Biennale is a well-known art programme where artists from all over the world gather.
This time, the India Pavilion of the Venice Biennale has a very interesting exhibition on Gandhijis memories.
The pictures of Haripura were particularly interesting.
You might remember that Haripura in Gujarat had got the session of the Congress, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected president, that incident was also included in history.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase their art works during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose art forms enhance the splendor of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And their artistic instruments have made the Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the nearby villages of Haripura and made some artefacts depicting the life of the subsequent rural India.
Venice of precious artifacts was discussed a lot.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to making some solemn pledge from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society and for a cross country.
You will remember the sons of Mother Bharti that in the last few years we have been running the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign for nearly two weeks prior to October 2nd.
This time the mission will start from 11th September.
During the expedition, we will come out of our homes and pay our tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan.
Be it houses or streets, chowks or drains, schools or colleges, we will run a massive campaign of cleanliness at all public places.
This time, we have a special emphasis on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eliminate the use of single use plastic.
This time, on October 2nd, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate an open defecation free India but will also lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic across the country on that day.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to every citizen of small towns and to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti as a liberation from plastic waste.
2nd October as Special Day.
Let us celebrate Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti as a special Shramdaan.
I urge all the municipalities, municipalities, district colonies, rural panchayats, all the public and non-government systems, all the organisations, one citizen, everyone to make appropriate arrangements for collection and storage of plastic waste in the country.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected then they should come forward for proper disposal and settlement.
It can be recycled.
It can be made fuel.
In this way, we can also complete the safe disposal of plastic waste by Diwali.
Just a solemn pledge is needed.
There is no need to see such a thing for inspiration.
Who can be a bigger inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is a well-defined Gem of Knowledge.
We can get what we want in our lives.
My connectivity with them has come down for a while.
But earlier my connectivity was very high.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing with a Sanskrit language.
And these are the things written centuries ago, how important it is today
It is an excellent description and has said: 'Water Trini Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhashitam, Mudhai: Pashankhandshe Ratan Sanjna Pradiyaette, water, food and well-described three gems in the earth.
Stones are called gems .
Food is a very rich month in our culture.
Even so, we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborn children, as they are the foundation of the future of our society.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once something was brought to my notice.
In Nasik, Muthibhar Dhaniya has become a big movement.
In this, Anganwadi workers collect grains during the days of melting of crops.
This grain is used to cook fresh food for children and women.
In a way, the donor becomes an aware citizen, a social worker.
After that, he dedicates himself to this goal and becomes a soldier of this movement.
All of us have heard about the Anna-Prashan Sanskrit in every corner of India.
This is done when the child starts feeding fixed diet for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative that can be adopted.
In many states, people are running Tithi food campaigns.
If there is a birthday or a good day or a memorable day in the family then the members of the family go to anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food and go to school and the members of the family themselves serve, feed, share their happiness and increase their happiness.
There is a wonderful blend of service and joy.
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, the poor and the happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
September will be observed as a Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
I had never imagined that I would be able to make such a place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world.
I had never imagined how diverse things our country and the youth of the world are focusing on.
I had never imagined that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch young people from all over the world.
And it is a matter of fact that I had visited Bhutan recently.
I have seen that as a Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to visit something or the other. And because of the International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if anyone meets and sits in the world then someone starts questioning me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has organised this programme in 165 countries in their language.
Today, as the path of a global brainstorming on environment, global warming and climate change, I am sure this episode of Discovery Channel will greatly help in acquainting the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in Indias culture journey.
And in our country, people now want to know about the steps taken towards climate justice and clean environment.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me along with shrinking that Modi Ji used to say that you used to speak Hindi and Beer Grills did not know Hindi then how did you have a dialogue with you so fast
Later, it has been edited.
He asks with great curiosity.
Joe, there is no secret in this.
Many people have this question in their minds and I make this mystery public.
If you look at it, it's not a secret.
In fact, technology is being used extensively in conversations with beer grills.
Beer Grills had a small cordless instrument in his ear and he was involved in English.
However, I used to say Hindi, but it used to be English, and because of this communication became more easy and that is the case with technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me talking about the Gem Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other animals .
I have said it earlier and I strongly say it to you that you must go to Ishaan Bharat in your life.
The world within you will expand.
From the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I had urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
And that too, go to 15 such places for tourism purpose, visit them, study, take family, spend some time there and spend some time there.
A country full of diversity and diversity will fill you with diversity from within as a teacher.
Your life will expand.
Your thinking will be widespread.
And trust me that there are places within India where you will come with new zeal, enthusiasm, new zeal, new zeal and new inspiration.
Your family will also feel the same.
My dear countrymen, the concerns and concerns of the environment in India are natural.
Last month, I was fortunate to announce a population of tigers in the country.
You know how many tigers are there in India
A resolution was taken expressing concern over the declining population of tigers in the world.
It was a resolution to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But it is a New India that we make the goals achieved at the earliest.
We doubled the population of tigers in 2019.
Not only the population of tigers in India, but also the number of bulk, reserved areas and community reserves have increased.
When I was announcing the tiger population, I was also reminded of the Girna Singh of Gujarat.
When I took over as Chief Minister there, the lions' habitat was shrinking in the jungle of Gir.
Their number was declining.
We took one step after another in Gir.
It was decided to appoint Women Guards in 2009.
Infrastructure reforms to boost tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife, we talk of conservation only.
But now we have to think beyond defence and think about compassion.
Our classics have received very good guidance in this regard.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Swami Vivekanandji on September 11, 1833
The young Sannyasis of India, who snatched the human race all over the world, had left India's glorious identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekananda ji saw India, the power that Swami Vivekananda ji knew, let us try to live it.
Everything in us is there, let us come out with self confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that 2nd August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the Fit India Movement-Chust India Movement across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will look forward to you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the month of September, in the POSHAN Abhiyaan, and especially in the Cleanliness Mission from 11th September to 2nd October and on 2nd October, for a fully dedicated free movement.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, this is the same in Mann Ki Baat today.
I'll meet you again.
I will wait for your suggestions and your suggestions.
Let us all come together to make the dreams of our freedom fighters an India, to fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with zeal and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, at every level, the more important the rights are given, the more important the duties should be given.
India's democracy's car can move forward at a fast pace only on two parameters of rights and duties.
Tomorrow 30th January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On 30th January, we pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping a silent silence of 2 minutes at 11 pm.
As a society, as a country, on 30th January, we must pay our homage for 2 minutes at 11 o'clock.
It should be reflected in collectivity, determination and devotion to the martyrs.
In our country there is a natural respect for the armed forces and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards include various categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I particularly urge the youngsters who are very active in social media.
The brave men who have been honoured this time, write two good mentors related to the network and spread it among your colleagues.
When we know about his courage, valour and heroism, we are also surprised, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were all delighted with the excitement and enthusiasm of 26th January, when our soldiers in Kashmir were serving the nation, they were brave because of the avalanches.
I salute and salute all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I have been continuously doing Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are the months of choti for every family.
There is an examination of one or two children in the house but the entire family is under the burden of examination.
So I realized that this is the right time that I talked to my student friends, I talked to their friends, I talked to their teachers because for several years I had gone to see the reason for a lot of difficulty.
Family distress, student distress, teacher distress, every household has a strange psychological environment.
And I always feel like getting out of this and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in some detail.
When I made this announcement, a number of teachers, scholars and students sent me a message, sent a question, expressed pain and expressed anguish and after seeing this I came to my mind that I would like to talk to you today.
I got a telephonic message from creation.
So I would like to ask you so much that this environment cannot be happy.
The question has been asked by Christopher but this question will be in your mind.
Exams should be an opportunity of happiness on their own.
This should be a festival of excitement and enthusiasm that has worked hard throughout the year, which is now the time to show.
There are very few people for whom the exam is a matter of happiness and for most people the exam is a pressure.
It is to be decided that you will consider it a matter of happiness or pressure.
Anyone who believes in happiness will attain it and the pressure that he believes will be swallowed.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination in such a way that when there is a festival and when there is a festival then the best thing that is best in us comes out.
Festivals also exhibit the strength of the society.
Normally we feel that how misleading we are but if we look at the Kumbh Congregation for 40-45 days then we will find out what is the discipline of Make Shift Arrangement among people.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the examination, there should be an atmosphere of celebration in the family, friends and neighborhoods.
You will see that this pressure will change happily.
The festive atmosphere will be a burden-free environment.
And I would like to urge parents to create an atmosphere of festival for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months each year into festivals by understanding our traditions and the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy then you are seeing yourself relaxed and you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed then you will easily remember your old things.
A year ago, the entire sight of what the teacher had said in classroom will be remembered.
And you should be aware that the power to recall memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door is closed, not outside and not outside.
The process of thinking stops, which automatically becomes a burden.
It must have been seen in the examination that you remember everything, the book reminds us, the topic reminds me of it, the leaf ranking reminds me of it, it is written upwards in the leaf, it reminds me of it downwards.
Why was it not remembered inside, there was pressure.
But the one inside came out immediately and it came out that you became relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine for memorial recall then it is relaxation.
And I say this on the basis of self-reliance that if there is pressure then we forget our things. And if there is relaxation then we will never imagine it.
And it is not that you dont have any knowledge, it is not that you dont have any information, it is not that you have not worked hard.
But when the tension takes place then your knowledge, your information gets pressed and your tension gets over it.
And therefore it is essential that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it feels that we cannot see exams in the right perspective.
It appears that he is a question of life and death.
The examination that you are going to give is a test of your learning throughout the year.
This is not a testimony to your life.
It is not an examination of how you are living your life, how you are living your life and how you want to live your life.
In your life, there would have been an opportunity to pass through many tests in addition to the scrutiny given in the classrooms.
And that is why we should be free from the stress that there is some god to test with the success and failure of our lives.
Our former President, Dr.
a.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great inspiration.
Somebody has sent me a question: Today, if I can see the biggest challenge facing education today, education has become a centre of exams.
The qualities have become the most important.
This has not only increased the competition but has also increased the tension among the students.
So I want to know your ideas about this present direction of education and its future.
Though he has himself answered, but Dhicha ji wants me to present my views here.
Marx and Markshit have very limited use.
This is not all in life.
Life goes on on how much knowledge you have gained.
Whether you have tried to lead your lives or not, life is going on.
The sensitivity of mission that you have received, which is your sensitivity of ambitation, whether there is any correspondence between your mission or not.
If you believe in such things then Marx will be behind you, you will not have to run behind Marcus.
You will get knowledge, skills and confidence in your lives.
You tell me that one of your family members will be a doctor and every family will be close to him who is a family doctor.
None of you must have asked his family doctor how many qualities he had passed.
No one has asked me.
Brothers and sisters, you felt that as a doctor, you are benefiting and you have started serving him.
If you go to any lawyer to fight against any big case then do you see the mark sheet of this lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge and his successful journey.
And that is why these virtues which are burdened sometimes stop us from moving in the right direction.
But it does not mean that I just don't have to study.
It is necessary to use it for our testing.
It is necessary to know where I was yesterday and where I am today.
Sometimes it happens and if you look at your life from close then it will be noticed that if you fall behind the qualities then you will find a short way, you will find a few choices and you will focus on them only.
But if you focus on quality then you are gradually shrinking yourself and you limit yourself to a definite area just to get a mark.
So it may be that in spite of being skilled in the exams, sometimes life fails.
Rachaji has also said one thing - competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Indeed, competition is not used to take life forward, it is impossible to move forward. And when I am incompetent, it means competing with oneself.
How will tomorrow be better
One particular feature of the lives of most of the successful sportspersons is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar Ji.
Friends in every sphere of life, when you are examining then think that if you can study peacefully for the first two hours then you can study for three hours.
S.
Sunder ji has expressed his emotions on the role of the Valis.
He says that the role of valiant players in the examination is very important.
He further wrote - My mother was not a parent, yet she used to sit with me and tell me to be counted as a mathematician.
Because the mothers are conscious about the future of the households and are active, they make things easier.
Once you learn to accept it, most of the problems will be solved there.
Every guide must have experienced that.
Valis and teachers are at the root of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
Appointments make it difficult to wait.
Accepting the situation gives an opportunity to open new paths.
And therefore accept whatever is there.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come there and asked a single question about his health.
He did not do any such thing as what is the situation, what is the disease and what is the situation.
In the first two-four minutes, the weather was lightened.
Going to a sick person many times we make him sick.
Sometimes we do the same with our children.
Did they ever feel that during the days of examination the environment of laughter should be given to the children .
You see, the weather will change.
An amazing phone call has come to me.
Namaskar, elder Prime Minister, I cannot mention my name because I did something in my childhood.
And when I tried to imitate it then I got caught in it and because of that I had a lot of trouble with my friends around me.
You must have often heard that you don't steal a kitchen.
I also reiterate the same thing to you all.
Once there is a habit of stealing, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
You might not be able to copy the entire creativity of the examination if you prepare for it.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that arises during our exams and my second question is whether or why exams seem to be light or not.
If there is a holistic development then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Someone says that I will pass all these examinations first and then play.
So that's impossible.
So the remaining parts of the body should also get physical activity .
Have you ever imagined that whenever there is such a thing in front of you, you should come out for two moments and look towards the sky, you should look at the trees and plants, you should feel a little bit lighter.
By doing so, you will come back in your room, in your books with a freshness.
Whatever you are doing, keep it a little while, get out, go to the kitchen, look for your favorite things and if you get biscuits then eat it.
Why not just for five minutes, but take some breaks.
There is no need to stay locked in a room for deep breathing.
Just go under the open sky, go to the sky, take a deep breath of five minutes and then sit down to study again.
You will feel that the body will be very light and the body will not only become light but it will also make the brain lighter.
Some people feel that we will wake up till late at night and we will read more and more.
Definitely take as much sleep as is needed in the body .
Fresh will come.
Your efficiency will grow immensely.
Whenever I meet in the elections, I swallow my sweets.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep
He gave me a medicinal plant.
So indeed, if we understand the importance of these things then it will benefit us.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping.
Otherwise, the people of your family will be disappointed with me.
And the day your mark sheet will come, you will not see it.
The person who plays, shines is a very big medicine to keep the mind, the mind and the body cautious.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not let the burden be laid on what I have said.
I also feel that the way I advise your family and parents not to be a burden.
Remembering your resolve and believing in yourself, go for examination.
My best wishes are with you.
Make a casualties and festivals to cross the barriers.
Thereafter, there will be no proverbs.
Please take this mantra forward.
Fellow Citizens, Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is completing 40 years in February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Garden for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the worlds four largest Coast Guards with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in the country.
Last year, the people of Coast Garden, along with their responsibilities, took up a massive campaign to clean the seashores of our country and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people would be aware of the fact that not only men but women are also working shoulder to shoulder with their responsibilities in the Coast Guard.
Coast Garden is not only an Observer of our women officers but also a horcraft.
Congratulations to the Indian Coast Guard on the 40th anniversary of Indias Maritime Security today, as an important theme of maritime security has been created all over the world.
1st February is the festival of Spring Panchami.
Spring has been recognized as the best season.
It is the queen of the spring season .
Opportunity to worship Vidyalaya is celebrated.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the braves.
My color de Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Akashvani in Mann Ki Baat always looks new with her imagination.
Immediately after he had finished his Mann Ki Baat from last month, he had started reading Mann Ki Baat in regional languages.
It has received wide acceptance.
People have been writing letters from far and wide.
I congratulate Akashwani for her self-inspired work.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar (Pranam), best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is an occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Jesus said, The poor are not our favors, but we want to accept it. In St. Luke's Gospel, Lord Jesus has not only served the poor but has also explained the services done by the poor and this is true (of all, of fact) empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
It is said in the story that Lord Jesus was standing near the entrance of a temple.
There were many rich people and they donated immensely.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and gave him two copper coins as a donation.
If you see two copper coins then do not consider them very big .
It was very natural for the devotees present there to be curious.
Lord Jesus said that this lady has donated the most because all others have donated a lot but this lady has donated all her wealth.
Today is 25th December, the birth anniversary of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviya ji, who gave a new direction to modern teaching, gave a new direction to self-confidence and commitment to the Indian public.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development projects in Malviya ji's Tapobhumi Banaras.
His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre (BHU) has laid the Foundation Stone at BHU in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre will not only be a boon for the people of eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the country with success in the nuclear energy sector.
Whether it is a party leader or a member of parliament, whether it is a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has set an ideal place in every role.
I bow to Atal ji on his Jayanti and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as an officer.
A lot of memories are swimming in front of their eyes.
Today, on Christmas Day, people of our country are going to get the benefits of two schemes as gifts.
In other words, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is a village or a city, whether it is educated or uneducated, whether it is cashless, how cashless business runs, how it can be purchased without cash, there is an atmosphere of curiosity all around.
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this thing, to make mobile banking stronger, e-payment habit is going to be initiated by the Government of India, for consumers and for small traders.
One Scheme for Promotion of Consumers - Lucky Consumer Scheme and the other Scheme for Promotion of Traders - DigiDhan Business Scheme
Today, on 25th December, fifteen thousand people will be rewarded with a drone system and they will be rewarded with a prize of Rs. 1,000 each in the accounts of 15,000 people.
Fifteen thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
In 100 days, lakhs of families are going to get crores of rupees but this reward will be worthwhile when you will use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD - these digital payment methods and will be drawn on the basis of this.
With this, there will be a one-day long draw for such customers, including a reward of lakhs and three months later, Dr.
On the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there will be a bomber drove which will have a prize of crores of rupees.
DigiDhan trading scheme is primarily for traders.
Consumers should also be associated with this scheme and make their own business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and will be rewarded in thousands.
Merchants will also have their own businesses and rewards.
This scheme has been made by keeping every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class in the center. And that is why those people who purchase more than Rs. 50 and purchase less than Rs.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3000 will not get the benefit of this reward.
Even the poorest of the poor can use USSDs to buy goods through telephones, ordinary phones and sell goods and pay the money. And every person can be beneficiaries of this scheme.
People in rural areas can also buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win prizes.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize money scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youngsters around you will definitely be aware of it and you can ask them, they will definitely explain it to you.
Well, even your family will have children studying in classes 10-12, those people will be able to learn this easily.
This is very simple - the way you send WhatsApp messages from mobile phones is as simple as it is.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that the awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to do e-payment and how to make online payments is increasing at a rapid pace.
Cashless trade and cashless trade has increased by 300 percent in the last few days.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
How big this decision is, these traders can apply very well.
The traders who make digital transactions will develop online payment systems rather than cash in their businesses. Such traders have been exempted from incubation.
Everyone has taken this mission forward in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu has appointed a committee headed by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, who is considering several schemes in this regard.
But I have come to know that several state governments have initiated and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Assam Government has decided to give 10 discount on Property Tax and Digital Payment of Business License Fee.
The rural banks which will have at least two digital transactions of 5 of their subscribers during the period January-March will receive a reward of Rs. 50,000 from the government.
5 lakh under Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transaction (Uttar Panchayat for Digital Transaction) by Government of India upto 31st March, 2019.
Under the Digital Farmer Shiromani scheme for farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a prize of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, who will be able to avail digital payments for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to every government that has started such a beginning.
Several institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital shopping among the rural poor farmers.
I am aware that GNFC - Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Chemicals Ltd. (GNFC) which is a major fertilizer component, has installed 1,000 POS machines to facilitate the farmers and 35,000 farmers have been given 5 lakh fertilizers bags through digital means. And it is a matter of great pleasure that in the last two weeks, GNFC has registered an increase of 2 percent in fertilizer sales compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, the informal sector is very big and most of the people are paid wages, money is being paid in cash and wages are paid in cash.
They get 80 where they get 80 or 80 where they get 50 and other facilities from the point of view of health sector such as insurance.
But now cashless payments are being made.
The money is being deposited directly into the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the slaughter is shutting down and the labourers, the workers and the common man is getting the full compensation.
Besides, he is also benefitting from other benefits.
Our country is a country of youngest people.
Technology has made us easier.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made great strides with start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas, new technologies and new methods, we should not only make this sector stronger but also join the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
A large section of the people of other writers have pointed to the fact that such a good work, the work of the country's welfare, such a sacred work, however, however, the people have mentioned about the way Gorakhpur is being done, how new paths are being discovered for wrongdoings.
And in the third phase, people have given their support to what is happening. However, there are also those who are encouraging and encouraging to take even more drastic steps for this thing.
I am grateful to the countrymen for helping me in writing so many letters.
ShrimanGurumaniKell has written on MyGov: This step to curb black money is apt for praise.
We are being harassed by our citizens, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support we are supporting in this fight.
We are fighting like militias against corruption, black money etc. The same feeling is being illuminated in every corner of the country as Gurumani Kewalji has written.
We are all experiencing it.
But this thing is also true that when people suffer from pain and suffering from problems then what is the person who does not suffer from pain
The more pain you have, the more pain you have.
But for a better goal, for achieving a higher goal, when the work is done with good intention then the countrymen remain patient in the midst of difficulties, pain and pain.
In fact, these people are the focal points of change.
I also express my gratitude to the people for another reason that they have not only suffered difficulties but have also given a befitting reply to some people who are trying to mislead people.
Someone said, the price of salt has increased, some are going to spread, some are going to get 2000 notes, 500 and 1000 notes are going to be rubbed, others are going to be rubbed.
I also salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, I clearly feel that nothing is impossible when millions and millions of Indians stand with you.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country and salute them that people have participated enthusiastically in this Mahayagya against corruption and black money.
There will also be extensive discussions in the House for the political parties and for the disbursement of political parties.
Had it been Parliament, there would have been good discussions.
The people who are spreading rumours that political parties have all the concessions are wrong.
Those who cannot support open corruption and black money, they are always trying to find the government's faults.
This government is for the people.
The government is constantly striving to take recourse to the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the very first day, on the eighth day that this battle is extraordinary.
What is the strength of the malpractices that have been associated with black money and corruption for 70 years
When I have decided to compete with such people, they too adopt new innovations every day to defeat the government.
I would like to conclude by congratulating the people of Wala.
How did this become possible .
Let me tell you the secret.
The secret is that I am getting all these information from the people.
The more information available from the government machinery, the more well-known citizens, the more we succeed, the more it is due to the awareness of the common citizens.
Can an aware citizen of my country imagine how much danger he is taking to open such elements
And most of the information that is being discovered is getting success.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can send it to someone who wants to give this kind of information.
You can also send it to Maya Gov.
There is also a third group of letter writers and this too is in very large numbers.
He says: Modi ji will not be tired, he will not be able to stop and he will have to take as much difficult steps as he has taken but now he has taken the path till Manjil.
I express my gratitude to all those who write such letters because there is a kind of faith and blessing in their letters.
And there is no question of moving back in the blessings of crores of Indians.
We have brought it out and we have enacted a multi-pronged Benami Property Act.
In the coming days, those laws will also do their work.
Our priority is to do whatever is required for the welfare of the nation and for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, last month also I had said in Mann Ki Baat that in the midst of these difficulties our farmers have broken the record of last year by working hard.
This is an auspicious sign in the field of agriculture.
Be it the labourers of this country or the farmers of this country or the youth of this country, the hard work of all of them is bringing a new color today.
In the last few days, India has made its name very proud in many fields at the global economic forum.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have improved 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and improved the World Banks Logistics Efficiency Index 2016 to 17.
There are several reports that have been suggested in this direction and India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The President, the Vice President also openly expressed his disapproval.
However, sometimes something good happens in such situations and sometimes the mind gets a lot of satisfaction.
An excellent work has been done in the midst of the Hobbala of Parliament which the country has not noticed.
Brothers and sisters, Today I feel proud and happy to say that a bill related to the campaign for the Divyangjans was passed by the Parliament.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to the Divyangjans.
I have also personally tried to make a movement more effective.
I meant that the Divyangjans should get their rights and respect, which they deserve.
Our efforts and trusts were strengthened by our Divyang brothers and sisters when they won four medals in the Paralympics.
He not only enhanced the pride of the country but also surprised the people with his own capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, have a precious heritage and a precious heritage.
I am happy today that after the passage of these laws in the interest of the Divyangjans, the Divyangs will have more employment opportunities.
For them, reservation limit for government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides for special provisions for education, facilities and redressal of grievances of Divyangjans.
You can guess how sensitive the government is for the Divyangjans in the last two years that the central government has organised four thousand three hundred fifty camps for the Divyangjans and distributed resources to 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
The government has enacted new laws in accordance with the sentiments of the Nation.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have learnt from the sports fields that have made us all proud.
As an Indian, it is natural for all of us to be proud.
The Indian cricket team has won four zeroes in the anti-England category.
Some of these young sportspersons were eligible for exposure.
Virat Kohli, who had drunk exams, took a good leadership along with a good batting.
Indian cricket team's off-spinner R.
Ashwin has been declared the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016 by ICC.
My best wishes to you all. My best wishes.
In the field of Hockey after fifteen years, good news came and discovered a wonderful story.
Our Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, it has been an occasion when the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Our women sportspersons have also done wonders last month.
Indias womens hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago, Indias womens hockey team won the Asia Cup event for the adult players below 18.
I heartily congratulate all the players of cricket and hockey team.
Last month, we were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year on Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Deepawali at the height of the Himalayas with the jawans of ITBP and the soldiers of the armed forces.
He was full of emotions and not only this, the kind of good wishes sent by the people of the country, the kind of joy and happiness that included the country's security forces was a wonderful reflection.
And people did not just send the message but they were connected with their hearts.
Someone made a video that means almost every household became a soldier's post.
And whenever I saw those letters, I was also surprised to know how many imaginations and emotions were there and Mygov thought that some of these things should be stored and made a coffee book.
The work is going on.
The contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country and the feelings of the country's soldiers will be integrated into this book.
But it didn't seem true this time.
This time it did not seem that there is a festival and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are celebrating Diwali with crores of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the armed forces, the strength of the armed forces increases by 125 crores.
Just a while ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanches from the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with this kind of affection and dedication, those Sarpanches of the villages spoke to me and touched my heart.
I urged them to go and focus on the future of those children.
Today, I am glad that all the Sarpanches from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me and have made everyone aware by going to the villages.
A few days ago, when the board examined, about 95 of the girls and girls from Kashmir participated in the board exams.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children from Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
I convey my best wishes to them for their enthusiasm, but at the same time I extend my heartiest congratulations to their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village sarpanches.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that everyone's suggestions have come on one side.
Everyone used to say that we should talk about 500 rupees and one thousand rupees in an extensive manner.
However, on 8th November at 8 pm, while addressing the nation, I had discussed the launch of a massive drive to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is, the more important it is.
And I was supposed to face a lot of new challenges in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so huge that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
The drive to eradicate diseases that we have been suffering for seventy-seven years cannot be easy.
I can understand your problems and telephones with a good understanding.
However, when I see your support, when I see your cooperation and several efforts are being made to mislead you, even then sometimes even those incidents that disturb your mind are coming out, you have well understood this path of truth, you have accepted this thing of the country's right to close the notes of 500 thousand rupees.
And the world is looking at such a big country, such a huge number of notes, billions and billions of notes and these decisions. Every economist is analysing and evaluating it very closely.
The entire world is witnessing the fact that will the country's 1. 25 billion Indians be successful even by telephone calls and telephone calls
There may be questions in the minds of the world.
India has only faith in crores of Indians and it is believed that it will fulfil the resolutions of crores of Indians.
And our country will emerge as gold in every way and it is because of the people of this country.
This path of success has also become possible due to you people.
All the units of central government, state governments and local bodies, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night with dedication.
In the midst of different kinds of tensions, all these people are working with a very quiet mind to consider it a sacrifice for the service of the nation and to make a great difference.
When the morning starts, it does not even know when the night will be there, but everyone is doing it.
And that is why it is clear that India will succeed.
And I have seen that all the people of Bank and Post Office are working in the midst of these difficulties.
And if we talk about humanity then they are seen twofold ahead.
Someone told me that an old brother had died in Khandwa.
Suddenly money was needed.
And I was glad to know that he was brought to his house, to that old man so that he could help in the treatment.
Numerous such cases emerge everyday on TV, in media, in newspapers and in conversations.
I conclude by congratulating all my colleagues who have worked hard and worked hard in this great soul.
It is only when you cross the bottom of the bottom.
I clearly remember that the campaign was going on under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and the bank employees had put it on their shoulders and the work that was not done in seventeen years.
Today, once again, he has taken up this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of crores of Indians, the collective strength of all will make this nation a new strength.
They are finding illegal ways to save their money.
The sad fact is that in this also he has found a way by using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money into their accounts or doing something to them.
I would like to tell such people today - whether it is your duty to amend or not to abide by the law or not.
But please do not disturb the lives of the poor.
Don't do anything so that the name of the poor falls on the record and when it comes to checking then my dear poor get stuck because of your sin.
And the Benami property has become so stringent that it is being implemented. And the government does not want to face any problem for our countrymen.
My name is Ashish Pare.
I am the ordinary citizen of Tirali village, Tirali Taluko, Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say several examples in Mann Ki Baat that despite inconvenience, people have welcomed this tough decision for the upliftment of their nation which will enhance the enthusiasm of the people and that cashless system is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have closed the notes of thousands and five hundred rupees.
I speak Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you because you had said that good days will come (alright day in the day) but no one had thought that you would make such a big decision.
Notes of 500 thousand rupees have been given to black money and corrupt people.
There will never be a better day for every citizen of India.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you all for this.
If some things are found through the medium of media, through the medium of people, through the medium of government sources then the enthusiasm to work increases.
It gives so much joy, so much pride that what a wonderful capability of the common man in my country
If you go to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this road again then you must pay the money.
And people go there, they gather and after two-four-six days when they go back then they pay their money.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, sacrifice and honesty.
I used to discuss Chacha in the elections and this thing has reached all over the world.
People from many countries of the world have also learnt to speak the word 'Church'.
But I didn't know that there should be a marriage in Chaapar Charcha.
I came to know that on 17th November there was a marriage in Surat that took place with a discussion on Chhota.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter gave tea to the people who came to marry her and did not spend anything else.
Bharat Mar and Daksha Parmar of Surat, who have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, have inspired them.
I had come late in the night and watched TV and I saw in the news that there is a small village named Dhekiya Juli in Assam.
There are tea garden craftsmen and they get money every year.
What did they do when they got a note of two thousand rupees
Four women from the neighborhood got together and shopped around and paid a loan of Rs. 2000, they didn't need a small note because all of them bought it together and decided that whenever we meet next time, we will sit and watch the audience.
People are searching for their own ways.
And also look at changes.
A message has come to the government that the people of Assam's tea garden are asking us to put an ATM there.
See how the lives of the villages are being changed.
Some people have got immediate benefits of this campaign.
The country will get benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each metropolitan municipality gets fifty percent tax on the tax net.
However, due to this decision dated 8th, all the people ran to submit their old notes.
Last year about Rs. 3,500 crore was taxed in 47 urban units.
You will be surprised to know that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the same week.
Now four times that money has come to this metropolitan city then it is natural that sewerage system will be arranged in the poorest of the population, water will be arranged and anganwadi will be arranged.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits can be seen.
Brothers and sisters, Our village and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is streamlining himself in the midst of difficulties.
Farmers have also found ways in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which the farmers and the villages have been given priority but still there are difficulties. But I believe that if a farmer faces any difficulty or natural calamities, then this time too it will stand firm.
Small traders of our country, who provide employment, also increase economic growth.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that like the big malle, even the small shopkeepers of the villages will be able to do their business for 24 hours and no law will stop them because I believe that if a large mall gets 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers of the villages get it
A major initiative has been taken to lend them loans under the Mudra Yojana.
Lakhs of crores of rupees have been transferred to such small people under Mudra Yojana because people in large numbers do small businesses and boost the trade of billions of rupees.
But it is natural for them to have a problem with this decision.
You can also download the bank's app on mobile phones.
You can also set up a POS machine for credit cards. You can also learn how to do business without notice.
Technological roads are safe and rapid.
I would like you not only to help in making this campaign a success but also to lead the transformation. And I am confident that you can lead the transformation.
I am confident that you can work in the business of the entire village on the basis of this technology.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a wheel on the paper and when it comes in hand it is different.
Sometimes they get the full salary and sometimes they have to give some portion of it and the labour force makes it a part of their lives.
With this new system, we would like you to have a bank account with your salary deposits in your bank so that the minimum wages are complied with.
Nowadays, your mobile phones also work as e-packets. You can buy from the same mobile phones that you want to buy from the small shops in Adash-Padosh and you can also pay the money.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become partners in this scheme because in the end I have taken such a big decision for the poor, farmers, labourers, deprived sections of the country that they should get the benefits of.
Today, I particularly want to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 of the population below the age of 35 years.
Youngsters and youngsters of my country, I know that you must have liked my decision.
I am also aware that you support this decision.
I also know that you are contributing a lot to take this thing forward positively.
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can you help me with my youngsters
I will be with you and you will not stop talking like this.
The experience that you have in today's world is not that much for the older generation.
It may be that the elder brothers in your family are not aware of it and parents, Kakaka-kaki and Mama-mamama might not be aware of it.
You know what the app is, you know what is online banking, you know how to book online tickets.
All these things are very common for you and you also use them. But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of a cashless society.
A hundred percent cashless society is not possible but does India start a 'Lace Cash Society'
Once we start the 'Lace Cash Society', the aim of the Cashless Society will not be far away. And I will see your physical help in it, I will see your time and I will see your resolution.
And I believe that you will never disappoint me because we all those who want to change the lives of the poor people of India will certainly be disappointed.
You are aware that today there are many opportunities for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Each bank provides online facility.
Vollet means e-packet.
Many types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and after 8th, the RuPay cards used to be very low.
The poor started using RuPay cards and there has been an increase of about 300.
In the same way, prepaid cards are available in mobile phones as well as prepaid cards are available in banks for spending money.
There is a good platform for doing business with the help of UPI that you can buy, you can send money, you can also get money. And this is so easy that the amount you send on the WhatsApp.
How to send messages on WhatsApp today, whether it is an uneducated person.
Moreover, technology will become so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this work.
Each bank has got it and now the cost of online surcharge has also been abolished and it has also been seen that in the 2-4 days newspaper every expenditure has been abolished so that the movement of the Cashless Society gets a boost.
My young friends, despite all this, the entire generation is untouched by this.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
The way creative messages are sent on WhatsApp, slogans, poems, casualties, cartoons, new imaginations, and the way in which our younger generation is creative in the midst of a lot of difficulties, it seems that this India is the speciality of the land that the Gita was born in the battlefield at some point of time, similarly today, when we are passing through such a massive transformation, then there will be a physical creativity within you as well.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes-Yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that crores of youngsters of my country will do this thing.
Do one thing, make a solemn pledge from today that you will yourself become a part of the cashless society.
Everyone has the technology to spend online on your mobile phones.
Not only this, everyday half an hour, hours or two hours, at least 10 families have this technology, how to use technology, how to download their bank's app and how to spend the money spent in your account and how to pay the beneficiaries
Even the shopkeepers should be taught how to do business.
You voluntarily have to lead this cashless society, the great campaign of bringing the country out of the circumference of this note, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to get rid of the problem and the problem.
Once the people use RuPay cards, the poor will bless you.
If ordinary citizens are educated in this system then perhaps they will get rid of all their concerns. And if all the youngsters of India take up this task then I dont believe that it will take longer.
Within a month, we will be able to emerge as a new modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 houses everyday and connect 10 households everyday.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we will be a soldier of this transformation and we will continue to bring about change.
We will move ahead with this fight to free the country from corruption and black money. And there are wealthy countries in the world where the youth of that country has changed the lives of that country and it must be realized that the change that brings about, it brings about the revolution and it brings about the revolution of the youth.
Kenya took the lead, M-PESA used the technology of a mobile system, named M-PESA and today almost the entire trade in this region of Africa has come to Kenya.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this mission forward.
I invite you to do this work collectively and personally in every school, college, university, NCC, NSS.
We will take this thing forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the country better, which is not to be missed.
This day marks the birth anniversary of one of the greatest poets of our country, Shri Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Shriman Amitab Bachan ji has given a slogan for the cleanliness drive.
It must have been observed that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji has been taking forward the cleanliness drive very well.
It seems that the issue of cleanliness has spread to his sensitivity and at the same time he remembered the work of cleanliness on his fathers birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through it.
So his son, Shri Amitabh Ji, who is running a mission of Swachhta, has sent me through the poem of Harivansh Rai ji, Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, Mera Prakya.
I salute Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Shriman Amitabji for joining Mann Ki Baat in this manner and for taking the work of cleanliness forward.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your emotions, your letters, on MYGOV and on Narendra Modi App, will always connect me with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat is at 11 o'clock, but soon after that we will start in regional languages too.
I am grateful to Akashwani for the new initiatives taken by those people so that even where Hindi language is not popular, my countrymen must get the opportunity to connect with it.
Thank you very much for your survey.
Tourists from far flung areas feel like the second name of the Indian Mass Livelihood Festival is also a natural one.
Festivals that have been in India since time immemorial till date have been time-bound changes.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of festivals from time to time and changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the demands of the society.
And it will be done through this festival.
All these things have been inspired by our ancestors in the multi-scientific festival.
Today the entire world is talking about the environment and natural destruction has become a matter of concern.
India's festival is a tradition that strengthens nature's love and culture from child to person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, there has been a celebration of responsibility for everyone.
Nowadays we disappear on Sunday, but those older generations, those who work, those who work, the fishermen etc...
Therefore, the tradition of keeping the universe and science together had developed even when we left.
Today, as I have said, when we celebrate Diwali, every festival of ours is academic.
We are well aware of the fact that one thing is going to any corner of India, from Emir to Emir's house, from the poorest of the poor to the huts of the poor, from Diwali festivals to every family, cleanliness drive is going on.
The angle of the house is cleaned up.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean our houses but also to clean the entire campus, to clean the entire district and to clean the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Several governments, parliamentarians and rulers of the world have also started forming a part of the festival of Diwali.
Whether it is the East or the West, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the sight of Diwali is visible.
You must be aware of the fact that the US Postal Service of America has also released a postal stamp on Diwali this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his portraits on the occasion of Diwali.
On the occasion of Diwali in London, the Prime Minister of Britain organised a felicitation programme to connect all societies, took part in it and perhaps the U.
And what are the pictures
Sixteen women MPs from Singapore have come out of the Parliament wearing Indian saris and this photo has become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Today, the festival of Diwali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
Australian Prime Minister conveyed his best wishes to the Indian community and urged all communities to join the festival of Diwali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand had visited India.
He told me that I have to return so soon that I am going to attend Diwali celebrations there. I mean to say that this festival of light, this festival of light, the world community is also becoming an inspiration to take light from darkness.
On the festival of Diwali, along with good clothes, good food and drinks, there is also a lot of fun of crackers.
And the children, the youth are very happy.
Anybody ignores what is fallen in the vicinity .
On the day of Diwali, news of accidents, fire news, news of malpractices are a matter of great concern.
And it is also difficult that during Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is going on very long.
It is not just one day.
In this, Govardhan Puja, say Bhai Bij, say Beneficiary Pancham, and take Kartik Purnima to Prakash Parv, it runs for a very long time.
At the same time, we celebrate Diwali and also prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
But it is a unique feature that it gives a very deep message to the society.
But it is a matter of concern that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival where worship of the sloping sun is also held.
There is a huge social message in this festival...
I would like to talk about the festival of Diwali or Chhath Puja, this time I would like to convey my best wishes to you.
But there is also a special time for me.
I express my gratitude and gratitude especially to the countrymen.
In the past few months, the events that have been taking shape, our soldiers have been giving their best for our well-being.
In my future world, the sacrifices, perseverance and hard work of the soldiers of the armed forces continue to remain steadfast.
And one of these things was inspired to dedicate this Diwali Defence Forces.
I invited the countrymen to undertake a campaign called Message to Solzers.
But today I want to say this thing by bowing down my head that there will not be any person in India who has the unparalleled love and pride for the country's soldiers and the way it has been expressed, it will give strength to every citizen of the country.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the Security Forces as much as we cannot imagine them.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons or cinematic survivors, those who have not provided lamps for the country's jawans, those who have not given a message for the country's soldiers, those media have also converted this lamp into an opportunity to express their gratitude towards the army and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Jal Sena, ground forces or the Air Force, the Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all.
I can imagine how proud this moment is for the soldiers of my country.
So many works have been done on the message to solvers hashtag, what to do in a symbolic way
I would like to read that Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
Sister-in-law Shiva has sent me a telephone message.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I speak to Shiva.
Our army brothers are getting a lot of inspiration from the message to Solzers campaign launched by this Diwali.
I belong to an army family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and father-in-law, both have been officers of the Army.
Our entire family is full of people.
I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also sacrifice so well.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are not only at the border but also at every stage of their lives.
Whether it is natural calamity, there is a crisis in the system of law, there is a need to create a bath in front of the enemies and to show the courage to bring back the misguided youth, our youngsters keep working with the spirit of nationalism at every step in their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defecation.
Now Himachal is also formed, the first November is also going to be Kerala.
But how can this success be seen
Now our ITBP jawans went out of their duties on vacations.
So perhaps there was a need to meet the Gram Sabha in the village at that time and it was being discussed in the Gram Sabha.
It was found that some families could not build toilets due to lack of money.
And see their patriotism, it was not just the serving of pills on the enemies.
He stole away his chequebook and handed it over to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those 5 houses which did not have toilets, give one thousand rupees to every family on my behalf, construct 5 toilets and make our villages free of open defecation.
I really want to thank the youngsters.
I noticed that there is no way in the far-flung jungles of Kerala and that village can be reached with difficulty while walking on foot all day.
It was difficult to reach the tribal Panchayat of Idmalakudi, that is why the engineering students in the nearby urban areas had come to know that toilets are being constructed in this village.
The cassettes of NCC, the youth of NSS, the engineering students, all together decided that we will build toilets.
The youngsters took up the goods that were required to make toilets, bricks, cements and all the goods that were required to be transported and walked on foot all day in the forest of Pella.
He worked hard to construct toilets in that village and these youngsters made a small village in the remotest jungle open defecation free.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared more than 150 municipalities - metropolitan cities - Open Defecation Free.
10 districts have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on the first November and it has been decided that the entire state will be ODF in a few months.
He has completed seven districts till date.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
I heartily congratulate the citizens of all these states for joining this noble task and contributing to the elimination of filth from the country.
My dear countrymen, there are a lot of schemes in the government and if there is another good scheme after the first scheme then we have to start the first scheme.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
Old schemes are also going on and new schemes are going on and the waiting for the future plans are also visible.
This continues to happen.
In our country there is no need for kerosene in those households where there is affordable gas connections, which have electricity connections.
The households that have gas connections, the households that have electricity, have been supplied Aadhaar numbers and I have heard that kerosene has been released to seven or eight districts.
I am confident that the entire kingdom will soon become kerosene free.
Yes, the problem will be, the intermediaries will be, the criminals will be in trouble.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
What should the country go for, what does it determine the criteria for all this even today
Gandhiji used to say, Whenever you make a plan, first recall those poor and weak faces and then decide whether the poor will benefit from what you are going to do or not.
You decide on the basis of this criteria.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes and aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of difficulties.
Whatever may be our old thinking, society must be freed from the discrimination of daughters and daughters.
It is no longer possible that the 21st century should be dark in the village.
Therefore, a massive campaign of electrifying villages and villages is progressing successfully.
We are moving ahead in time bound manner.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the poor mothers who smoke 400 cigarettes a day by cooking cooking on wooden stoves
Five crore such families have been successfully moving forward to lead a smoke-free life.
The small traders, the small traders, the sellers of vegetables, the milk sellers, the barbers, the shopkeepers and the rulers used to be stuck in the interests of the brave-hearts.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great personalities of this country, who made India the mantra of their lives, made it the mantra of their lives.
On the one hand, 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the vibrant man of the unity of the nation.
On the other hand, there is also the death anniversary of Smt.
We should not only remember the virtue of the great men but also do it.
But I was touched by the phone and pain of a gentleman from Punjab, Prime Minister Namaskar, Sir, I am talking about Jasdeep.
From Punjab, sir, you know that 31st is the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel is such a gift that he had spent his entire life connecting the country. And in this movement, I feel that he has succeeded and brought everyone along.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a single person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, history is a testimony to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did the work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
I salute the great soul who made such a great effort to bring the freedom fighters down to a flag.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, he was blamed for unity, because of his priorities of unity, he was also a victim of several disappointments but did not leave the path of unity.
It is the birth anniversary of this great man who lived his life for unity and on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
But in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of that country.
There are several languages, different species, different dresses, different food habits, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
The motto of unity lays the foundation for a strong India.
Sardar Saheb's life journey began with a struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sometimes many of us listen to the name of Amul.
Today, people are also familiar with every product of Amul outside India and India.
But very few people would know that it was the vision of Sardar Saheb, who envisioned a cooperative milk producer association.
And he reinforced the idea of sports districts, which were then called 'Kera' districts.
This is a living example of Sardar Saheb's sand and prosperity for today's 'Amul' farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb.
And wherever we may be on this unity day on 31st October, let us remember Sardar Saheb, let us resolve to unite.
My dear countrymen, in this series of festivals of Diwali, Kartik Purnima (Deepavali) is also a celebration of the Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings are still guiding not only for the entire mankind but also for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the message of service, truth and everyone.
Peace, unity and harmony were the same mantra.
When we were at the forefront of untouchability, casteism, hierarchy and deformity there, Guru Nanak Dev ji chose brother Laloo as his colleague.
If we move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', the knowledge that Guru Nanak Dev has illuminated us, the inspiration to leave discrimination, the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then who can be our guide
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev Ji, on his birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to you all on this Diwali, the name of the country's soldiers.
Thank you so much...
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you (a few days ago), we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu Kashmir.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay my homage to them.
This cowardly was enough to stir the entire nation.
There is also grief and anger in the country. And this loss does not fall to those families who lost their sons, lost their sons, lost their husbands or lost their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our armed forces.
We are proud of our army.
We, our citizens and politicians have many opportunities to speak, we also speak.
But the army does not speak, the army shows its might.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well.
Citizens of Kashmir have started to understand anti-national maladies well.
And as Jemem began to understand the true truth, he has detached such elements from himself and has come out on the path of peace.
Every parent wants that the school-colleges are working at the earliest and the farmers are also feeling that their crops, fruits etc. are being manufactured in the markets across India.
Economic activity also goes well.
And for the past few days, businessmen have started moving well.
We all know that peace, unity and goodwill are the solutions to our problems, the path of progress and the path of our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem, find ways and at the same time pav the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that rule.
The administration has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will fully comply with it.
People who think a little over what we think sometimes also offer innovative ideas.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot about social media.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to know and understand the emotions of every kind of people and it strengthens the strength of democracy.
In the last few days, a young man named Harsh Vardhan, of the 11th standard, had a different kind of thought before me.
He writes, I was very surprised after the Uri terrorist attack.
But the way to do something is suggested and what can a small student like me do
Of these, I thought that how should I also work for the benefit of the nation.
And I took a pledge that I will do an extra study of 3 hours daily.
The country will be able to work and become a right citizen.
Brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great pleasure for me that in this environment of anger, you can think in a healthy manner at such a young age.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the anger that is in the heart of the citizens of the country is a great value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
However, you would be aware that when the 1965 war took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and this kind of spirit was there in the entire country, anger was there and patriotism was there.
Everyone wanted to do something or the other. He wanted to do something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastriji had made a great effort to touch this feeling of the country in a very good way.
And he gave the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' and inspired the individuals of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had said that there is another way to express patriotism among the voices of Bomb and guns for every citizen.
When Mahatma Gandhi was also running the freedom movement, when the movement was on its pace and a stability was needed in the movement, he used to do very successful experiments in turning that intensity of the movement towards creative work in the society.
All of us, the army, the administrators, the administrators will perform their duties and if we make a constructive contribution with the feelings of our countrymen, every citizen, this patriot, by doing something or the other, our country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the sportspersons who went to the Paralympics created history and their vision is the victory of human emotions.
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a great job and you should mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only this, every person of the country has got an emotional bond with our sportspersons of the Paralympics.
Perhaps, beyond sports, the perspective of paralysis and of our players has changed the perspective of humanity and our approach towards the Divyangs.
This is a very powerful saying.
This time, 1 players including 3 women from our country participated in the Paralympics.
When the Divyangs play in comparison to other sportspersons, physical talent, sports skills are even bigger.
He won the Golden Jubilee second time in the Golden Jubilee edition of Bhai Debendra Jhajariya Bhalphank and won it again after 12 years.
Age grows in 12 years and once a Golden monetary win, spirit slightly diminishes.
However, Devendra pointed out that the condition of the body, the aging could not weaken his resolve and that he had brought the golden chandra after 12 years.
And he was not a Divyang since his birth.
He had to lose one of his own hands due to the electrification of electricity.
Just imagine, a person who attains the first Golden Moon at the age of 23 and at the age of 35 gets the second Golden Moon.
Mariyappan Thangavela won the Golden lunar in a high jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right foot at the age of 5.
Poverty was also not the backbone of their engagement.
They are not going to live in big cities, they come from the middle class rich families.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, the country was awarded medals with determination even in the midst of physical difficulties.
In the name of Deepa Malik of a sportsperson, the pride of pouring out a variety of winners has been added.
Varun C.
The Bronze medal was bagged by Bhati.
These medals are not only a medal winner but they have done a great job in our country, in our society, in our neighborhood, in looking at our brothers and sisters of Divyang.
Our sensibilities are not only reflected but our vision of looking at these Divyangjans has also changed.
Very few people will know how these Divyangjans have achieved their might at this time's paralysis.
A few days ago, the same place was the Olympics competition.
This time it has been built.
The 1500 meter race in which the Olympics competition was won by the winners of the Golden uadrilateral, Vikram by Algeria's Abdullatif Baka, in the 1500 meter race for the Divyangs, batched a 17-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-second breakthrough in a short span of time.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that those Divyangjans who came in the fourth rank did not get any medal as a race competition but they too had run in a short span of time in the competition of ordinary race winners.
Once again I congratulate all these sportspersons. And in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a roadmap for the development of Paralympics as well.
My dear countrymen, last night I had a wonderful experience in Navsari of Gujarat.
I had a lot of emotional moments for me.
A Mega Camp of the Government of India was organised for Divyangjans and was established on the occasion.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book to the public, which has stored the successful stories of some Divyangjans.
It was a very inspiring event.
I consider it important to build a world record on the land of India and Navsari.
It was successfully used to accommodate the hearing machines to listen to the disabled persons within eight hours.
It was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all our countrymen to have a third world record by the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the second October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day I said that cleanliness should be our nature and it should be the duty of every citizen.
Now, on the second October, when we are two years old, I can assure you that there has been an increase in the awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of crores of Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we can say that everybody has tried to move forward.
That is, the country has moved hundreds of crores towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is true.
We have seen how good the results are and what is happening due to some such efforts.
Be it bus stations or railways or schools or colleges or religious places or be it hospitals or be it harakoi or be it children or be it the elderly, be it villages or the poor or farmers or women, everyone is contributing something or the other in terms of cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For the sake of health, for the dignity of the citizens, especially for the honour of mothers and sisters, there should be a banquet in the open.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in the near future in the direction of liberation from the habit of shrunken trees.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal of ODF altogether on October 2.
Especially my young friends, I would like to introduce a scheme for those who are using technology in abundance.
Everyone has the right to know the status of cleanliness drive in your city and therefore the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1866.
You will not only be able to know the status of construction of toilets in your city but you will also be able to make a request for toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has been launched to find out the status of sanitation related grievances and redressal of grievances.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
This Swachhta Abhiyan will not be a matter of constraint only to cultures.
Cleanliness is not enough.
It should be used in making waste fertilizers and for this it has also been initiated by the Government in the policy direction.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to procure the compost from the waste and the Semi Fertilizer.
And this fertilizer will reach the farmers who want to go to the livelihood.
Those who want to improve the health of their soil, they are worried about the health of the soil, they want to stop the damage caused due to chemical fertilizers.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan Ji has contributed a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite the youngsters to start ups in the waste to wealth from waste to consumption movement, develop such tools, develop such technologies, work on cheap manufacturing.
A special event Indo-Sanitary India Cleanliness Council is also being organised from 25th September to 2nd October this year.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors of metropolitan cities and Commissioners from all over the country, all these things have to be done in depth by merely contemplating cleanliness.
What can be done in technology
What can be the economic structure
How to do public participation
How to increase employment opportunities in this
All issues are to be discussed.
And I can see that there is a new information about cleanliness.
One day I had read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 10 villages and started an awareness campaign to build toilets.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly a thousand toilets.
A few days ago, you must have seen that under the leadership of Vingak Commander Param Vir Singh, a group travelled 2800 kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar and delivered the message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also created a calendar timeline for the entire year in its respective departments.
Each department will focus specifically on cleanliness for 15 days.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS), Panchayati Raj Department and Department of Rural Development (DRD) are all three to work together to promote sanitation in their respective areas from 1st to 15th October, 2019 in the coming month.
And the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Department of Consumer Affairs, among other three departments, will undertake a Swachhta Abhiyan for 15 days in the last two weeks of October 16-October 31.
It must have been seen that the survey of cleanliness is underway today.
Once a survey of 3 cities was carried out, the report of the cleanliness situation was presented to the people of the country.
Now the 500 cities of the country with more than one lakh population have their own legacy. And because of that there is a belief in every city that we have lagged behind but now we will do something good.
An atmosphere of cleanliness has been created.
I hope that how much we can contribute to this movement by all our citizens.
The next October marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastriji.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has also been going on for two years.
I have been urging you to buy something from Khadi on Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge every family to have some Khadi cheese so that the light of Diwali can be illuminated in the houses of the poor.
This is the second Sunday of October, as a citizen, can we link ourselves to cleanliness
If you have a video, send the video.
If our efforts across the country will once again give a new boost to this movement and a new momentum.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, whenever I had told you about the release of gas subsidy and the response given by the countrymen is a very inspiring event in Indias national life.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to leave in shares and the old toys they used to ask for their donations and the toys they used to pay their dues to the poorest of the poor.
Seeing the wonderful pleasure that the poor kids were enjoyed with toys
The centenary year of Pandit Deendayal ji begins today with the work of describing the political ideology of lakhs of workers working on political ideology like me, with the philosophy of India's roots politics, the vision of India's cultural heritage that has given a political philosophy, unity and human philosophy.
The principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the people of Hawada.
How does the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He gave the entire economic procedure to work for every hand, water to every field, in two words.
We can make the country free from poverty only when the country celebrates its birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, when the attention of the governments of the society and the interests of the poor get the benefits of development.
As a part of this, the path that was known as the Rescue Road of Aajsudhi British has been named as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya on the occasion of his birth centenary year.
This is a reflection of the centenary year of poor welfare.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
It has been my sincere endeavor that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to praise those government works.
How is the indifferent human of this country inspiring me
Have the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country been fulfilled
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way Mann Ki Baat has praised and improved the way he has blessed him.
I am also grateful to Akashwani for making efforts to spread these things not only to me but also to bring them to all languages.
I also express my gratitude to the countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat and wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat and put light on the errors of the government and Akashwani gave a special programme on these letters, called upon the representatives of the government and provided a platform to solve the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20 minute dialogue but a new opportunity for social change.
For any reason what could be the other reason of greater satisfaction than this
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festivals of Vijaya Dashami, the preparations for Diwali are a different kind of atmosphere throughout the country.
This is a festival of unparalleled devotion and the unity of the society is the unity of the country.
Then how should it be Navratri or the festival of worship of Durga Puja, worship of that kind and worship of the unity of society
How to make the festival connecting humans
And we can celebrate the festival of victory by uniting ourselves only when it becomes a means of true nature.
Please follow the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand ji, the architect of Hockey.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and also remind you of his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in giving India the Golden uadrilateral of Hockey at the Olympics Games in 1928, 1993 and 1993.
We all know the names of cricket lovers and bradmans.
For Dhyan Chand ji, he said that he is a living example of Scoors Goal Like Runs, Dhyan Chand ji Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once, during a match in Kolkata, an opponent team sportsperson Hockey on Dhyan Chand ji's head.
At that time, only 10 minutes were left to complete the match.
And Dhyan Chand Ji had made three goals in 10 minutes and said, I have revenge for the injury.
However, I have seen that this time everyone has requested me to do something about Rio Olympics.
I see it positive that the common man has so much attachment to the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and putting pressure on the Prime Minister of the country.
Besides cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports that there is so much awareness and so much knowledge.
For me, reading this message became a source of great inspiration in itself.
One Shriman Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App: Please call upon the daughters in Mann Ki Baat this time on their participation in education and sports because they have made the nation proud by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
A Mr. Sachin writes, You must mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
The medals we received were awarded by these daughters.
Our daughters once again proved that they don't fall from anyone.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India and one from Eastern India.
Someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if daughters from all over India have taken the initiative to make the country proud.
On May Gov, Peak Thakur writes that we could perform better in the Olympics.
He writes, Excellency Modi sir, first of all, I congratulate you for winning the two medals in Rio. But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is no.
We need to cut a lot of distance in sports.
Our parents ask us to pay attention to education even today.
Even today, sports is considered to be a waste of time in the society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs inspiration.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny the fact that we could not showcase our hopes.
It also happened that the exhibition that our sportspersons were performing in India, the sportspersons of this place could not even reach there.
And only two medals can be awarded in the medal bag.
But it is also true that if we look at it carefully despite not getting a medal then for the first time in many games Indian sportspersons have shown great skills.
But why can we forget that she is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympics Final
This is what happened in some tennis with the combination of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bhopna.
For the first time in thirty-two years after Usha, Lalita Babar made a quote for the Trek Field Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, women hockey teams have reached the Olympics.
Indias sportspersons will definitely be good for us.
Several sportspersons like Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Athu Das are many names.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do what we have done then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
A map of how we can do better.
Just imagine, the state chooses one or two sports and plans to showcase its excellent performance.
I also urge the associations associated with sports to entertain them in an unbiased manner.
And I urge every citizen of India to send a message on the Narendra Modi App, whichever is interested in it.
Write to the government.
The Association will discuss and submit its applications to the Government.
Sending their suggestions in consultation with the State Governments.
However, let us prepare ourselves fully. And I believe that 65 of our countrymen, 65 of whom are young, have to move ahead with a resolve to achieve a better position in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September is Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for many years.
But this time when I want to go for the G-20 Summit then I got the opportunity to express my feelings in the matter of mind.
As much as the mother has a place in her life, we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life to his students, to his students.
Nowadays Pullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed after Rio Olympics.
He is a sportsperson but he has given a shining example of what is a good teacher.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an outstanding teacher besides a sportsperson.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of our fellow citizens is always reflected.
The former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan Ji and the country considers it as Teachers Day.
He might have reached that place in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
He always used to say - Good teachers are those in whose students do not die.
Live as a teacher and keep the inner student alive despite being the President's post. Such a wonderful life was reflected by Dr. Radhakrishna Ji.
I think I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
However, today I can say with joy that even though one of my teachers is now 70 years old, even today his letter comes to me every month.
And that is why if I look at any good letter then I feel very respected.
It is our collective responsibility to make our teachers proud in our society.
You must present your photographs with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if there is any inspiration to your teachers.
Look, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of students.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival will be held in a few days.
And we all want that the life of our country, of our society, of our family and of every individual remains uninterrupted.
But when we talk about the Ganesh festival then it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of Ganesh Utsav is a tribute to Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now the festival of Ganesh is being celebrated not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
Essay competitions are held and Rangoli competitions are held.
Their exhibition also highlights the artistic dimensions of the society.
This massive campaign of public education runs through the Ganesh Utsav.
We cannot convey this mantra of 'Surajya' to the people of our country through 'Ganesh Utsav'
Come, let me invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are imbibed in the society.
This time many people have also written a lot to me about Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Why should not we use the idol of Ganesha built of mud of village lakes
The idols made of POP are not suitable for the environment.
Conserving the environment, protecting our rivers and drains, protecting these small creatures from the pollution caused by them is also a service to God.
Ganesh ji is a wise man.
We should not create such a Ganesh ji that creates a law.
I don't know what form you will take these things, but I don't just say this thing, many people say it. And I have heard about many things - one sculptor is Shriman Abhijit Ghondfel.
Annual Ganeshotsav to the environment is also an act of social service.
It is still time for Durga Puja.
This is the day we decide that the statues of that old family are made by us.
If we buy idols from them, they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the soil of ponds or rivers then it will be found again.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the Ganesh festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred with Sant Uday on 4th September.
Mother Teresa dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who has served the poor of India for the rest of their lives, receives the title of Saints.
On 4th September, an official delegation will be led by the Government of India on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Every moment we learn something from saints, sages and great men.
Let us keep getting something, keep learning and keep doing something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then what a big change comes.
Janash Kait is considered to be the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with five state governments, has made a successful effort to connect people with clean Ganga and Ganga.
On 20th of this month, Sarpanches of villages along the banks of Ganga were invited to Allahabad.
Someone came from Uttarakhand for this solemn pledge that the village will not let the River Ganga get dirty.
Somebody came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar, somebody came from Jharkhand and somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India for fulfilling this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in the cleaning of the Ganga by connecting the people with Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me very much and I have a special respect for those people who are imagining them.
On July 15, more than half a dozen school students collectively wrote to their parents in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh.
This work was done by children between the ages of seven to seventy years.
Congratulations to the students who made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who decided to take their children's letters seriously and make toilets.
These are the things that inspire us.
Mallamma, a sixteen year old girl from Kopal district of Karnataka, paid satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
It has become the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
However, everybody is associated with it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about what new efforts are being made.
An idea has come up in the Government of India and has urged people to make a film of two minutes or three minutes on cleanliness which should be sent to the Government of India.
You will find details on the website.
The contest will take place and the winners will be awarded on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
I also tell the Channel winners that you should also compete by calling for such films.
Creativeness creativity can also give strength to the cleanliness drive.
New methods will be discovered, new inspirations will be given and all this will be done by ordinary artists through public participation.
It is not necessary that there should be a big studio and a good camera for making films.
A very important thing has happened in the last few days.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - now some people will know whether the President should inaugurate a radio channel
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
Akashwani Friendship on this side and Bangladesh Sheetar on the other side will share mutually beneficial content and the Bangladeshi speaking people on both sides will enjoy the akashwani.
I also thank the Bangladeshis for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate Akashwani's friends that they are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you might have given me the job of a great Prime Minister, but at the same time I feel like you.
And sometimes things touch me a little more than emotional.
Such emotional events also inspire new energy and this is what inspires people of the twelfth to do something or the other.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my heart.
A retired teacher who is about 84 years old has written this letter to me.
Had he never refused to disclose his name in this letter, I would have spoken to him today.
In his letter he wrote that when you had appealed to give up the gas subsidy, I had abandoned the subsidy and then I had forgotten it.
Brothers and sisters, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those people who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should send it to Rabru.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job and the campaign to free the poor mothers from the stove is good and I am a retired teacher.
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but of the mother's emotions. And it is the blessings of Kotikoti mothers and sisters that give strength and confidence to the future of my country.
I salute that mother and also salute the mothers of Kotikoti of India who have always been reluctant to suffer.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought but this month of August has been continuously filled with flood problems.
Some parts of the country were flooded.
The state governments, local bodies, social institutions and citizens could do as much as they could.
However, there were some news that needed to be remembered among the flood reports too.
What is the strength of unity and what a big outcome can be achieved if we walk together, that is why the August of this year will be remembered.
In August 2016, a number of parties including political parties, non-opposition parties and 70 parties from all over the country and several other parties in the Parliament passed the GST Bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties in the country talked about Kashmir in a single voice in terms of Kashmir situation.
If he has to put it in minimum words then I would say that unity and faith - these two things remain in the original mantra. And all of us believe that there is a belief of 1. 25 billion Indians, from the Sarpanch of the village to the elder Prime Minister that if anyone dies in Kashmir or if someone is a young man or a security worker, this loss belongs to our people, it belongs to our country, it is our country, it is those people who have been trying to create unrest in Kashmir and sometimes they will have to answer the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is full of diversity and diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to keep a nation full of diversity within the boundaries of unity, as a citizen, as a society, as a government, to emphasize the importance of unity and to bring it out, only then will the country be able to make a bright future.
My house believes in the familiarity of crores of Indians.
English rendering of PMs Mann ki Baat programme on Akashvani
My dear countrymen, greetings.
Today morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi. And I believe that in the days to come, the color of sports will be enriching to every youngster across the country.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest sports event is going to be held.
The word Rio will echo again and again in our ears.
The entire world will be a sports person.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the exhibition of its sportspersons.
Our hopes and aspirations are immense but those who have gone to play in Riyo, the work of enhancing the enthusiasm of the sportspersons is for the 125 crore Indians.
The Government of India organised a well organized Run for Rio, Khelo Our Geo, Khelo Our Khilo in Delhi today.
In the coming days, wherever we may be, let us motivate some of our athletes.
Whatever be the hobby of food, we have to leave everything.
Even if there is sweet sleep in the winter, one has to leave the bed and run to the field. And not only the player but his parents too.
The sportspersons did not become overnight.
I am also ready to do this thing on behalf of you.
He is ready to be the Chief Postman of the country to deliver your message to these players.
Come, let us make every sportsperson proud in the coming days.
And today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poet-loving Central University student Suraj Prakash Upadhyay has sent a poem.
Maybe there will be many other poets who would have sent poetry, maybe they would have written poetry but some would also make them sound.
Everyday technology keeps changing, everyday it takes a new look, everyday it creates a new impact, it keeps changing.
You cannot capture technology.
If research and innovation are not done then technology becomes a burden in the way the barren water spreads dirt.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation with the trust of old technologies then we will come out of the changing era of the world. And that is why the new generation will have to inculcate the spirit of science, research on technology and innovation.
Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
It is aimed at creating an ecosystem across the country through Atal Innovation Mission, innovation, experimentation, enterprise, this trend and thereby enhancing employment opportunities.
Similarly, there is a direct link between the Incubation Centre with Innovation.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government is thinking of providing a huge amount of Rs. 10 crores.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We face problems in our daily lives.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And the Atal Grand Challenge has called upon the young generation of the country to find, research, innovate and solve the problems faced by you through technology.
Government of India seeks to give a special prize to the technology discovered for solving our problems.
And I am glad that when we talk about tinkering labs, about 13,000 schools applied and when we talked about incubation centres, more than four thousand institutes came forward for educational and non-educational incubation centres.
I believe that the way our new generation will work on technology to solve the problems of our daily life, simplification to get rid of our difficulties.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about the drought and now the joy of rain is also coming and the news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are making every effort to help the flood victims collectively.
Even if there are some complications due to rain, everyone's mind, every human mind gets thrilled because the centre of our entire economic activity is rain- it is agriculture.
Sometimes such a disease also occurs that we lose our lives.
However, if we remain aware, if we remain alert, if we try to avoid it then it is very easy.
Dengue and Leo.
Dengue can be avoided.
Focus on hygiene, be a little cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to children, and this disease comes only in the poorest of the population.
Dengue is at the forefront of prosperous regions and hence we understand that.
You must be watching the advertisements on TV but sometimes we are very conscious of it and take some precautionary measures.
The government, the hospital and the doctor will not only do their work but we will also be cautious about not entering dengue in our homes, in our area and in our family.
I would like to draw your attention to another difficulty, my dear countrymen.
Life has become so racing, it has become so busy that there is no time for us to think about it.
If you have become ill then you feel that you get alright quickly and for this you start falling sick by taking antibiotics .
But the bacteria that are used by these medicines, and then these medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria, and then it goes on for years in fighting, making new medicines, doing scientific research, etc. and these diseases continue to create new problems.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing about such a change in themselves that medicines do not have any effect on them.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic recognition and hence compliance with the rules of use of antibiotics is essential .
When it comes to health, I would like to add one more thing.
Although the maternal mortality rate has decreased in the last one decade, yet the lives of a very large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy, anemia, infection related to pregnancy, high BP, no problem knowingly can ruin its life.
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, on the ninth of every month, free check-ups will be conducted at all Pregnant Women Health Centres.
Cannot my doctor brothers and sisters give 12 days in a year to the poor for this work
Many letters have been written to me in the past.
Thousands of doctors have followed my words.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I am sure you will join me.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern about it in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
During the battle of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also mentions the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says, 'Swasthathah Sarva Vrikshana' means I am drunk in all the trees.
It is said in the Shramacharya policy that there is no such vanaspati root unaushadhan which has no medicinal properties.
The festival of Mahabharata - has been discussed in detail in this and it is said that for the trees that grow, they are offspring.
There is no doubt about it.
The trees that donate, they leave them like a tree in heaven.
A few days ago, I got to know an example of Sonal, a daughter from Pune.
In the festival of Mahabharata, it is said that the tree also fulfils the responsibility of the child in the world and Sonale has taken the responsibility of fulfilling the wishes of the society and not only his parents.
The farmer Khandu Maruti Mahatra of Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, inspired the marriage of his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring way.
And when I saw his picture in social media, I was surprised to know that even though there were no signs of marriage, plants were visible all around.
The sight of the picture was heart touching.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of love for nature and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatra ji for this new endeavour.
And many people do this kind of experiment.
I remember when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
And I will say to them, See, this is the prasad of Mother-in-law and if you go to your village and worry about making it big then mother-in-law will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pilgrims used to visit and lakhs of plants were distributed this year.
Temples can also start the tradition of planting plants instead of prasad in this season.
It can become a mass movement - tree plantation.
I have repeatedly told the farmer brothers that if we ruin our land on the banks of our fields then why should not we cultivate timber instead of wax
If we plant trees along the banks of our farms that are fertile and homeless then it can be cut and sold after fifteen-twenty years as per the government's permission.
And it can become a new source of income for you and India can also save yourself from importing timber.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan- Desert - has celebrated such a huge forest and has resolved to plant 25 lakh saplings.
25 lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the soil of Rajasthan, they know how big they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also resolved to increase its green cover by fifty percent.
The Union Government has run the Green India Mission under which the Railways has taken up this task.
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav.
This year, in Gujarat, many projects like Amravan, Ekta Van, Martyr Forest have been taken up as forest festivals and have been running a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they too deserve to be congratulated.
But for me the journey to South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness come to light in the world, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela flourish.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoenix Settlement, known as Mahatma Gandhis residence, Sarvodaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity of travelling by the train which Mahatma Gandhi had visited and the train which had laid the foundation stone of becoming Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to say is that I got the opportunity to meet those dignitaries who had sacrificed their lives for equality and equality and had fought with Nelson Mandela.
He spent twenty-twenty-two years in jail with Nelson Mandela.
In a way, the entire youth was inspired by him and I was fortunate to have a darshan of these dignitaries - Shri Ahmad Katha, Shriman Laloo Cheeba, Shriman George Bezori, Ronnie Kasarils, close associates of Nation Mandela.
The duties described in the Gita were clearly reflected in the duties.
My heart will be remembered for that visit.
There cannot be a greater mantra for any society and government than that.
The priority will be different but the path is the same and that path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and compassion.
Let us take pride in our Indians, who have also shown the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who have conveyed to me their concerns are very natural.
I am saddened by being a woman.
And some people get confused and get entangled in money.
A new method of robbery through this technology is spreading all over the world.
And that too on an SMS.
And in a few moments they came to know that everything has been robbed.
But recently I had a pleasant feeling.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Artistic paintings are on the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then definitely go to the station.
Today, I get such news from many railway stations of India that the local people are presenting their identities on the walls of railway stations through their art.
An innovation is happening.
This is an example of how peoples participation can be transformed.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country and special greetings to my colleagues of Aligarh.
And you will also be joining the festival outside and at home.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is of special significance to us.
Like last year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, cant you give the mothers and sisters of your country a big security insurance scheme or a life insurance scheme
Think, give the sister a gift that will protect her in life.
And today it is social security.
Today Raksha Bandhan is the true meaning.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born after Independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in independent India.
May the entire country be colored in the colour of freedom fighters, let us once again feel the smell of freedom all around and let us make this atmosphere.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will do something or the other associated with the inspiration of patriotism.
You would like to keep your words from the ramparts of the Red Fort so intensely.
And nowadays, the technology platform is so easy that you can send things to me easily.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat speech on All India Radio
Everyone makes several programmes during the holidays.
And because there is a season of mangoes during the holidays, it also feels like enjoying mangoes.
And sometimes there is a feeling that if you get an opportunity to sleep for some time in the afternoon then it is good.
But the horrible heat of this time has made all the fun of it.
But I have seen that even the citizens make very good efforts.
In many villages, awareness is being observed and the value of water is known to those who are involved in the problem of water.
And that is why there is a sensitivity about water and there is also an activity to do something.
A few days ago, someone told me that Havere Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers there have solved the water as a very sensitive question in the village.
It has decided to release the crops that used to be the maximum use of water, be it sharks or bananas.
It sounds very easy to hear, but it's not that easy.
And all of them went to the fields of horticulture and vegetables where there is minimum water requirement.
He has taken all the initiatives like fountains, drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, water conservation etc.
Okay, I may be talking about a small Havre Bazar village but there will be several such villages.
I also express my gratitude to all such villagers for their excellent work.
Somebody told me that there is a Gorwa Gram Panchayat in the district of Badas in Madhya Pradesh.
The Panchayat has tried to create sesame seeds.
Although water is saved, but when the water comes to the surface then the quality of water also improves significantly.
Sometimes it seems that when the Government of India provided water to Latur by train, it became a news for the world.
It is a matter of fact that the speed at which this work has been done by the Railways deserves to be congratulated but the people of Pela village deserve the same congratulations.
I would say, I deserve more congratulations than railways.
But there are several schemes that run by the citizens that do not come to an end.
It is the nature of a person, although sometimes sometimes sometimes some good news comes and sometimes it feels that the entire crisis has gone away.
The possibility of rainfall from 106 to 110 this year has come to an end as if a message of great peace has come to an end.
Now it is time for rains to come but the news of good rainfall has also brought a new consciousness.
It gives us as much opportunity as news provides us with good rainfall and also throws a challenge.
Can we run a campaign to save the water in the villages from now on
Farmers need soil and they are used to grow crops in the fields.
This time why should we not take soil from the ponds of the village and take it to the fields
It will also improve farm land and enhance water conservation capacity of ponds.
Whether water can be stopped in some cement bags, empty bags of any fertilizer, soil filled with soil
If the water stops for five days, if the water stops for seven days then the water will fall into the ground and the ground will be filled with water.
Our wells will get water.
We should stop as much water as we can.
So whether it is water crisis or drought, we have time for the next one and a half months.
And I have always said that when we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, one of the different places we want to see is that in order to save the rain water, two hundred years old potholes have been constructed under the house and the water remains so clean.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come up, several schemes have been formulated and cost-effective. That is why it is very natural for crores of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to raise this question in their minds.
Ganga Mokshadayini is for those who have religious beliefs.
I will not accept this glory but I feel that the Ganga is a life-saving lifeline.
Ganga gives us a new energy to live and we are blessed with a new energy.
Just as Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
One Bhagirath was brought by us but crores of crores of rupees were needed to save them.
This cannot be successful without a peoples participation.
And that is why we all have to become a representative of sanitation, sanitation and transformation.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to collaborate with the states that are located on the banks of river Ganga.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent hypothesis and industrial pollution.
Everyday large quantities of solid waste are discharged into the Ganges.
In order to clean such waste, the trash skimmers at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. are working to clean the waste water immediately.
These machines have been provided to all the local bodies of Swaraj and it has been requested to continuously run them and clean the garbage from there.
And in the last few days, I have been told that a lot of effort is being made there and everyday 3-11 tons of waste is being removed.
Out of the pulp and paper industry, the emission of waste or black linker has almost completely stopped.
All this indicates that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person meets not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he definitely says - Saheb, will Ganga be cleaned
Therefore, the people who believe in it will definitely succeed in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This system is running in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system is gradually working as an important unit of our democratic system throughout the country.
Therefore, in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India has undertaken Gramodaya Bharat Abhiyan for 10 days from 14th April to 24th April.
And today on 24th, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our tribal brothers and sisters live in the state.
And at 3 pm, once again on Panchayati Raj Day, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at the village level in every corner of India
How to make the village self-reliant
How do the villages make their own development plans
The birth anniversary of a daughter should be a celebration of a village.
There are several such schemes.
Food donation programmes were organised in some villages.
Perhaps it is very rare that such programmes have lasted for 10 days in all these villages of India.
I congratulate all the state governments and the Sarpanches of the villages for this thing.
In a very fundamental manner, with innovation, this entire opportunity has been transformed into an opportunity for the welfare of the village, for the development of the village and for the strengthening of the democracy.
The awareness that has come in villages is the guarantee of India Uday.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector over the years.
Like lack of adequate schools or colleges or lack of quality in education.
Today, if every family has any first dream then it is for the good education of the children.
After all, the ideas come to an end.
And for a country like India, this feeling of public mind is a great strength.
There should be greater awareness and anxiety about educating and educating children.
And the child also becomes aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would urge all the daughters and the parents to talk in detail about the activities being done in the school.
And if something is noticed then go to school and talk to the teachers themselves.
This opportunity can also reduce many evils from our education system.
So, in a way, efforts to spread education were a priority.
And that was also necessary.
But the more important it is to spread, the more important it is to improve our education.
We have done a massive work of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education has to become our priority with the literacy drive.
The mantra of Entry, Entry, Entrance has been resonating continuously, but now the children who have gone to school will have to focus on good education and right education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
However, it is true that there is a need to bring about radical reforms in our country.
You must have seen that the work has been done in the budget this time.
In the Budget, he has asked ten public universities and ten private universities to come out of government dams and come out on the path of challenges. Come, tell me what you want to do to become the top university.
The scheme has been formulated with the objective of providing them complete freedom.
Indian universities can also become globally competitive universities.
At the same time, the more important is education, the more important it is of skill.
Similarly, technology will also play an important role in education.
Distance education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I am confident that the results will be visible in a very near future.
People have been asking me about one subject for a long time.
Some people write on the web portal MyGov.
Some people write to me on the Narendra Modi App and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, sports is very important for youngsters along with studies.
So one day I also got the opportunity to interact with all of you before that.
As a result, I had just called a meeting where NCC was headed by NSS, head of Scouts Guides, head of Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra.
And when I asked him what he had met earlier, he said, "No brother, this is the first such meeting after the independence of our country.
I have benefitted from it in childhood. And I also believe that we should fulfil a new life of these organizations, we should irrigate a new strength.
This time I have placed a few topics before him.
Brothers and sisters, Why shouldn't our youth, all the organisations do a great job of water conservation in this season
Can we create such programmes for connecting the country
What can be the common youth songs of all our organizations
Can they add new things to their work culture and programmes
If you write on my Narendra Modi App, I will take it to the right place.
Such a situation will certainly happen.
My dear countrymen, I have conveyed to you that today we are compelled to think.
I also see it as a matter of shocking people.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country was such that in the last several elections, there was talk of how many cylinders would be given by the party
And every political party felt that if the middle class had access to the society from the point of view of elections then the issue of gas battalion was a big issue.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize them to reduce subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were set up, including a huge proposal to reduce the gas subsidy.
Crores of rupees were spent on these committees.
However, it used to be there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But there was no thought outside it.
My countrymen, I am glad to share with you all today that I have followed the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy.
But after calculating, it was discovered that more than 80 per cent of these one crore families had their own distributors, who were standing in queues and won their subsidy by writing.
This incident has compelled the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if it happens to the economists of the world then it will be the same and if we do the same results will be the same.
For them too, there is an external incident of their ideas and somehow we have to think about it.
I would particularly like to urge the entire political fraternity today to make one thing that depends on the people everywhere.
Whether you have never thought about it or not, we will get such results.
And we should go in this direction.
Please rely on those who have been sending their exams and exams.
Sometimes I also feel that we should declare that there will not be any ticket check for the railways payload today.
Every newspaper and news channel contains bad news for every breaking news.
Is it not right in the country of hundreds of crores of people around us
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive news was published on the front page of the newspaper.
He always used to say this thing.
A few days ago, a newspaper had also written to me saying, We have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news.
Good news becomes the biggest source of inspiration for good news.
However, it is true that the more we strengthen goodness, the lesser the place for your evils.
If we light the lamp then darkness will go away and it will happen.
You can also contribute in this thing.
Raviji has given a good suggestion but please don't be angry with me.
Let us all strive together to make a positive effort and make a positive effort.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can also be a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people in the world would be aware that crores of people would come to the bank of the river for such a long time.
For the last two days, I have been seeing that many people have been uploading the photographs of the Singhth Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the State Governments to compete with it.
Photo contest and ask people to upload yourself with beautiful photographs.
How the atmosphere will be created and people will also be aware of the diversity that is taking place at the edge of Kumbh.
This can be done.
This thing is true, I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and he used to say that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that cleanliness is there.
People should also take the message of cleanliness from there.
I believe that this Kumbh Congregation may be a religious and spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
How this Kumbh Mela can be used to spread the message of water conservation, how to increase the love for water, how to increase the faith in water.
My dear countrymen, I would like to meet you once again on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
You might remember that last time I had discussed a book about Premchand ji's narratives and we had decided that we will share some of the books with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information about books.
I am glad that people are discussing and writing books on subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
Okay, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But one thing I have to acknowledge is that now I cannot spend too much time reading books.
However, one advantage has been realized that when you people have written to me, I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But from the experience of the past month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
And whenever we read new books, write about them and discuss about them.
And you can also give us a good name for this book's counter.
I want this book to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Keep reading, writing and sharing it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made for water conservation throughout the country.
People must be told about traditional methods and methods.
The media too has a lot of innovative ideas on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, they are doing something or the other at the level of the war.
It is heartening and satisfying to see the strength of collectivity.
For example, the kind of enthusiasm that the villagers of Jharkhand have shown about water management in the Ara Keram village of Orwegi block, just a short distance from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
You will be happy to know that Meghalaya, the beautiful state of Ishaan India, has become the first state in the country to formulate its water policy-water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, crop farming is being encouraged which requires less water and farmers are not harmed.
I would like to especially congratulate the Haryana Government for interacting with the farmers and motivating them from traditional farming to under-water crops.
Now the time has come for the festivals.
Several fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals.
Why shouldn't we use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in our lives enthusiastically inspire us and especially the accomplishments of children, their virtues, give us a new energy. And that is why today I feel like talking about some children - Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Banshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranesh Ganguly and Harit Ala-Manda.
Whatever I say about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that threatens the entire world.
It seems that death is at the threshold but all these ten children have defeated not only the dangerous diseases like cancer in their lives but have also illuminated Indias name all over the world due to their might.
In fact, the World Childrens Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
It is a unique sporting event where young cancer cervix is the life of people who have come out of the fight against cancer.
Competitions such as shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organised in the competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I sincerely believe that you must have been proud of Indias success in space and space - I speak of Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Aurobindorao, from many such parts of the country, many people have written to me on the NarendraModi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, from the point of view of space, 2019 has been very good for India.
Our scientists left A-SAT in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
There was not much talk of big and important news such as A-SAT during the election race.
We have achieved the capability of breaking the satellite, 300 kilometers away, in just three minutes from the A-SAT missile.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement and now on 22nd July, the entire country proudly witnessed that Chandrayaan-2 had stepped from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me what two great teachings I received from Chandrayaan 2 then I will say that these are two lessons - Faith and Firelessness, that is, devotion and fearlessness.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, we must rely on our talent and capabilities.
You will be pleased to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
It is an Indian in terms of purpose and emotion.
It is a fully indigenous mission.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-Ben by resolving all the technical problems in a record time, day and night.
The entire world has seen this great penance of scientists.
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives but always remember that we have the ability to accommodate them.
I sincerely hope that Chandrayaan-2 will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
At the same time, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly waiting for the month of September when the lander Vikram and the raw wisdom will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country. And I invite the youngsters of the country for a quiz competition.
Space-related curiosity, India's Space Mission, Science and Technology- these quiz competitions will be the main themes of competitiveness such as what one has to do to release rockets.
How the satellite is installed in the orbit and what information we get from the satellite, what is A-SAT, there are a lot of things.
I urge the young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it comfortable, pleasant and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge schools, wives, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
And the most thrilling thing is that the students receiving the highest quality from each state will be taken to Sriharikota by the Government of India at their own expense and in September they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan is landing on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historical event of their lives for these victorious students.
But for that you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to score the highest score and you will have to win.
Friends, You must have enjoyed my suggestion.
My dear countrymen, you would have noticed one thing.
Our thoughts have given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time, and similar efforts towards cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
Starting five years ago, this journey is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
Its not like that we have achieved an ideal position in sanitation, but the way the cleanliness drive has been successful from ODF to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 125 crore Indians, but we dont have to stop it.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is an engineer of the Army and has left his job in America and has returned to serve Mother India.
He had taken up the task of not only cleaning Delhi but also making it beautiful sometime back.
He started with his team the dustbins of Lodhi Garden.
Through street arts, we have decorated and decorated several areas of Delhi with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of over bridges and schools to the slums, when they began to shrink their towns, the people's support got accumulated and this order started.
You might remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street painting during Kumbh.
I came to know that Yogesh Sena and his team played a very big role in it.
Whether there is any sound in the colours or lines, the sounds produced from the pictures made from them prove to be more effective than thousands of words and we also feel the same in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us that the culture of making waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward towards making waste consumption.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, I have read a very interesting note on MyGov.
This comment was from Bhai Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote - Mann Ki Baat is keen to hear.
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June.
I feel that such programmes should be organized every three months.
There should also be an online monitoring arrangement for the programme.
In my view, this was the first such programme in which people directly interacted with the government.
After reading the message sent by Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji, my curiosity to know about the Back to Village programme increased. And when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
The people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development.
The programme lasted for a week and in all about 4,500 Panchayats in the state, government officials briefed the people about the schemes and programmes of the villages.
How to strengthen Panchayats
How to increase their income
What impact can their services have in the lives of the common man, the people of the village also showed their problems without any hesitation.
Friends, It was not merely mentioned in this programme that the officers would return to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend their time in the village.
Several other things have also been included to make the programme interesting.
Under Khelo India, sports competitions for children were organized.
Sports Kit, MGNREGA Job Card and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
People of Kashmir became participants in this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to undertake a one-and-a-half-day walk through difficult roads to reach the mountains.
These officers also reached the surrounding Panchayats, which are always at the cross-border tableau, not only this, the officers also reached the highly sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts without any fear.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in villages for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it shows that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir love good governance and this also proves that the power of development always remains a burden on the power of the bombs.
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred and hurdles in the path of development will never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, honoured with the Gyanpeeth Award, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems in this manner.
In this poem, he has said: i.e. the bond of rain and water streams is unique and the earth is obsessed with its beauty.
Throughout India, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the Shravan month in their own way.
In this season, whenever we look around us, it feels as if the earth has covered greenery.
During this period a festival of Raksha Bandhan is also celebrated to symbolize the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be delighted to know that during the last four years, most of the devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since July 1, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
This year, more than 28 days have been added to the pilgrimage that lasted for 60 days in 2015.
For the success of the Amarnath Yatra, I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who return from their journey become admirers of the feelings of warmth and intimacy of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that in Uttarakhand too, this year's Chardham Yatra has started and within one and a half months more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham.
For the first time since the severe disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have arrived there.
I appeal to you people that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty blossoms immensely during the monsoon season.
There can be no better teacher than tourism and travel to see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country.
My best wishes to you all for this beautiful and lively month of Shravan to communicate new energy, new hopes and new aspirations in all of you.
Similarly, the month of August is remembered for the uit India Month.
And when we want to watch TV then we can see only one aspect of the rains - floods, frozen water, traffic jams all around.
Thank you very much to everyone.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am concerned as much as you are concerned about the examinations of your children.
But if we change our way of looking at exams then perhaps we can get rid of anxiety.
In my last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I was happy to note that you must send me your suggestions, your experience on the Narendra Modi App.
Teachers, whose career has been very successful, have been sent to me by parents and some thinkers of the society.
I will also talk about what I have heard and what I have read.
I would also like to see a lot of fervor.
I would like to share with you the messages that Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India.
You must work hard but decide for yourself a real mixed goal and try to achieve that goal.
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations from me.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought that I would hope and fulfil my goals.
However, I am fulfilling my vision and fulfilling it. I am doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speaking and the goals were gradually achieved.
I will tell you that it is very important for you to have positive thoughts.
Why the competition
Why not competition
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why should we not compete with ourselves
Why shouldn't we decide to break all our old records
You people, no one can stop you moving ahead.
And when you break your old records then you will find a sense of satisfaction and satisfaction.
Do not consider the Friends Examination as a game of statistics.
Don't be stuck in the minds of someone who has reached Kate.
Life must be linked to some great objective.
We should move ahead with our dreams, we should move ahead with our resolve.
Whether these exams are going to be true or not, our speed is correct or not.
And that is why if the dreams are huge and huge then the exam will become a joy only after that.
Each exam will be a step towards fulfilling this great objective.
Every success will become the key to that great objective.
And for this, do not be confined to what will happen this year.
Walk with a very big goal and if anything remains less than that then there will be no depression.
And it will be courageous to make efforts with greater strength.
Thousands of people have written small things to me on my app through mobile phones.
Sage Gupta stressed that there is a healthy mind in a healthy body.
Students, along with your studies, also keep in mind your health so that you can write properly in the examination.
Now I am not saying this thing last day that you start punishing yourself and go for three kilometres and five kilometres to run.
But one thing is true that how is your daily routine especially during the days of examination
Our daily routine should be in tune with our dreams and resolves for 365 days.
I agree with one thing of Shriman Prabhakar Reddy Ji, he has specifically requested that you sleep on time and you should wake up early in the morning and review it.
Admission letters and other items should be made at the examination centre before scheduled time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said this thing: I may not have the courage to say this because I am a little distressed about sleeping.
And many of my friends also complain to me that you are sleeping very less.
And this is possible.
I'm not talking about staying asleep.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if there is some problem in one or one or two parts of our body.
Not only this, our daily routine also gets disturbed.
And that is why we should not consider any thing as a small one.
You guys, you don't have a habit of compromising with what is certain.
Fix, check.
Friends, sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examination have two types of students.
You must have seen these two types of students.
If anyone can do this thing better than me, if it is a check-master and the big sportspersons of the world who have checked out.
Champion Vishwanathan Anand will share his experiences.
Come, let us learn from them the way you check in this exam.
Hello, I convey my best wishes to Vishwanathan for the first time.
I will talk a little bit about the examinations and experiences that I have given.
Exams seem to be like the problems faced in life later on.
When you play, you dont know what kind of wages will be there, just as you dont know in class what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have sufficient smoke then you will be given the right answer which will give you the mind at the moment.
So be calm.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself and don't keep too much expectations.
See this as a challenge. I remember the experiences that I have experienced during the year, I can solve the problems.
In the last few minutes you may not be able to remember, you must pass through important issues.
You can recall some of the details of teachers or students who will help you in writing the exams.
If you repeat the difficult questions then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write it very well in the examination.
Therefore, stay calm, take sufficient smoke, do not be very confident, and do not throw away slightly, initially there is danger but I have successfully passed these examinations.
Therefore, believe in all kinds of things.
Vishwanathan Anand has indeed spoken very importantly.
Sometimes we listened to the phenomenon of Arjun's life - how his eyes were on the bird's eyes.
Your heart will not be able to pacify yourself if you are mounting books in the last moments.
Let us laugh, let us laugh, let us talk to our friends, let us see that the atmosphere of peace will be created only by that.
You should imagine that you are standing in a pond and beautiful things are visible beneath the lake.
But if suddenly stones were thrown in some water and if jaundice started in the water then what would be the beautiful things that were seen in the lake
If the water is calm then it can be seen as deep as it may be.
But if the water is turbulent then nothing can be seen below.
Then I feel that I will feel better if I get a little lighter.
So I have developed my own technology.
Maybe it is my experience that will be useful to you people.
Silver Agrawal has said a good thing.
Rajat ji has said this very important thing that we should feel light with friends and family members everyday for at least half an hour because most of us want that when we come to the examination then we sit here to count the truth.
We are stuck in it.
Friends, do not do this.
Please come out and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji's words are really understood.
While describing Ramcharitmanas as the present context, he is trying to convey this value to the nation and the world.
Such revered Muraribapu has also sent a very important tip to the students.
And he is not only a teacher but also a thinker. And that is why there is a combination of diversity in his speech.
My experience is that by adopting the situation, we can be very happy and happy.
You will certainly succeed if you move ahead with your passion without load and with a happy mind. And even if you do not succeed, there will be no glacier to lose you and it will be a pride to succeed.
I also express my gratitude to the venerable Murari Babu for giving us a very good message.
Friends, I would like to tell you another thing today.
I can see that the people who have told me their experiences this time have discussed Yoga.
Friends, let me clarify today that it will be injustice to you if you start practicing Yoga tomorrow morning.
However, it is true that be it in the life of students or in the latter part of their lives, Yoga is a big key in the development journey of the people of the country.
Ease of doing business is key.
Look, if you can.
I have a lot of faith in it.
It's not like that.
However, if we read the suggestions then perhaps we cope up with us, yes, it is okay, let's go this way.
And I would urge you to visit this place for five minutes but you must read the instructions.
For the first time when I had read this thing, I felt that it is not for me, but if I read the same thing again then I realized that the question of no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Rao, he stressed on patience.
In very few words too, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Come, listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
My dear brothers and sisters from Bengaluru to C.
N.
R.
Rao speaks.
I believe that it is natural to have anxiety due to exams.
And these are competitive exams.
Don't worry, do good work.
My young friends, I say the same thing.
Remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you too have the right to be here.
You must have perseverance, perseverance and penance.
With such a quality, you will be successful in every exam and other efforts.
Good Blace is the way to talk to a scientist.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
What he had said - dedication, determination, diligence.
Fear will also be frightened if you stay there.
And a golden future is waiting for you to do good work.
Now, on my app, Akademi has delivered a message about the experience of the exam right.
He said that there is a constant effort in his family to create a positive environment during the examination.
This is true, as stated by the Secretary, and also by the Government of India, the Politics Frame of Mind.
We study Thomas Elva edition, a power explorer in our curriculum.
But some friends have imagined that how many years have they taken to do this thing How many times have they been failing, how much time and how much money was spent, how much disappointment it might have been due to failure.
But today this electricity, this bulb brightens our lives.
This is what we call failures as well. The possibilities of success are hidden.
Who doesn't know Srinivas Ramanujan One of the mathematicians of modern times is Indian Mathematician, you will be aware.
His formal education did not include subjects of mathematics, nor did he have any special training.
But he contributed extensively in various fields such as mathematical analysis, number theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example of success that anyone can achieve.
The Harry Potter category is popular all over the world today, but it did not happen in the beginning.
They had to bear many difficulties.
Roling said that he used to devote all his energy to the cause of trouble, which was indeed important for him.
Nowadays, the examinations are conducted not only for the students but also for the entire ideas and for the entire school and teachers.
But the situation is not good without the support of the Vali and the Teacher.
Whether it is a teacher, a guide or a senior student, if all these teams form a unit and move forward in a systematic manner with the same ideas then the examination becomes easy.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App. He has complained that the parents should not put any pressure on their children to bring more marks.
They should be encouraged only for preparation.
If the child is talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Create a smooth environment, create a positive environment, be it your daughter or daughter, see how many confederations come.
You will also be able to see those confederations.
Friends, One thing is certain, especially I want to tell the young friends that the lives of our people have changed a lot more than our old generations.
Each moment, new innovations, new technologies and the ethos of science are visible.
And we are not just overwhelmed.
We also want to move ahead with the pace of science.
I am doing this because today is National Science Day.
The Science Festival of India celebrates 28th February as National Science Day.
28 February, 128 Sir C.
Raman was declared his discovery Ramon Effect.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
Curiosity is the people of science.
And new innovations cannot be possible without science and technology.
Today, on National Science Day, we are focusing on innovation in the country.
Knowledge science and technology should be an integral part of our development journey.
And this is the theme of National Science Day, Make in India Science and Technology Driven Innovations.
Friends, some success is achieved after a long time and whenever success is achieved then the vision of the world changes.
If you are very busy in exams then perhaps you might have noticed many news in your mind.
But I would like to tell the countrymen again.
You must have heard that science has emerged as one of the greatest and most important discoveries in the world.
The scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, something was done and after nearly a hundred years a success was achieved.
Our scientists have discovered the Gravitational Waves.
This discovery is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery does not prove the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This will serve the entire humanity to the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are delighted to note that in the entire process of research, the great scientists of our country were associated with it.
Our scientists will continue to strive to pursue research in future too.
India will also be a partner in international efforts.
And my countrymen, in the last few days, an important decision has been taken.
In order to achieve even greater success in this research, the government has decided to open the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in a hurry called Lego.
India's association will give this process a new strength and a new momentum.
India will surely be an active partner in this great scientific research process of human well-being among its limited resources.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all the scientists.
From time immemorial you can meditate on that number and listen to my Mann Ki Baat.
You will also be able to hear in your mother tongue.
The number of messengers is 8108-8108.
81908-81908. Your examination is in progress.
It is known that tomorrow is the budget.
We all celebrated Christmas on the occasion of the Param Day and are now preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is full of diversity.
In a way every festival waits for another festival.
Sometimes it feels that India is a country where the economy is going through festivals.
This becomes the reason for the economic activities of the poorer sections of the society.
My best wishes to all the citizens of Christmas (Natal) on behalf of me and my best wishes for the new year of 2016.
May the year 2016 bring immense happiness to all of you.
New zeal, new zeal and new resolutions will take you to new heights.
Pune to Shri Ganesh V.
Saveshwarkar has written to me that this season is the season of tourists.
A large number of tourists from India and abroad come here.
People also celebrate Christmas holidays.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the better India's image will be in the world.
I welcome the thoughts of Ganesh ji and convey the message of Ganesh ji to my countrymen.
Anyway, we say Guest Devo Bhav, wherever a guest is to be visited.
At the same time, in our tourist destinations, in the favorite destinations of tourists, in our pilgrimage centres, in fact this is a special emphasis.
However, he is an ordinary worker and works hard and works.
He has done such a wonderful job that the newspaper has published his words.
And when it came to my mind, I also felt that I have brought this thing to you.
In Bhojpura village, he has constructed 100 toilets so far, considering that this work is sacred without his hard work and hard work.
I conclude by congratulating Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear disappointments about the country.
And this is the only thing that keeps the country ahead and it is natural for them to take pride in Mann Ki Baat for Dilip Singh.
This is the result of the untiring efforts of many people that the country is moving very fast.
25 billion Indians are marching ahead on their own by taking steadfast strides.
Better education, better skills and new employment opportunities.
It is a big task to provide easy loans under the Mudra Yojana to those ordinary families who are unable to access the doorsteps of any bank.
Who can forget that incident of Yashoda Mata and Krishna When Balkrishna opened his mouth and showed to Mother Yashoda the whole universe .
The incident of Yoga has made India impatient.
In a way, the issue of cleanliness is echoing at home.
Citizen participation is also increasing.
After so many years of independence, the village where electricity has reached its pillars, the amount of enthusiasm and excitement that is required by the removal of darkness, perhaps we can never imagine the electricity used by the people living in the cities.
Till now, there has not been a widespread discussion in the media, but I am confident that the media will certainly reach such villages. And the biggest benefit will be that the employees of the government, those who are working in this direction will get so much satisfaction that they have done so much that they are going to bring about a change in some village or the other.
Whether the farmers, the poor, the youth or the women, should all these services be provided or not
That is why it should not be reached that what a government has done and what a government has not done.
But therefore, if they are entitled to it, they should not let it go.
Should they also get information about their rights
We should all strive to ensure that the right thing, the good thing, the work done by an individual, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing on my own.
I cannot do anything alone.
But should I do something of what I am doing
An ordinary citizen can also download the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phone and connect with me.
And I keep sharing these small things on it.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people also tell me a lot of things.
How to reach without your help
Come, let us all bring together the interests of the common man in the language of the common man and inspire him to achieve his goodwill.
This was followed by all the departments of the Government.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India is going to launch the entire action plan for Start-up India and Stand-up India.
And in this programme, IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, NITOs and other youngsters from all over the country will be connected to the programme through Live Connectivity.
For example, whether it is a digital world or an IT business, this startup is for them.
No, we have to change it according to the requirements of India.
The market will be available.
Similarly is the intellectual property of our youth less than a few cities .
This thinking is wrong.
The youth of India should have talent and opportunity in every corner of the country.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not be limited to some cities.
And I also urge the state governments to take this forward.
On 16th January, I will definitely be present before you and discuss this in detail and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Ladies and Gentlemen, 12th January marks the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanandji.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanandji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year, it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12 Janaari to 16 January.
And I am aware that this time it is his theme because his theme is based on it. I have been told that more than 10 thousand youths from all corners of India are going to gather here.
Young India is about to create a vision.
In a way, dreams have to be fulfilled.
Resolution is going to be realized.
Can you suggest me about this youth festival
I particularly urge my young friends, my Narendra Modi App.
So I look forward to learning about your thoughts on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, a Visually Challenged Teacher from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, celebrated Excellent India Day at his school.
He telephoned me and expressed his feelings, and celebrated the Excellent India Movement in my school.
We enjoyed schooling and inspired children to help the disabled persons in the society.
I think it was the first time that you had done it.
Dilip ji thank you very much.
And you are working in this area yourself.
You can understand these things very well and if you give them a lot of problems then there will be a lot of problems.
Sometimes when there is an opportunity to meet such a person in the society then there are some ideas in our minds.
We also express our vision of leaving them according to our thinking.
And for such people, many words have been used in the world but contemplation has always been going on with words.
Every time people feel that the identity of this word does not look good for them, it does not seem honourable for them.
When the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan this year, I had to attend the programme.
However, in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially those going there, I could not attend the commencement of this campaign.
But I had to attend that programme. I used to think something in my mind.
So at that time I had come to my mind that the goddess who has given some deficiency to the body, who has done some deficiency, who has done some organ in the right way, who is also called handicapped and knows as a disabled person.
However, sometimes we get to know that we see a deficiency in their eyes but God has given them some special kind of familiarity.
Thereafter, I thought in my mind that with the eyes we feel that it is a handicapped person, but it feels that he has an extra power.
And then I came to my mind as to why not use the word 'divyang' instead of 'divyang' in our country.
These are the people who have organs that have divinity, the transmission of divine divinity, which is not with us, ordinary body.
I like this word very well.
My countrymen, can we preach the word 'Divyang' instead of disability
I hope that you will take this thing forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
It will improve physical and indirect interface and make it accessible for the Divyangjans.
Whether it is schools, bus stations, railway stations or ramps, accessible parking, accessible lifts, braille lips, there are so many things.
In order to make their availability easier, they need innovation, technology, system and sensitivity.
We have taken up this task.
Public participation is also being received.
It should not die in files.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes are easily accessible to those who are entitled to them.
Subsidy is being provided in gas cylinders in our country.
The government has made some changes in it.
Be it Jan Dhan Account or Aadhar Card, the worlds largest logistics Direct Benefit Transfer scheme is directly accessing the bank accounts of beneficiaries.
The scheme is known as the first and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore cooking gas users have become beneficiaries of PAHAL Yojana.
In the bank accounts of 14 crore people, Government money has started going straight into the bank accounts.
No intermediaries, no recommendations are required, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, Aadhaar Card Campaign, on the other hand, Jan Dhan Accounts should be opened, on the other hand, State Government and Government of India should jointly prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiary's accounts through various schemes.
It is estimated that approximately 35-40 projects are being directly incorporated within the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is also a happy coincidence that the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the creator of our Constitution.
In the Parliament, special discussions were held on the Constitution for two days and it was a great experience.
All the parties, all the MPs discussed the sanctity of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, and the correct understanding of the Constitution.
We should take this thing forward.
Can the Republic Day truly connect people with the system
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and the officers are communicated and should be communicated.
However, the Constitution also lays stress on duty and duty.
But it has been observed that the discussion of duties is very low.
Very often when elections are held then there are publications all around, it is written on the walls, it is hoarding that voting is our sacred duty.
There is a lot of duty at the time of voting, but even in a conscientious life why should not it be a duties
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we celebrate 26th January in schools, in our villages, in our cities, in our cities, in different societies and organisations, essay competitions, poetry competitions, oratory competitions etc.
What a big history can accomplish if millions and millions of patriots move forward with their duties
Can you send this to me
I want to know your thoughts.
On my portal, MyGov.
I would definitely like to know what the younger generation of my country thinks about the duties .
I want to make a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, we have statues of all the great men in our city, by citizens, by school children.
And I am not waiting for the government.
Can we make it easier for the society, for the country
On 26th January, we should collectively strive to honour the statues of such great souls, to clean the premises and to ensure that all these things are easily done by the people and by the citizens.
Ladies and Gentlemen, once again, my best wishes for the New Year 2016.
You might have got the opportunity to visit.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business-employment will also be started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas will also begin.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
From every corner of the world, news of natural calamities continues to be heard and news of natural calamities occurs unheard of or thoughtless.
People are also experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
Many people have died.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of grief.
The State Governments are fully supplemented by relief measures.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
Tamil Nadu is now a part of the Government of India.
However, when there is a need to bring about a lot of change in the situation all around.
Fifteen years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector as the maximum natural calamity was confined to the drought.
Today the form of this thing has changed.
At every level, it has become very difficult for us to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens and every small institution will have to work for capacity building in a scientific manner.
After the Nepal earthquake, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
And I suggested that SAARC countries should jointly call for disaster preparedness.
I am happy that a textbook exercise of SAARC countries and a seminar and workshop on Best Practices were concluded in Delhi.
A good start.
Today, I got the phone call of Lakhaninder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I speak from Jalandhar (Lucknow Lakhinder Singh Punjab district).
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people.
I am delighted to hear your message.
Moreover, you are aware of the problems faced by farmers.
And your concern is true, but this does not happen only in Punjab, Haryana.
This is our habit across India and traditionally we are walking on the path of burning the ruins of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
The first solution is to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
The crop residues are also very valuable.
It is an organic fertilizer itself.
We waive it.
And if a small piece of it is made then it becomes a dry fruit for the animals.
Secondly, the upper layer of the ground burns because of the burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, everything should be there but what will happen if the skin above the body burns
We cannot survive even if our hearts are on the move.
The upper layer of our soil burns and pushes our fertile land towards death.
And that is why a positive effort should be made.
It becomes a fertilizer once again when the pieces are buried in the ground.
Or if some water is poured into a pit and poured into it, it becomes the best organic fertilizer.
Moreover, if the fertilizer produced in the soil is not only used for the feeding of the animals but also saves our land then it benefits double the amount.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in banana cultivation.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, he had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand rupees per hectare per hectare.
And till the time those who carried it used to carry the tracker-backters, they used to remain the same.
However, some farmers proved that they had pieces of six-six-eight-eight-inch pieces of this pond and buried it in the ground.
The water that is present in the pit keeps the crop alive.
My dear countrymen, the entire world will remember the International Day of Persons with DCabilities on 3rd December.
Last time, Mann Ki Baat talked about organ donation.
I also discussed the Noto Helpline for the Organ Donation.
2nd November was termed as Indian Organ Donation Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and many eminent personalities attended the function.
Organ donation can save precious lives.
When one organ from the other reaches the body then that organ gets a new life but it gets a new life .
I am confident that this sector will also generate widespread awareness and help the needy better in the true sense as no one can donate it unless it is possible.
I have said earlier that December 3 is celebrated as the day of handicappedness.
He also has an unprecedented courage and abilities, both physically and mentally.
Sometimes they get hurt when they enjoy themselves.
Sometimes a feeling of compassion and kindness is expressed.
But if we change our vision and look at them then these people can inspire us to live.
Something can inspire you to get rid of it.
Even if we face a small problem, we start crying.
And then it reminds me that my problem is very small, how does he manage
And that is why all these things are a source of inspiration for us.
His vision is commendable for redistributing his vision and hardships to his life.
Javed Ahmad, I would like to talk to him today.
40-42 years of age.
In 1967, the terrorists shot dead Javed Ahmed in Kashmir.
The ability to stand on his feet went on forever but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Even the injury of terrorism cannot be defeated.
The body does not support but has been immersed in the study of children for twenty years.
How to improve infrastructure for physically challenged people
How to develop systems for disability in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also turned his studies into that direction.
He is doing a silent revolution today by graduating a Master in social work and becoming a messenger of disabilities as a social worker.
Is the life of Javed enough to inspire every corner of India
I specifically recall the life of Dr. Ambedkar on 3rd December, his penance and dedication.
In the absence of time, I may be talking about Javed but in every corner of India such inspirations are flaring up.
They are spreading new lights and showing ways.
It is an opportunity to draw inspiration from them by remembering everyone like this on 3rd December.
Be it the middle class or the lower middle class or the poor, the oppressed or the deprived sections of the society, the government has been consistently dealing with the systems of governance.
And as a citizen sometimes sometimes somebody feels bad from somebody's government.
And that kind of evil experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout our life.
Sometimes we dont even know because we dont know that it is so comfortable. We dont know that some government system, some government job has been doing this thing.
ASHA workers in our country, which are a network of nationwide.
We must have heard and heard about ASHA workers among the people of India.
However, as a globally renowned family entrepreneur of Bill Gates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
When we had jointly conferred Padma Vibhushan on both these Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
He is a multi-social worker in India.
Whatever he earns during his lifetime, he is using it for the work of the poor.
In the past days, the Government of Odisha has specially honoured ASHA workers on Independence Day.
Engaging them for treatment on the basis of the priorities they have been taught.
Emphasis on the use of insecticides in every household.
For example, Asha Varkar Jamuna Mani Singh is working with dedication to save his entire village from mosquitoes in the same way as his child sleeps properly and takes care of him.
And they fought against Malaria and prepared to fight the entire village.
It will be a matter of great pride.
There will be millions of people around us.
We will look at them with respect.
Such people become such a big dream of our country.
How many great companions of the happiness of the society become.
I salute all such ASHA workers through gemani.
An e-book refers to the inspirational events of Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of MPs and the health sector.
I urge you to look at it.
See not only this but also others.
Read it and you may feel like adding something like this.
So sure you're Mygov.
in.
Such things do not come to our attention very soon but they are true for the society.
Positive is the biggest energy.
Please share good events.
So you can become a social teacher in the true sense.
The temperature of the earth should not increase now .
It is the responsibility and concern of everyone.
And the way to avoid temperatures is the first step.
Energy Conservation is the 14th National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Bulb projects are underway.
Once I had said that on full moon night, lights of light should be shut down and bathed in the moonlight for hours.
It should feel the light of the moon.
And when I got the opportunity to see that a friend had sent me a link then I felt like saying this thing to you.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have had the privilege of being more educated on TV.
However, he is doing such a thing that perhaps no one thinks about it.
He is working to provide light to the poor by using solar energy.
He has formed a committee of women and has set up a plant of solar powered phans.
And they pay lease of 100 rupees per month.
People take fun in the evening and then come back in the morning and give it for charging.
And I have heard that people from 500 households come here in large numbers.
Now look at what the world's largest people might be doing for climate change, however, a young person is doing this thing that inspires everyone.
And Nurjahan means publishing the world.
They are spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjahan and also congratulate i TV because he presented the work that has been going on in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Congratulations a lot.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the Prime Minister how adventurous fans like us are being assisted in the Mudra Bank runs
Mudra promotes business enterprises.
Mudra creates opportunities for earning.
And Mudra empowers in true sense.
The Mudra Yojana is underway to help small adventurers.
However, the speed at which I am going to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has been good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crores under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of 66 lakh women, about 24 lakh are women.
And most of the recipients are SCs, STs and OBCs who work hard to run their families with dignity.
Abhishek has spoken about his own enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news coming to me.
Someone has just told me that there is a sculpture in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he got a loan of Rs. 8 lakh from the bank.
And he started the Suez Drace Safai trading.
During my cleanliness drive, I had said that Swachhata Abhiyan is such that new adventures will be created.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did.
They have brought a tanker and they are working. And I am told that in such a short span of time they have also paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
This is the objective of our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to take more interest.
And the earlier expenditure due to higher interest and other reasons was now saved by saving about one thousand rupees per month due to their fall in their hands.
And a good business of his family also gradually increased.
But I would like that the scheme should be more publicized.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help the smallest of us.
Indeed, these people run the economy of the country.
Small workers are the economic empowerment of the country.
We also insist on this thing.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had discussed Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that need to be constantly awakened in society.
What is the structure of the program .
What is logo
How does public participation increase
I had asked for all these suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are being made.
But I still expect more suggestions.
I am expecting a lot of Chokkas schemes.
And I am told that the participants will get certificates.
It has been announced on some major prizes.
You should also run your creative mind.
How can we make this mantra of unity, Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat a mantra to connect this mantra of unity with one India
Whether it is life-saving or glorious, it is easy to connect with everyone. What should the government do
What should the society do
What should civil society do
There can be a lot of things.
I am sure your suggestions will be useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has arrived.
I would urge you to use this good weather for some time to keep the body healthy.
And make the atmosphere within the family itself, be it a family festival or be it an hour or an hour or so, all of you have to do it together.
You see how consciousness comes and how much body supports the whole day.
So if it is a good season then good habits will also fall.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jai Hind...
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all.
Once again I have got the opportunity to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to play the fifth day match in Mumbai.
This category has been named Gandhi-Mandela category.
And that is why the significance of the last match has increased a lot.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Akashwani Kannur Kendra.
I would like such Akashwani Kendras across the country to focus on such awareness and active people in their respective areas so that our objective of running the country with public participation will get a new strength.
And therefore I congratulate all the friends of Kannur Akashwani Kendra from the bottom of my heart.
Students from St. Mary Upper Primary School, Chittor have written to me in Kerala.
The letters are special in many ways.
First of all, these girls have drawn a picture of Mother India with her thumb impression.
I have sent a picture of the map of India.
At first I was surprised to know why he had maped India with his thumb impression.
But when I read his letter, I realized how good a reflective message he had delivered.
These are the girls who have tried to create awareness about the Prime Minister.
He has been running a public awareness campaign for organ donation.
He has also staged plays at various places to understand the organ donation among the people.
Organ donation should be a tendency and a tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter urging people to donate organs in your Mann Ki Baat.
He added that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I received a lot of messages on phone calls too.
Devesh ji of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
The ambitious goal of donating organs by every ten lakh persons is a very productive step taken by the government.
I feel this thing is very important.
More than 2. 5 lakh kidneys, hearts and liver donations are required every year in the country.
However, in the country of 1. 25 billion people, we can achieve only five thousand transplants.
One lakh eyesight is required every year.
And we can reach up to twenty-five thousand only.
We can only give one to the requirement of four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have tried their best to bring it faster by reducing the writing.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the forefront of organ donation.
Several social institutions and many voluntary organizations have been doing well in this direction.
National Organ and Tease Transplant Organisation (NOTO) has been set up to promote organ transplantation.
A Helpline 1800 1140 services are also available for 24 hours.
And we have been told there that is Tyaketan Bhujitha.
This is the best description of the joy of sacrifice in Tyaketan Bhujitha Mantra.
A few days ago, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Let us imbibe the spirit of Organ Donation Mahadan, the spirit of Tyaketan Bhujitha.
Ladies and Gentlemen, recently we celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And a few days later, I will also celebrate Diwali.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh Chaturthi is also celebrated.
India-Africa Foreign Summit is being organized in New Delhi, the capital of India from 26th to 2nd October.
This is the first time that such a massive event is being organized on the soil of India.
Choppan leaders from African countries and associations have been invited.
A PACCI Conference is being organised outside Africa for the largest conference of African countries.
India-Africa relations are strong.
The population of African countries is equal to the population of India.
And if we mix both then we are the third largest population of the world.
And it says that lakhs of years ago this was the only land.
Later, these two fragments of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have such a closeness in our natural resources.
And nearly 2 lakh people of India have been living in this country for a long time.
India enjoys economic relations with African countries, cultural and political ties.
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of most African countries.
Human Resource Development, Capacity Building and more than 25,000 African students are studying in India.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have studied in India.
So how close are our dances
And in that sense, this Summit is very important.
Generally, when the Summit meets, the Heads of States meet.
Similarly, the Heads of the Summit are scheduled to meet.
But it is our endeavor that there should be a mix of people in it.
Around six hundred schools participated in it.
It also had schools outside India and India.
And thousands of school children wrote about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition titled 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, mobile exhibition is reaching Delhi from Porbandar to the state of North on October 29.
Lakhs of school children witnessed this exhibition.
The people of the village witnessed and how Mahatma Gandhi had played an important role in the relations between Africa and India, and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on the planet.
Children from schools in our smaller places are also very vibrant, they see how broad they are and they think so deeply.
As such, this summit is from India-Africa, but we clearly see how opportunities are created for people to join.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time in August 15th, I had made a proposal for the MP Model Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, a lot of Parliamentarian friends have fulfilled this task.
He was very conscious.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal.
Wherever ideal villages are being built, the Sarpanchs there, the collectors there, some MPs, the Government of India, the State Government, all of them together discussed the issue of Model Gram Yojana in detail.
Various kinds of innovative things were noticed and encouraging things were discovered.
I would like to bring some of these things to your notice.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very large region, a tribal area.
He chose the Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kundi district of Jharkhand to be an ideal village.
It was difficult for the government employees to go there too.
I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Karia Mundaji.
And in a way, it teaches children early in the morning and educates children in the evening.
And about five hundred fifty illiterates were educated by these children.
If we look at this thing then we can see that there is no budgetary system in the society, no journal, no specific system but what a big change can be brought about by the will power of the Pudi Gram Panchayat.
This village is known for the manufacture of Sherdi and for the Kurtai jaggery in the kingdom.
Shriman Ruvalaji launched the Kurtayi Gol Sherdi Festival in this village on 11th March.
People from old public life also came here.
An exhibition was also organized to increase the sale of sugarcane.
How to make the village a hub of economic activity, how to sand the sale of village products.
Shriman Ruvalaji is indeed a complimentary officer for his efforts to build a self-sufficient village along with an ideal village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and not of cleanliness
Savita Rai, Mumbai has sent a telephone message to me: We are cleaning our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
This Diwali will not only clean the atmosphere outside our homes but also keep it clean even after Diwali.
He has pointed towards the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to recall you, after the festivals of Diwali last year, the media of our country, especially the media, had launched a massive campaign.
All the media persons carried out an awareness campaign.
And the result was that after Diwali a clean drive was underway.
Savita ji is true that we should do whatever we worry about before the festival even after the festival.
Every public event should be organized.
And today I especially congratulate the entire media of India.
I was fortunate to have participated in the Safiri Sammelan organised by India to Day Group on the second October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He gave the Clean India Awards and I was also watching how many activities are going on.
For this, how people themselves are working like One Like One Mission.
What are the places in our country that have been kept so clean
All these things came to light and I concluded my heartfelt thanks to the commendable work of the India to Day Group at that time.
Through e-TV, they have been continuously encouraging cleanliness for the last one year.
He has added 51 lakh children of about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places or stations or religious places or hospitals or gardens, a massive campaign of cleanliness has been carried out in many places.
Now these news reports show the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat by themselves.
Mission Clean India is the hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of newspapers and thousands of newspapers. I cannot mention the names of all but everyone has run this campaign.
Therefore, according to the suggestion made by Savita Rai ji, today the entire country is considering this thing as its own and is carrying it forward.
I have written to our Governor of Meghalaya, His Excellency Shanmugnath.
And through this letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has raised the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he was awarded the Cleanest Village in Asia.
I am glad to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in the remote North East in our country which has been engaged in the field of sanitation for years.
It has become a habit for the citizens of that place and it has become a village culture.
This is the only thing that instills confidence in all of us that our country will be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we can proudly say that as well as hundreds of millions and millions of Indians who have freed our Mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that certain things have become a corruption house.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know about the recommendations of anybody, he doesnt have to face any kind of difficulties and how the brokers hire money.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who keeps completely testing a person in a two-minute interview.
And I was wondering why should we not abolish the tradition of interviews for small jobs
My dear young friends, today I proudly say that the government has completed all the processes and the recruitment of the Central Government's Group D Group C and Group B on non-gazetted posts will no longer be taken into consideration.
The Rules will come into force from 1st January, 2016.
We will not interfere in the ongoing process but it will be implemented from 1st January 2016.
So my best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we have announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered as a medium of economic security.
The keys of critical times are considered gold.
This tradition has been going on in social life for centuries.
Under this, you can deposit your gold into a gold bank and the bank will pay interest on it, the amount you get and the interest you get.
Earlier we used to keep the gold in the locker and we had to pay the locker.
Now I will put the gold into the bank and the bank will pay you as interest.
Say , Gold can't become wealth anymore .
Can gold change in the form of a living force from the dead money or not
We have to do the same thing and give me support.
Now do not keep gold at home .
Its safety and interest, two benefits.
Definitely take advantage.
There is another scheme - Sovereign gold bond in which you dont have gold bond but a paper comes in your hands.
However, the price of this paper is just as much as one gold and the amount of gold that you will return on that day will be the same.
So we are launching these schemes.
Now we will not need to buy gold.
So, this scheme, which guarantees security, will be presented to the countrymen in the coming days.
I am glad to say that we are bringing some golden coin with Ashoka Chakra.
It has been almost 70 years since our independence, but till now we have been using only one foreign golden corner or the golden bullion bars.
Why should not our country be independent
Therefore, in the coming weeks and before density, it will be available to the common citizens of Dhanteras and Indian gold coins of five grams and ten grams of Ashoka cycle are being started.
Besides, 20 grams of gold bulbs will also be made available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new dimension towards economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on 31 October, the birth anniversary of Lohpurush Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The map of unbroken India comes out remembering Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
He showcased his strength as an iron man.
We will not only pay our homage to Sardar Saheb but also his dream of uniting India which he had shown in a geographical way. But this mantra of unity should always be a medium of our thinking, behaviour and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Our country is full of different creeds, sects, dialects, different castes, different dresses and diversity and this diversity is due to which our beauty lies.
If this diversity were not there then perhaps we could not have taken pride in the splendor that we take pride in.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, Run for Unity programmes are being organised across the country on 31st October.
I have heard that it is being organized all around this time too.
People are preparing to run for unity with enthusiasm.
The race for unity is in the true sense of development.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race for unity.
Let us pay tributes to Sardar Saheb.
Promote the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain on the second day of Diwali.
I am very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such sections of the society, be it Dalits or tribals or be it backwards or be it their brightest children who are taught foreigners.
I believe that this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre and a land of inspiration when such children of India will visit Britain.
And that is why I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
And now that building is being built for the wealth of crores of countrymen and if the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar is associated with it then you can imagine how happy it will be for people like me.
I will also have another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Basveshwara.
The work that Lord Basveshwara had done for democracy and women empowerment several years ago is truly a studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Basveshwara at the house of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought centuries ago.
You are aware that when such incidents are connected then the hearts of all our countrymen get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, the akashvani of your letters is also discussed.
Government officials are being called and discussed.
Some people write their problems and also try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
However, a good bond has been established between us.
Last year I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the New Year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
There has been a basic idea in my life and because of that I have had immense faith in the power of the people. However, I can say with the knowledge and experience that we think that more peoples power is immense than that.
Our ancestors used to say that Janardhan is a part of God.
I can tell from my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have a great power and a great truth because I have realized that I used to ask for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and I used to talk about two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to keep telling me that this is a great power.
Yes, lakhs of letters have also given me a great reading.
Different departments of the government have analyzed the letters of the people and what are the matters of policy, what is the matter of personal question, what is the matter that the government does not care about
Who had thought that the source of these information would become Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that Selfie with Doctor and the whole world was surprised.
Perhaps somebody in all the countries of the world had the distinction of being selfie with doctor and daughter in the number of lakhs.
And when she used to do selfie with the doctor, she used to enhance her daughter's zeal but she also made her commitment.
Even when people were looking at it, it seemed that neglect of girls would have to be avoided now.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind Indias tourism, I had told the same citizens that if you are going to Incredible India, if you have a good picture then send it.
This kind of pictures were sent to every corner of India in the number of lakhs. Perhaps the tourism department of the Government of India and the tourism department of the state government had never thought that we had such a beautiful legacy.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is it not time for Khadi for fashion
Today, I can say with satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year. Now this work has not been done due to some government advertisement.
On a TV channel, I had seen a retired teacher standing on a widow line to release the subsidy.
The common man of the society, the lower middle class, for whom it is difficult to quit the subsidy, but these people leave it.
Is this not a silent revolution
Is not this the philosophy of the people
Governments must also learn the teachings that the work that is being done in our government offices is a capable, energetic and determined society of mass power outside the Umbrah.
He made every small thing his own and tried to connect himself for the betterment of the country.
What could be more satisfaction than this
This time I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I had prayed to the citizens of the country that by telephoneing, you should mention your questions and suggestions.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a pleasant experience.
People of all ages have conveyed their message.
I liked to hear some messages myself, I liked it.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken one minute or two minutes but for me your phone call is very important.
The entire government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing remains astonishing and enjoyable for me.
However, it seems that there is negativeness and negativeness around.
But my experience was different.
These fifty five thousand people had to speak in their own way.
But I am surprised that all the things were similar in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Totally positive, informative, creative.
People have said that more than one percent of the remaining energy filled and enjoyed things.
They must have heard the radio.
I was told that how important radio would be for the blind people.
I see a new dimension and I have said so good things that these people and the government are sufficient to be sensitive.
Pawan Acharya has conveyed to me a message from Alwar Rajasthan.
Listen to what he wants to say - "Maru is a Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I believe that your feelings like wind will definitely reach every corner of India.
It has been suggested that the soil should not be rooted and that is why soil lamps are also precious.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
Whether it is our navy, ground force, air force, navy that protects water, land and ocean.
The war that took place in 1965, ended 50 years with Pakistan.
On this occasion, a Shouryanjali exhibition has been set up at India Gate in Delhi.
If we look at history from the point of view of history then we can learn a lot and if we look for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no greater inspiration than this for serving the motherland.
Whether it is from Hajipir or from the North or from the Chamindan or from the Hajipir, it is a thrilling thing and it is a matter of pride for our soldiers.
My meeting with these brave families was also with the families of those who sacrificed their lives. Those who took part in the war are also in the Northern era of life.
If you want to make history then it is important to understand history in depth.
I have returned in two and a half hours but it will take you three-four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a young child has instructed the elder Prime Minister but he has forgotten to call his name in haste.
We should also create a habit of cleanliness and a system for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from this child's message.
I have to hear a lot too.
I can see the best thing from this thing that the Parliament of the country is also discussing about cleanliness of India.
And on the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the other hand, both the children of this country talk about cleanliness. What could be the privilege of a big country
The movement that is underway, the atmosphere of hatred towards dirt, the awareness about cleanliness, the governments will also be compelled to work, it will provide a platform to them.
And this India, in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, let us work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi. And you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
Once he had said: If I want to choose one of the two things for freedom and hygiene, I would like cleanliness first. After independence, Gandhi was more important than independence.
Gulshan Arora Ji from Delhi has sent a message on Maya Gau.
He has written that he wants to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men always remain a source of inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to evaluate the ideas that our work was for the great man.
You make any date, you will find the name of some great person out of the windows of history.
In the coming days, let us recall all these great men, let us take the message of their lives to every household and let us also try to learn something from it.
I particularly urge you once again for the 2nd October.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes, all kinds of fabrics, many things but it should also have a place for Khadi.
Once again I have said that Khadi gets discounted from 2nd October to 1 month.
We should take advantage of it.
And along with Khadi, the handloom should also be given the same importance.
And that is why we must give Khadi a place in our homes and place it on our body in Diwali.
And selling almost doubled while watching.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot do with the publicity of billions of rupees has been done by you people with a small help.
This is the strength of the people. Therefore, I once again urge you to do this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a great pleasure in my heart.
You must also feel like enjoying this joy.
I had visited Kolkata in May and had come to meet the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
His brother Chandra Bose organized everything.
I had the pleasure of spending a happy evening with the family members of Subhas Babu for a long time.
You can imagine how happy it would be for me .
Perhaps for the first time in his life, the family members of Netaji would have gone to Vadapradhan Niwas.
But more than that, it is a matter of great happiness for me that such a hospitality would never have been fortunate to be received at the Prime Ministers residence in October.
More than 50 people of Subhas Babu's family live in different countries and everyone is coming specially.
I got a message from the desperate corner and listening to its voice, I felt like a leader himself and perhaps he would become a leader.
MARU NAME BHARGVI KANDADED
I would like to make a statement to the Prime Minister that you awaken the youth about the registration of water so that the participation of the youth in the coming days increases and the important support of the youth in the future is in selecting and running the government.
Every voter in a democracy has the fortune of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we saw that our Election Commission has been functioning as a mere regulator but in the last few years it has undergone a major change.
Today, our Election Commission has not only become a regulator but has become a facilitator in a way that has become a voter friend and has become a voter friend in all its thought processes.
Electoral lists should be upgraded and we should also keep examining.
I am telling you during the elections that after the first polling, water consumption is taking place.
How sacred it is, everyone should do it.
On the eve of Param Day, I visited Kashi.
I got a student of the seventh grade named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh grade edition of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is very sharp intellect.
But at such a young age, I have seen his innovation in physics research.
Brothers and sisters, how did he get sensitivities in robots, what was he talking about
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child .
How to reach
When .
This child should ask his mind.
Similarly, I had to meet a very small child Sonam Patel.
He is nine years old.
She is the daughter of a very poor family of Sadabrij Patel, a Sundarpur resident of Varanasi. And I was surprised to know that her childhood song is a fool.
But the biggest thing I felt was that whenever I asked him, he used to shloka, he used to interpret in English, he used to define it, he used to speak in Hindi.
Do you read only the Gita or else the other is Bhavna .
If you take history, you will face it in the evening.
We all are surprised that how talented he is in the whole family
I was really impressed.
Some children sometimes have the hobby of celebrity but Sonam does not have this kind of thing.
We do a lot of things besides watching TV and reading news papers and sometimes we also enjoy such things.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that in Mann Ki Baat some people come forward with a lot of help for me.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to do so much rubbish to do it once a month, I have to do so much good by spending time.
Sometimes my colleagues from Akashwani have to wait for half-a-half hours.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestions.
Now it is only a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used radio
He started his radio from Germany and continued to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio from a weekly news bulletin.
He used to play these radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto, Urdu.
It has been a year since I was talking about Mann Ki Baat on Akashwani.
I am also talking about you and this is my satisfaction.
I will meet again for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution is very valuable for me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modis Mann ki Baat
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Once again I got the opportunity to come amongst you for Mann Ki Baat.
In the remotest provinces, people are celebrating Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
In keeping with the social security scenario, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, everyone has accepted these schemes in a big way.
I had a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give this security scheme to our sisters.
Eleven crore families have joined this scheme since the inception of this scheme.
Moreover, I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, as I was talking to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in a big way.
Whether the work that has not been done for sixty-seven years will happen soon or not
I also saw the richness of the poor
He had to open an account with zero balance.
However, the poor saved Rs. 22 thousand crores.
Employment has been provided to the youth.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, one lakh twenty one thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
It is not just about opening accounts and stopping them.
And now thousands of people have become entitled to overdraft under the Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And the belief that the poor can get money from the bank was also born.
I have brought it to you and now it is your job to maintain it.
Our accounts should be active.
You will certainly do this, I am confident.
Last days, the events of Gujarat, the sounds of violence, made the entire country restless.
But in a very short span of time, all my enlightened citizens of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
The situation was disrupted earlier and once again Gujarat was on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brotherhood this is the right path.
And we have to walk steadfastly on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And where is the truth, I got the opportunity to listen to those kinds of things that I felt like singing music in a way.
I felt very nice.
Perhaps it is most essential to take the true nature of Islam to the world.
I believe that the love and generosity associated with the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that we may believe in any sect but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate to have another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
In India, scholars from the Buddhist traditions of many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru Bodh Gaya, the first Prime Minister of India.
I will have the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya along with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you something specially today.
I have already mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard from me in Parliament, you must have heard in public meetings, you must have heard in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the Government is open to debates on the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of the farmers and I have repeatedly said that.
However, today I have to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the issue of amendment in the Land Acquisition Act has come through the states. I have urged the poor farmers of the country to set up canals to provide water to the fields, to set up pillars to provide electricity to the villages, to construct roads for the villages, to build houses for the poor people of the villages, to provide employment to the poor youth of the villages.
And then there was a proposal for reform.
But I saw that so much fear was spread, Kisan was so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, my farmer should not be confused and fear should never happen.
And I dont want to give any such opportunity to anyone who scares the people and misleads the people.
We had introduced an Ordinance.
The Ordinance is being concluded tomorrow, the 23rd August.
And I have decided that it should be abolished.
It means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But one of these things was incomplete.
And that is why we brought them in the Ordinance but due to these arguments these matters have also gone wrong.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that for us Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a slogan but it is our mantra.
Welfare of Village, Poor Farmers.
And that is why on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Kisan and Welfare will be formed.
And when it comes to the 1965 war then it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to remember Jai Jawan- Jai Kisan Mantra.
Its very natural to remember all those martyrs who have kept the Tricolour Flag of India alive.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 War.
And I am happy that India has been doing excellent work in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to find out how to make these researches reach the common man .
How to convert principles into tools
How to connect labs with land
We have to take it forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an extremely inspecting for me.
And last time I had said in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting I feel that there are many opportunities and possibilities.
I get several letters from the citizens.
Skill Development has been written.
Shri Prakash Tripathi from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
My young friends have also talked about one thing.
On 15th August, I had asked from above the Red Fort why the interviews for lower level jobs
And when there is an interview call then where will every poor family, widow, emotions meet Who will get the job with the help of whom
The poor will not have to run for emotions.
There should be no exploitation, no corruption.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the sake of health, particularly for maternal mortality and child mortality, the call-to-action for its action plan was taken together by twenty-four countries of the world to think of Indias soil.
This is the first time outside the United States of America that this programme has been organized in any other country.
However, improvements have increased considerably.
India has also started to appreciate internationally, but this figure is not small.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the deaths of mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue keeps coming.
I am sure Dengue is dangerous but it is easy to save.
And it is directly related to the Swachh Bharat scheme that I am talking about.
We see advertising on TV.
There is widespread public education in this regard, but we do not pay attention.
I would urge you all to say that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Depression regarding water, hygiene and hygiene are not the reasons for death.
Free Dengue testing facilities are available at about five hundred fourteen centres across the country.
Cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, there is a festival in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why should not every festival of ours be joined with cleanliness now
You see, culture will become that nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart the spirit of serving the tribals of India is strong.
These two brothers have made India proud.
These two brothers won the race this year.
India's honour has increased.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am happy to note that his entire mission is Team India - Vision for Tribal with the intention of getting rid of tribals.
See, what efforts are everybody making in their own way to further the country
Whenever we hear such incidents, our chest swells.
Sometimes, due to perception, we do injustice to our fellow citizens.
My experiences with regard to the apostles are different.
Sometimes we talk to the audience and we also learn a lot.
I have met many such people who say, "Brother, I have lived in life for a sand on cycle".
Some people say that I keep a cycle day in a week.
Today, I specially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now it will become the magnificent, divine and inspirational monument of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
When Indians travelling all over the world will go to London then the memorial that Babasaheb Ambedkar had to build there will be an inspiration for us.
I salute the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Once again after a long gap, we are starting Mann Ki Baat amongst you, peoples talk, peoples talk and public opinion.
Sitting in the midst of them, as a family member of 130 crore Indians, he used to listen and repeat many things and sometimes our own things became an inspiration for us.
You can imagine how this mid-term might have been.
Perhaps this was not a live programme.
I was doing a miss every moment and when I am doing Mann Ki Baat, I may say, Words may be mine, Voice is mine but the story is yours, the words are yours, the strength is yours.
I used to use only my words, my words and because of that I was not missing you for this programme.
There was an emptiness.
But this Sunday was a long wait.
Well, we have finally got the opportunity.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, Small, Small, Social and Living are the reasons for change.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new feeling and in a way supports the concept of New India.
I feel the sameity.
Sometimes I feel that this is my self-confidence visit.
This is my journey from Aham to Vayama.
For me, my silent conversation with you was in a way part of my spiritual journey.
Several people have asked me a lot of questions as to why I was going to Kedarnath in the race for elections.
Most of them have given a political meaning.
It was an occasion for me to meet you all.
The rest is your curiosity, I think that I will discuss it sometimes.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way your effort to strengthen a positive thing and I have been feeling it continuously in your words.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are totally different from the regular government functioning.
Sometimes my thought process is being carried forward in a few words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then they are showing disillusionment with dirt but they also explain the efforts of cleanliness.
The experiments he has himself experimented with depicting the imaginations he has observed in his mind.
That is, in a way, I have been exploring the way the solutions of the problems are being solved across the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like Arisha for the country and society.
It shows us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent within our countrymen.
It is necessary to strengthen and encompass the talent and provide opportunities and enforce it.
Mann Ki Baat also tells that all the 130 crore Indians want to connect with the country's development with strength and activeness. And I will definitely say one thing that such letters come to me in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls come, so many messages come. However, the grievances are very low and if someone has asked for himself, I have not come to my mind in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how much joy will be in my heart.
I have not come here, you have brought me, you have settled me and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, let us move ahead with the sequence of Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever there was a crisis in the country, its opposition was not confined to the political sphere, it was not confined to the politicians, the movement was not confined to the jails.
There was an anger in the hearts of the people.
The lost democracy was a thirst.
Normally, the fun of democratic rights in normal life is known only when a democratic right is snatched away.
Every citizen of the country began to feel that something has been stripped of it.
Perhaps in a country of the world, every person of the country has voted for democracy without considering his remaining rights and requirements.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the massive election campaign was concluded in our country, from the rich to the poor, everybody was willing to make a difference to the future of our country with happiness in this festival.
Whenever any thing is very close to us, we understand its importance and its amazing facts are also ignored.
This number may seem very ordinary to us but if I say that if we give up China then in India more than any country in the world voted.
The number of voters who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of the entire Europe.
This indicates the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
Election to the 2019 Lok Sabha was the largest democratic election in the world in history.
You can imagine how big sources and manpower are required to finish such elections.
The election was possible due to the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff day and night.
In order to successfully conclude this great Democracy, when nearly 3 lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces took up their responsibilities, 20 lakh police personnel of different states also worked hard.
As a result of the hard work done by these people, this time more than the previous elections were held.
You can imagine about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines across the country for voting.
All this has been done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his right.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was set up for only one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel there for two-two days. This is the true honour of democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
The center of the poll is located at an altitude of 150000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is one more pride filled with pride in the election.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted enthusiastically like men.
The percentage of voting for women and men was almost equal in this election.
One more encouraging fact is that today there is a record 8 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the electoral process and salute the vigilant voters of India.
My dear countrymen, many times you would have heard from my mouth that Book na Book was my request that we can give books instead of flowers in our reception.
Since then, people have started giving books to many places.
Someone has recently given me a book titled Premchand ki Popular Kahani, I feel very good.
Although it was not possible for a long time, but during the tour I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories of expression of human sensibilities in simple language also touched my heart.
His interactions involve the spirit of the whole of India.
When I was reading the story of intoxication written by him, my mind was going on in its own way on the economic imbalances of society.
I remembered the days of my youth as to how discussions were going on overnight.
One can learn from the story of the brave sons of the landlord and the heroes of the poor family that if you are not cautious then the impact of the bad world will come to an end.
The second episode that touched my heart was Idgah.
The sensitivity of a child, his sincere love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches her grandmother with a chip from the fair, she is truly at the peak of human sensitivity.
In this context, a live picture of the difficulty in the lives of the poor farmer was seen.
Despite the loss of their crops, the farmers are glad that they will not have to sleep in the fields in the cold.
Though this story is about a century ago, its relevance still reflects.
I had a different kind of experience after reading it.
Whenever there was talk of reading, I used to read in some media about Kerala's letter library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated in the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of the primary school here, P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked hard for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here tied in bottles and loaded on their backs.
Today, this library is showing a new direction to everyone along with tribal children.
Vanche Gujarat Mission was a successful experiment in Gujarat.
Lakhs of people from every age group participated in this mission of reading books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time out and place books in your daily routine.
You will actually enjoy a lot and you must write on the Narendra Modi App so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are considering the issue which is a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov. And I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitashu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many people have written to me about water related challenges besides Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water is very important in our culture.
Water is the source of energy, that is, water is the power that gives life.
Like your mother, bless you and shower your blessings on us year after year.
The deficiency of water affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received by rain during the entire year is saved in our country.
Only 8.
Now the time has come for this problem to be resolved.
I believe that like many other problems, we will solve this crisis with the help of peoples participation, with the peoples power, with the capabilities, cooperation and determination of 125 crore Indians.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
This will result in faster decision-making on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I have written to the Sarpanches across the country, to the villagers.
I have written to the Gram Pradhan that he should sit with the villagers and discuss the issue of water conservation, water conservation and rainwater conservation.
I am glad that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month, crores of people in thousands of Panchayats performed Shramdaan.
People in the village took a pledge to collect one drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to share with you one sarpanch.
The people there are ready to play their active role in conserving water once again.
My best wishes to every village Prime Minister and every Sarpanch for their activeness.
There are several sarpanches across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation.
In a way it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now competing for constructing a water temple in their village.
As I said, many positive outcomes of collective efforts can be achieved.
There can be no formula for water crisis across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But everyone's goal is to save water and conserve water.
Drinage lines are being set up in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
The construction of the tank at Themaipalli in Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the village.
A major change has come from the small ponds built in fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women came together to revive the Naga river.
I have also read about those women from Garhwal who have been working very well in the field of rainwater harvesting.
I believe that several such efforts are being made and when we work together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will join, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the people of the country.
My initiatives are an urgent urge: just as the countrymen converted cleanliness into a mass movement, similarly, we should launch a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us collectively pledge to save every drop of water. And I believe that water is the Prasad of God, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier it was said that the touch of Paras makes iron gold.
I say that water is drained and a new life is created by the touch of water.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about water related problems and also propagate solutions for water conservation.
I particularly urge the leaders of different sectors to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is the field of films, sports, friends from the media, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, people with stories and stories, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
May the society be replaced, may the society be connected, may the society be connected.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My dear countrymen, there have been several traditional methods for conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the place of birth of venerated Bapu, then there is the second house behind the venerable Bapus house, there is a 200-year-old water tank there. And even today there is water supply system in it.
There will be several such experiments everywhere.
Let us inspire people for water conservation by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You can share your content using JanShakti4JalShakti Heshtag.
My dear countrymen, I also express my gratitude to the people of the world for one thing.
Once again on 21st June, three-three generations of each family came together to celebrate Yoga Day with zeal and enthusiasm.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care is increasing due to the importance of Yoga Day.
In every corner of the world, if a Yoga lover welcomes him as soon as the sun rises, it is the entire journey till the sun rises.
Perhaps there would be such a place where there is no human being or associated with Yoga, Yoga has taken such a big shape.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from AC gyms to a penetrating desert, from villages to cities, from places wherever possible, not only Yoga was performed but it was also collectively celebrated.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent dignitaries and common citizens of many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
On that day, the world was looking like a very happy family.
We all know that for building a healthy society there is a need for healthy and sensitive people and Yoga ensures that.
Therefore, propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service.
The announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been conferred to those organisations across the world whom you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly in the propagation of Yoga.
Take the example of 'Japan Yoga Niketan', which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses, or many other MSMEs.
Take the name of Antonietta Rozzi, who started the Sarva Yoga International and propagated Yoga throughout Europe.
It is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a subject related to Yoga then can Indians lag behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also been honoured and have been dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and set up a Jewish Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
The comprehensive celebration of Yoga and the honour of those who spread the message of Yoga at home have made Yoga Day special.
Joining your thoughts is a great journey for me. Mann Ki Baat is a milestone.
Let us continue to talk.
Keep listening to your feelings, be honest and understanding.
Sometimes we keep trying to live those feelings.
May your blessings continue.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us collectively enjoy Mann Ki Baat and fulfil the responsibility of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
These valiant heroes sacrificed their lives for the protection of crores of Indians.
My countrymen, these brave sons had united day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in Pulwama terror attack, the hearts of the people and the people of the country are shocked and angry.
All the sympathies of the martyrs and their families have emerged.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who laid down their lives while defending Mother India.
We all have to face the challenges faced by the country by forgetting racism, communalism, territorialism and all other differences so that our stance towards terrorism is stronger than ever before.
Our Armed Forces have been showcasing unparalleled courage and might since time immemorial.
He unanimously demonstrated the immense potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also been given answers in their language.
You must have seen what steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has pledged to destroy the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring work of their family members through the medium of broadcast has given strength and courage to the entire nation.
Ramniranji, the father of Ratan Thakur, the martyr of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires all of us in this hour of grief.
He has said that he will also send his second daughter to fight against the enemies and if necessary, he will fight for himself.
The entire nation is saluting the indomitable courage of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, wife Meenaji.
He has also pledged to recruit one of his daughters in CRPF.
When the Parthiv Deh of Martyr Vijay Soren reached Gumla in Triranga and reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his mother-in-law said, I too will join the army.
The spirit of this Masum reflects the feelings of each and every child of India.
Similar feelings are seen in the homes of our brave martyrs.
I urge the younger generation to know and understand the spirit and sentiments that these families have shown.
We will not need to go towards the ancient incident of history to know what is sacrifice and penance.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty ji of Udupi Karnataka expressed his happiness over the formation of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised and painful that there was no National War Memorial in India.
It is such a memorial that the stories of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation can be kept alive.
I ensured that there should be such a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial. And I am glad that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on the 25th of February, we will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our Armed Forces.
The country will make such a small effort to repay its debt.
A new memorial has been built just near the heart of Delhi, where India Gate and Amar Jawan Yojana have come up.
I am confident that it would be appropriate for our countrymen to visit this National Soldier Memorial at any place of pilgrimage.
This National Soldier Memorial is a reflection of the nations gratitude towards the brave soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice since independence.
The design of the memorial showcases the indomitable courage of our brave soldiers.
Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldiers.
The second Circle is the bravery cycle that shows the courage and valour of the soldiers.
Thereafter there is a sacrifice cycle.
The Circle showcases the sacrifices of soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the nation are written in golden letters.
The defence cycle then demonstrates safety.
The circle contains dense trees.
On one hand, the identity of the National Military Memorial will emerge as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country with the aim of studying them in order to express their gratitude.
Those who laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be secured and developed.
It is not possible to express in words the great contributions of our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary Forces towards the development of the country.
In October last year, I was fortunate to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This is also a reflection of our thoughts under which we believe that the nation should be grateful to the men and women police personnel who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope that you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, thousands of your letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat keep reading through different mediums.
When I was reading your comments this time, I came across a very interesting note from Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He writes that when the British captured Birsa Munda on March 3, 2000, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also celebrated on 3rd March as the birth anniversary of Jamshed ji.
He further writes that these two personalities are entirely from different familial landscapes that enrich the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is appropriate to salute the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have illuminated not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youth need some inspirational personality to guide them, it is Bhagwan Birsa Munda.
When he was asleep, the British hid and caught him with a lot of humor.
Do you know why the British had resorted to such cowardly acts
Because the British were afraid of such a big empire.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda had stirred up the British rule with guns and cannons only through his traditional architecture.
In fact, when people get an inspiring leadership, the collective will power of the people is overpowered.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda had not only fought for political freedom against the British.
But they also fought for the socio-economic rights of the tribals.
They have done this in their short lives.
He shone like a sun in the dark life of the deprived and the oppressed.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 years.
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
No part of India will be like this, no one has contributed to this struggle of freedom for centuries.
But unfortunately, their sacrifices, valour and sacrifices do not reach the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda gave us an idea of his existence then a great personality like Jamshed ji Tata gave the country big institutions.
Jamshed ji was a true visionary, who not only saw the future of India but also laid the foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a centre of science technology and industries for the future.
K, which led to the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on 22nd February.
You all are aware that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, a man of comfort and peace, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is the only record of presenting the highest budget in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India in such a difficult time when the country's democratic tensions were threatened.
Morarjibhai Desai jumped into a movement against Emergency to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price even in old age.
The government of that time arrested him and imprisoned him.
However, in 1997, when people won the election, they became the Prime Minister of the country.
The Amendment also provides that even the fundamental rights conferred under sections 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be abusive.
For the first time, it was made that the President would announce the Emergency only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet and it was also decided that the deadline for the Emergency shall not be extended for more than six months at one time.
Similarly, Morarjibhai ensured that the manner in which democracy was slaughtered by the Emergency in the year 15 could not be repeated in the future.
Generations to come will always be remembered for their invaluable contribution in maintaining the month of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity in the public about the Padma awards.
Today, we are moving ahead on the path of a New India, we want to honour those people who have been doing their work negligently at the grassroots level.
Through their hard work, those who are bringing a positive change in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, he is a true Karmayogi who is selfless in serving the people, in social service and in serving the nation.
I would like to tell you about some such people.
Talking about Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did wonderful work to revive the traditional romantic colors of Kutch.
He is doing a great job to take this rare painting to a new generation.
Abdul Gafur gifted the tree of life to former US President Barack Obama.
Sayyid of Marathwad is known as the servant of Mother cow in receiving the Padma awards.
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of mother Gobind is unparalleled.
Listening to Tao Porchon-Lynch of America, you will be surprised to know that Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he is imparting Yoga training to people around the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers.
In Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Turzan, performed the courageous task of confronting the Timber mafia and the Naxalites, not only saved 50 hectares of forests but also motivated ten thousand women to conserve trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to illustrate the work they have done for the upliftment of women with disabilities despite their own disabilities by establishing an institution called Pragyachu Mahila Sevakunj and reviving their vulnerable children to self-reliance.
He set an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable.
Kisan Achievement has inspired 300 women from their area to join the Self Help Groups and make them economically vibrant.
My dear countrymen, I have been experiencing the experience that has touched everyone's heart for the past few days.
Today, whenever I visit the country, I have been trying to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PMJAY or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have availed the benefits of this scheme.
I have seen how a big change is being brought about in the lives of the poor.
If all of you are aware of any poor person who cannot get treatment due to lack of money, tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every such poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for examinations in schools is about to begin.
Separate Boards of Education across the country will commence proceedings for Class 10th and 12th examinations in the next few weeks.
My heartiest congratulations to all the examiners, their wives and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a massive programme of Pariksha Pe Charcha was held in Delhi in the form of a Town Hall.
The special feature of the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme was that there were open-minded discussions on various subjects related to examinations.
There were some aspects that could certainly be beneficial for the students.
All the students, their parents and teachers can watch this entire programme on YouTube and convey my best wishes to all the warriors of the forthcoming exams.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of India and not of festivals.
Perhaps there will be no such day in our country which has no significance at all.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivratri will take place and this time Shivratri is on Mondays and when Shivratri is on Mondays, a special significance of it gets spread in our Manmandir.
My best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had visited Kashi and had the opportunity to spend time with my Divyang brothers and sisters.
So he said, I am mimicrying the Prime Minister.
I was really impressed by the power of the Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, I meet crores of families every month through radio.
Sometimes while talking to you all, reading your letters or listening to the views sent on your phone, I feel that you have accepted me as a part of your family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections are a great commitment to democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with all the electoral races.
And I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, I have received a very sad news.
Shiv Kumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basaveswara has taught us - that is, fulfilling one's responsibilities by working hard, is like the residence of Lord Shiva in Kailasham Dham.
His fame was a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He devoted his entire life to the goal of providing food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
The welfare of the farmers was a priority for Swami ji's life.
Siddhaganga Monastery regularly organised animal and agricultural fairs.
I have had the privilege of receiving the blessings of Param Pujya Swami ji several times.
Kalamsaheb had written a poem for revered Swami ji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life and mission of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful way.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and older than our Republic.
In our country there is no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India who has a registered voter and a registered voter gets an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that polling stations are set up in Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 15,000 feet above sea level, even in the islands of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just for a voter
When we listen to these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
And that is the beauty of our democracy that the entire team of Electoral Commission employees goes to the distant territory to provide an opportunity for a voter to use it.
I compliment the Election Commission for its untiring efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also compliment the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time that the youngsters born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
An opportunity has come for them to take responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be a part of the decision making process in the country.
The time has come for us to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they deserve to vote.
Each one of us must realise that becoming a voter in the country, getting the right to vote is an important milestone in life.
It is my obligation to vote at the same time - this feeling must continue within us.
There should be a lot of pain in life for any reason and if it is not possible to vote.
Whenever something goes wrong somewhere in the country then there should be pain .
I urge the eminent personalities of the country to collectively educate the people about the registration of voters or voting on the day of polls.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will be registered as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some wonderful work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country observed its birth anniversary with a different vision.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes of India's freedom struggle.
You are aware that several rooms and buildings had been closed since independence in the Red Fort.
The rooms of the dam have been converted into a beautiful museum. The museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, dedicated to the Yad-e-Jallian and the 185th Indian Freedom Struggle, has been dedicated to the nation and the entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
The fragrance of our glorious history lies in each brick of these museums.
The corner of the museum inspires us to enter the history of the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
At this venue, British rulers carried out cases against Bharat Mata's brave sons - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was paying obeisance to the memories associated with Netaji at Kranti Mandir in Red Fort, the family members of Netaji presented me a very special cap.
Netaji used to wear these caps.
I have carved the cap in the museum so that people visiting the museum can see it and thereby inspire patriotism.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of their heroes are needed to continue to be carried forward in a different way to the new generation.
Just a few months ago, on December 30, I visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In one of the events, the tricolour was unfurled at the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had unfurled the tricolour five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was thrown at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a similar tradition on 15th August.
This was an occasion to mark the completion of 5 years of the formation of Azad Hind Government.
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled associator.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with the brilliant sons like Dilli Chalo, Tum Muse Khuno, Man Tumhin Azadi Dunga.
For many years it was believed that files related to Netaji should be made public. And I am glad that we could do those things.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we did a lot of things related to Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or the Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always regarded radio as an important medium of connecting with people, as Netaji also had a close relationship with radio and he also chose radio for interacting with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and through radio he interacted with soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj.
I was told that it used to broadcast radio stations, weekly news bulletins that used to live in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, West and Urdu.
The Radio Station will be operated by M.
Vyas ji played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes strengthened our freedom fighters too.
A visual museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir.
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
The Museum has four historical exhibitions and has over 450 paintings and artworks of three centuries old.
The museum showcases excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Selloz Mukherjee.
And I would particularly urge you all to look at the work done by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you must be wondering that things are happening here and I am talking about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has painted on many topics.
He has also drawn pictures of animals and birds, he has drawn pictures of many beautiful landscapes and thereafter he has also worked to bring human characters to the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to most of his work.
He believed that those paintings should be understood by oneself, and the messages given by them in the pictures should be looked at from their own perspective.
Their paintings have been exhibited in European countries, Russia and USA.
I hope that you will definitely visit their pictures in Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our Saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
Saint Ravidas was one such saint.
Ravidas Jayanti on 1st February.
Sant Ravidas ji's Doha is very famous.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every person, it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his message, Saint Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained to the world the true meaning of labour.
He used to say - Man Changa To Kathauti me Ganga means if your mind and heart are sacred then Ishwar resides in your heart.
Saint Ravidas ji's messages have influenced people from all walks of life, from all walks of life, be it the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Chittor or Meerabai, everyone was his followers.
Once again I bow down to Saint Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I will highlight Indias space programme and aspects related to its future.
He also wanted to urge the students to take interest in the space programme and think a little differently from the sky - Kiranji, I appreciate your idea and the message that has been given specially to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the opportunity to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Innumerable young scientists from across the country contribute to our space programme.
We take pride in the fact that today the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching out to the space.
This Kalam-Set has been launched by our students on 24th January.
The sounding rockets built by the students of the University in Odisha have also made several records.
Approximately as many space missions have been started in the last four years since independence since 2014.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
We will soon witness the presence of India on the moon through the Chandrayaan 2 mission.
Our country is using space technology in a better way to protect the lives of people.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, all these things are getting a lot of help from space technology.
Our fishermen brothers have been divided into Navik Devices which are helpful in their security as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
Approximately 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been generated under the scheme 'Housing for Dearness'.
Besides, nearly three and a half crore properties under MGNREGA have also been tagged.
Our satellites are a symbol of the country's growing power today.
It contributes a lot to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative that has gifted development to our neighbouring friendly countries.
Today, India is launching not only the satellites of developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries through our vast competitive launch services.
Sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond those boundaries which were considered impossible so far.
It is a vision to keep watching stars for our children and motivate them to explore newer stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whatever sports person plays, he will blossom and this time many young and young sportspersons have come forward to play in Khelo India.
In the month of January, about 6,000 athletes participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
At the local level, the sportspersons will perform well at the global level.
This time, players from every state have performed well at their respective levels in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is a great inspiration.
Young player Akash Gorkha won a silver medal in boxing and I was reading that the father of the sky Ramesh ji was working as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
So, the Under 21 Womens Kabaddi team of Maharashtra is a resident of Sonali Halvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali's Hoonar.
It is often seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like Kabaddi.
Yet Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed excellently.
Abhinav Shaw of 10 years of Asanasol wins the youngest gold medal in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshaya, a farmer's daughter, won a Gold Medal in Weightlifting at Karnataka.
When we are talking about building India then the resolution of the youth power is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India show that not only the people of big cities have contributed in building a New India but also the youth, youth, sports talent from small towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contests.
But have you heard about the competition to shine toilets
Over 50 lakh toilets have also taken part in a unique tournament that has been going on for nearly a month.
This unique contest is called Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya.
Besides keeping the toilets clean, people are making them beautiful by making some pictures by coloring them and you will also be able to see many pictures of clean and beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I call upon all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in their Panchayat.
Share your clean and beautiful toilet pictures with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
Today, in collaboration with the people of India, India is poised to become Open Defecation Free much before 2nd October 2019, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have also contributed immensely in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And that is why with your colleagues, it is heartening to note that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and the sanitation coverage in rural India has crossed 8 and nearly nine crore families have been provided toilets.
My young friends, the days of examinations will come.
Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, wrote on MyGov that I should talk about the warriors of examinations and examinations.
Shankulji, thank you for taking up these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the period of examination.
From students, their parents to teachers, many people are busy with the work related to examinations.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this topic today in Mann Ki Baat, but you will be happy to know that within two days, I am going to interact with students from all over the country in the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2. 00 am on January 2nd, this time parents and teachers are going to be a part of this programme.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I will have a lot of discussions with my young friends on all aspects related to the exams, particularly on stress-free exams.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas for this. And I am glad that a large number of people are putting their views on MyGov.
I will definitely put some of these ideas and suggestions in front of you during the Town Hall programme.
You must be part of this programme...
You will also be able to see its live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
The entire nation pays homage to the martyrs at 11.
Wherever we may be, we must pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
Remembering revered Bapu and fulfilling the dreams of revered Bapu, building a New India, fulfilling his duties as a citizen, let us move ahead with this resolution.
May this 2019 journey be successfully carried forward.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can bring about a change in our lives and contribute in taking the country and society forward
My best wishes to you all for the year 2019.
You must have wondered how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember 2019 as a country and its capabilities of one hundred and thirty crore people.
It will make us all proud.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
Renowned institutions of the world believe that India is making the country free from poverty at a record pace.
With the determination of the countrymen, sanitation coverage has increased to 5.
For the first time since independence, the Tricolour was on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the world's tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, was received by the country.
The name of the country has been elevated to the world.
The nation was honoured with the UN's highest environmental award Champions of the Earth Award.
Indias efforts in the solar energy and climate change have been ranked globally.
The country's self-defense has got a new strength.
This year our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad. Therefore, we have now become nuclear power in all three water, place and sewage.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
India's first waterway began in Varanasi.
This has ushered in a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The country's longest rail-road bridge, the Bogibeel Bridge, was dedicated to the nation, and the Tso Ma airport of Sikkim - Pakyong was inaugurated.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
Well, if I continue to talk about the men and women of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that this journey of India's progress and prosperity will continue in 2019 and our country will scale new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, we lost some extraordinary countrymen in December this year.
Dr. Jaychandran was known for providing affordable and affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that he was always eager to treat the patient.
He was also paying rent to visit and visit the elderly patients who came to him for treatment.
I'm thebeterindia.
com has read about many such things that inspire society on the website.
Similarly, on 25th December, the death of Sulagitti Narsamma, Karnataka was reported.
Sulagitti Narsamma was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the difficult areas of the state.
Earlier this year, he was honoured with Padmashri.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narsamma who dedicated their lives for the betterment of everyone in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would also like to discuss the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past few days, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors of the city put up camps to provide free treatment to the poor.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from this camp every month.
The zeal of these doctors friends associated with selfless service deserves praise.
Today, I am going to say this thing with great pride that due to collective efforts, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful mission.
Some people told me that a few days ago more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I read about Jaychandran and when I got the opportunity, thebeterindia.
I have been trying to find out such inspirational things by going to com.
I am glad that these days there are many websites that are introducing us with stories that inspire the lives of such strange people.
Like Thepositiveindia.
com is working to create positivity and make society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who will bring about change in the society.
It is easier to spread negativity but in the society many good works are being done around us and these are being done by the collective efforts of all the 130 crore Indians.
Sports is of great importance in every society.
When sports is played, the audience also gets filled with energy.
We have experienced a lot of respect and recognition in the names, recognition of athletes.
But sometimes there are so many things behind it that go beyond sports and are even bigger than sports.
I would like to talk about Hanaya Visar, a daughter of Kashmir, who has won the Golden Championship at the Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and is a resident of Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanaya studied Karate with hard work and perseverance and showed herself a thorough observation.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all fellow citizens.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a 16 year old daughter Raj.
You must have read it too.
Rajni has won a Gold in the Junior Womens Boxing Competition.
Rajini sat on a milk stall and drank a glass of milk on the medal winner.
After that, Rajini put his medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
I was wondering why did Rajni drink a glass of milk
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji. He sells lassi at a stall in Panipat.
Rajni said that his father had made a lot of sacrifice to take him to this place and suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before Rajni and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing to his father, the father encouraged him to get all possible assistance.
Rajini had to undertake a bonding exercise with old socks as the financial condition of his family was not good at that time.
Despite all these obstacles, Raj's courage did not lose and boxing continued to learn.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini.
And I also congratulate Rajini and her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting her and encouraging her.
This month, Pune's 20-year-old daughter, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian to travel to the world.
It used to run around 300 kilometres of cycle daily for 15 days.
Can we not be inspired by knowing about such achievements
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents then we also inspire us to do something in the midst of difficulties.
If resolutions are capable and enthusiastic then obstacles are removed on their own.
Problems can never become obstacles.
If we listen to many such examples then we also get a new inspiration in our lives every moment.
My dear countrymen, there will be many festivals in January with fervor and enthusiasm like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi.
During this time Surya descends and enters Makar Rashi.
After this day, the day begins to grow gradually and the crops of cold begin to bite.
My best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Our festivals have gathered together the fragrance of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
We can see how closely our festivals and festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered different and individuals and communities are the same.
Calendar based on festivals is a good example of our close relationship with nature.
There is also a list of planets and constellations along with festivals.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
The date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon and the sun calendar based on the moon and the moon.
It depends on which calendar they believe.
Festivals are also celebrated in many areas as per the status of planetary constellations.
Gundi Chalo, Chattichand, Ugadi are all celebrated according to the calendar and Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaisakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the Sun calendar.
Our festivals specifically incorporate the feeling of saving rivers and water.
Sixth Festival - Rivers, ponds are connected with sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people immerse themselves in sacred rivers.
Our festivals also give us an understanding of social values.
While on the one hand it has ancient significance, on the other hand every festival teaches the lessons of life - the inspiration to live with each other in a brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to you all for 2019 and wish you all the very best for the upcoming festivals.
Share the pictures taken on these festivals with everyone so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of things in our culture that we can take pride in and we can show the whole world with dignity and one of them is Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
Even in films, a lot must have been seen about its magnificence and its magnificence and its magnificence will be true.
People from the country and around the world come and join the Kumbh.
There is a mass of faith and devotion in the Kumbh Mela.
Millions and millions of people from all over the country and abroad join together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has flourished and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Mela that will be held in Prayagraj on 15th January, all of you might be eagerly waiting for it.
Silsilo has also been started for the Kumbh Congregation from now on.
Its global significance can also be gauged from the fact that last year UNESCO has marked the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago the ambassadors of many countries saw the preparations for the Kumbh and the flags of several countries were hoisted together.
More than 150 people are expected to visit the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
With the divinity of Kumbh, India's magnificence will spread its color throughout the world.
This can be a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for Kumbh were going on with great fervor.
People of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about Kumbh.
I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre there to the nation and the devotees will get a lot of help from it.
This time, a lot of emphasis is also being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If there is cleanliness along with devotion in the event then its good message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotees will be able to pay homage to Akshayvad after a holy dip in the Sangam.
This Akshayvad, a symbol of people's faith, was locked in the fort for hundreds of years, whose devotees could not see it.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for everyone.
I appeal to all of you that whenever you come to Kumbh, keep on putting different facets and pictures on the social media so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
May the Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh also become a Kumbh of nationalism.
May this Kumbh of national unity also become the Mahakumbh of the devotees and also the Mahakumbh of the world tourists.
May this Kumbh of artwork also become Mahakumbh of creative powers.
Worshipping Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa from where Mohan became Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firmly against discrimination.
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, which echoed the world for peace and justice.
2018 is also being celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mandela, also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of a colourful struggle across the world and who was the source of inspiration for Mandela
He had got the courage and inspiration to spend so many years in jail from revered Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only an inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals also inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a DGP Conference at Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the world's highest statue is Statue of Unity and there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
There was a detailed discussion on how to take steps to further strengthen the security of the country and its citizens.
During this period, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Integration which will be given to those who have contributed in any form to national integration.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that Indias strength lies in its diversity.
Respecting the spirit of Sardar Patel, we pay our homage to Sardar Patel through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is a sacred occasion to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his work was in north India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi in Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and Nanded in the last moment of life.
In a way, the entire India received his blessings.
Her life span gives a glimpse of the whole of India.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji won the position of Guru at a young age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus in Warsaw.
He was a calm and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore henceforth says: I would like to say - I would like to say - I would like to talk to one-and-a-half-million-fighting, Chiddio-one-Baj-Tuduntabe Govind Singh
He said that strength cannot be exhibited by fighting the weaker sections.
Shri Govind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice, charity, who had a supernatural knowledge of both arms and sciences.
He was not only an archer but also a scholar of many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again, I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
It means Food Safety and Standard Authoriti is being done by India.
Several programmes are being organized across the country to commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
Under the Eat Right India Campaign, healthy India tours are coming out across the country.
The expedition will continue till 2nd January.
India will also prosper when India will be clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is most important for good health.
You should also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Education of food is essential from childhood only.
My dear countrymen, this is the last edition of 2018.
We will meet again in 2019, we will talk about our minds again, be it the life of an individual, life of a nation, life of a society, inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let us move ahead, let us move ahead, let us change ourselves, change our country too. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On October 3, 2014, the holy festival of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started a journey together.
Today 50 episodes of this journey of Mann Ki Baat have been completed.
Similarly, today is the Golden Jubilee Episod Golden Jubilee Episod.
The letters and phones that you have received this time are mostly related to this 50th episode.
Similarly, on the Narendra Modi App, Monica Jain, Bardwan, the President of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur, all of them have asked a similar question.
He says that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile apps, but why did you like radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that when the radio was forgotten in today's era, why did Modi come with radio
I was 9 months old and I was going to some other place in the evening.
When it gets cold in the evening in the mountains of Himachal then stop at a dhaba for tea and when I order tea then before that he was very small, he used to make tea and sell it.
There was no upper clothing.
On the shore of the same radical standing with a small larvae .
He said, No, Saheb, dont you know what is a matter of great happiness.
He said, See, Saheb listened to the radio and the discussion was going on on on the radio.
Access to communication and its depth, perhaps no one can do the same to the radio.
This thing has been home in my mind since that time and I was only guessing its strength.
So when I became the Prime Minister, it was natural for me to draw attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I assumed office as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I had the desire that the unity of the country, our glorious history, its valour, India's diversity, the sermons of our society, the people's fortitude, sacrifice, penance, all these things should reach out to the people.
From remote villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals...
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these aspects which are very interesting.
Of the people surveyed, on an average, 70 of them are people who listen to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is to increase the spirit of positivity in society.
Jan Andolans have been given a big boost through Mann Ki Baat.
There has also been a wide range of discussions on Indiapositivity.
It is also a testimony to the positive spirit of our countrymen.
People have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has increased the spirit of volunteerism.
Besides radio, mobile, internet, Facebook lives and periscopes, Narendra Modi App is also connecting with Mann Ki Baat.
I sincerely thank all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for expressing their faith and becoming a part of it.
Your ambition is true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and listens to millions of crores, then what would he want
Some young friends studied all the subjects related to Mann Ki Baat. They analyzed the words of all episodes, lexical analysis, and studied what words were spoken several times.
Which words were repeated.
One of them is that this programme has been indescribable.
When Mann Ki Baat was started then I had decided that there should be no politics, no government should be praised in it, no Modi should be there in it and the biggest strength to fulfill this resolution of mine should be the biggest inspiration amongst you.
Modi will come and go but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
It will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
Whenever a government has so much strength that the movement of selfiewithdaughter starts from a small village in Haryana and spreads to not only the entire country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, celebrities and all should be united and in a new, modern language of thinking in the society, which is understood by today's generation.
Sometimes the fun of Mann Ki Baat also goes on but I always have 130 crore Indians.
His mind is mine.
Mann Ki Baat is not a Government matter. This is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
Indias original life is not politics but Indias original life is not royal power.
Indias roots are socio-economic and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life and one of them is politics as well.
Politics is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes political events and politics get so defeated that other talents of the society and other men get pressed.
It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the talent of the common man gets an appropriate place for a bright future like India. Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction.
Your question is in a way intimately asked.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking questions to the Prime Minister, you know that you are asking questions to a close friend of yours.
If I answer the questions you have asked, I will say nothing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Every time letters from people come before Mann Ki Baat.
On MyGov and NarendraModi Mobile App, people share their thoughts and thoughts, there is also a toll free number - 1800 11800.
People also record their messages in their voices by calling there.
When the episode of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read the ideas and information sent by you during the journey very closely.
And that is why when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I take note of some facts like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
As a matter of fact, there is a voice in Mann Ki Baat but the examples, emotions and emotions belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whose names I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat till date but they keep sending their letters and comments without being disheartened - your thoughts and your feelings matter a lot in my life.
I am confident that I will meet many times more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more comfortable, more effective and useful.
It is also tried that letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat should also be addressed by the concerned departments on letters and suggestions.
With his hard work Mann Ki Baat is reaching out to more and more people.
Akashvani team prepares every episode for broadcast in many languages.
Some people efficiently address Modi in regional languages and in the same tonne Mann Ki Baat.
Thus, it becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I would urge you all to listen to this programme in your local languages as well.
I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to my friends in the media who regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Any political media is never happy with it, it feels that it gets very little coverage or the coverage that is negative but the media has created a lot of topics in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, Selfie with Doctor etc. There are several topics that the media has worked to take forward innovatively in the form of a campaign.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat will remain incomplete.
In fact, I don't have any secret.
Whatever I am doing will be done in all the families as well.
In simple language, I try to imbibe myself and the youth. I try to create a harmony and a wealth with the ideas of keeping myself in that condition.
It becomes easier for anyone to understand when we dont come in the middle of our life.
Today's youth is capable of not doing anything they don't believe in themselves. And when they believe in something, they leave everything behind it.
Sometimes people talk of a communication gap between elderly people and young people in their families.
In fact, most of the households have a very limited scope to interact with the youth.
In most of the times, there is an obstacle in teachings or in habits or in lifestyles - we should not do such taxes. There is an uncompromising lack of mindset and gradually there is a lot of reduction in the number of families and that is also a matter of concern.
Discussing instead of expressing expressions and dismisses will make communication effective.
My endeavour is to continuously interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or are thinking.
They always have the store of Idea.
They are highly energetic, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts of the youth more and more with them.
Many times there are complaints that the youngsters ask a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that a new one asks questions.
This good thing is because it means that they want to examine everything from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth, but I believe that youth dont have time to wed them, this is the thing that helps them become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that todays youth is very ambitious and thinks of a lot of big things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieving big achievements.
Finally, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I tell you, what is wrong with it
He is proficient in multitasking and hence he does so.
If we look around, be it social enterprises or start-ups or be it sports or be it any other sector or be it the youth who bring about a big change in the society.
Those youngsters who had the courage to ask questions and dream big.
If we bring down the ideas of the youth to the ground and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinitaji has written to Mygov that in Mann Ki Baat, I should talk about the Constitution Day coming tomorrow i. e.
He says that this day is special because we will enter the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vinita ji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
It is a day to recall those great personalities who made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1947.
It took two years and eleven months and seventeen days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this historic task of framing the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great personalities gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace at which he built the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It also inspires us to complete our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of great talents of the country. Each one of them was committed to give a Constitution that empowers the people of India and empowers the poorest of the poor.
The special feature of our Constitution is that rights and duties i. e.
The synergy between these two peoples will take the country forward.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will be protected automatically. And thus, if we follow our duties assigned to the Constitution, we will be able to protect our rights.
I still remember that in 2010, when the Republic of India had completed 60 years, in Gujarat, we had removed the spectacle of the Constitution by placing it on the elephant.
It was a memorable occasion to raise awareness about the Constitution among the youth and to connect them with the Constitutional aspects.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years and in 2022 we will complete 75 years of our independence.
Let us all take forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of those great men can never be forgotten who were at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
6th December is their Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Babasaheb who has empowered crores of Indians to live with dignity.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say - Indias democratic values have not come from outside.
What is a democracy and what is a parliamentary system has never been a new thing for India.
At the Constituent Assembly, he made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect our freedom from such a struggle to the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be from different backgrounds, but we have to keep national interest on all things.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on November 23, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and in the coming year i. e.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He showed the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to society.
Similarly, a train will run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I was reminded of writer Sahib Gurudwara at that time.
The Gurudwara was severely damaged during the 2001 earthquake of Gujarat, but the way the state government renamed it together with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to construct Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit Pakistan and Kartarpur at that sacred place of Guru Nanak Devji.
My dear countrymen, we will meet once again after 50 episodes, in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I got the opportunity to place the feelings behind this programme of Mann Ki Baat for the first time because you asked such questions but our journey will continue.
The more you associate yourselves, the more our journey will be deeper and satisfying to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today I would like to say that one thing is touched by the reflection of Mann Ki Baat. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat by sitting with all the family members then it seems that the elders of our family are sitting amongst us and sharing their own things with us.
When I heard this at length, I was very satisfied that I am amongst you. And in a way I will also be visiting you as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat.
Your aspirations, my ambitions.
Let us take this journey further.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months prior to independence, on 2nd January 14, the world famous International Magazine, published the edition Time Magazine, had a portrait of Sardar Patel.
He had published a map of India in his main story and there was no such map that we saw today.
It was a map of India divided in many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that India was endangered by division, violence, food crisis, inflation and state politics.
Time Magazine further writes that if anyone has the ability to serve the country in the formula of unity and to fill the grievances then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
How he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha
His integrity and commitment to the country was such that the farmers, labourers and businessmen used to trust him.
Whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajwada of Rajasthan, Sardar Patel, today we can see an Indian with their sensitivity and strategic skills.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel after seeing this nation bound by unity and mother India.
On 31st October, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation, paying our homage to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of Narmada river in Gujarat, the statue is double the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
It is the worlds tallest statue of skyscrapers.
Every Indian can now take pride in the fact that the world's highest statue is on the soil of India.
The land that Sardar Patel was attached to will now enhance the splendor of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their bravery. But do you know why we all Indian citizens consider it an infantry day
This is the day when the Indian Army descended on the soil of Kashmir and protected the valley from insurgents.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview of Sammanakshaw, who was a great military officer of India.
Field Marshal Manekshaw was recalling the time when he was a colonel.
During this period, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir in October 14.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had become the leader for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir during a meeting, Sardar Patel looked at him in his specific budget during the meeting and said that there should not be any delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and the solution should be resolved as soon as possible.
After that, the army personnel flew into the Kashmir-Bhani aircraft and we saw how the army was successful.
31 October is also the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhiji.
Indira ji also paid her respects.
My dear countrymen, no one likes sports.
My two memorable visits have taken place recently.
Earlier, I had the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes at the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
In this game, India won a total of 2 medals and won a new record and made India proud.
I had the privilege of personally meeting all these talents with Para Athletes and congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina had the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have done the best ever performance in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also won 13 medals and 3 second medals in mix events.
You might remember that this time Indias performance in Asian Games was also excellent.
See, in the last few minutes, how often I have used the best words, the most glorious words ever so far.
This is the story of todays Indian sports which touches new heights on a day.
India is making new records not only in sports but also in those fields.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won Gold in Athletics for the country in the 2018 Asian Para Games.
She is a Divyang since birth.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a waiter in Dhaba for cleaning the DTC buses to drive life.
Today, Narayana is winning the Gold in International events for India.
Not only this, India has never won a senior level or Junior level medal in Judeo.
But Tababi made history by winning a silver medal in Judo at Youth Olympics.
The 16 year old player Tababi Devi is a resident of a village in Manipur.
His father is a labourer while his mother works as a fisherman.
Many times, there was a time when his family did not even have food.
Even in such circumstances, the courage of Tababi Devi is not rigid.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are countless stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson has the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that we had successfully organized the Fifa Under-1 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
There was also a new record of the number of visitors at the Fifa Under-1 World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and enhanced the courage of the young athletes.
This year, India has had the privilege of organizing the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian wants to have a hockey attachment in his mind be it any sports activity or any sports activity.
India has had a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in many events and has also been the winner of the World Cup.
India has also given many great sportspersons to Hockey.
Whenever there will be talk of Hockey in the world, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world is familiar with Major Dhyanchand of Hockey.
Thereafter, from Balwinder Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai, a huge tower has been cut.
Even today, Team India sportspersons are inspiring new generation of Hockey with their hard work and hard work.
It is a good opportunity for sports lovers to watch thrilling matches.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only boost the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Mens Hockey Team and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians stand by them and support them and convey my best wishes to all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming volunteers for this thing, it is inspiring and encouraging for all the countrymen.
But in the new age, in the new generation, with new zeal, enthusiasm and new dreams, today we are coming forward to do these things.
Every Indian will be proud of the enthusiasm and commitment he has for this work.
It is aromatic for the journey from IT to Society, Main Nahin Hum, Ahm Nahin Vayam, Self to Samshti.
Someone is educating children and somebody is educating the elderly.
If someone is engaged in cleanliness then someone is helping the farmers and there is no curiosity behind doing all that, but it has a sense of selflessness of dedication and determination.
A young man learnt his own wheelchair basketball to help the basketball team of the Divyangs.
This is the dedication, this is a mission mode.
Won't any Indian be proud of this thing
This spirit of Main Nahin Hum will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was seeing your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat, I saw a wonderful surprise from Puducherry to Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He has written on MyGov - Please talk about how the customs and traditions of the tribes of India are the best examples of coexistence with nature.
There is a need to learn from how we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I compliment you for keeping this topic among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is an issue that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture and today the whole world, especially the Western countries, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for sustainable lifestyle- balanced lifestyle.
Though our India is not free from this problem, but we just have to do our best, we have to do our best, we have to see our rich history and traditions, and we have to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities especially.
Staying in harmony with nature has been a part of the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of central India, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Pippalo and Arjuna.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Bishnoi society has shown us the path of conservation.
Particularly in the context of tree conservation, it is acceptable to sacrifice their lives, but they do not approve of loss of a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal Pradesh claims to have a relationship with tigers.
They consider them to be their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, tigers are seen as forest protectors.
The people of Varali community in Maharashtra consider Tiger as guests and for them the presence of tigers is going to bring prosperity.
There is a belief among the coal community in central India that their own destiny is linked to tiger and if the tiger does not get food then the village will also have to remain hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the Kethan river during the rainy season.
They consider these areas as fish shelters because of which they get healthy and abundant fish.
Adivasi community makes their homes by natural content, it is not only strong but also environment friendly.
In the solitary regions of the Nilgiri Plateau of South India, a small familiar community, traditionally their settlements are made up of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a fact that the tribal community believes in living in a very peaceful and interactive manner. But when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that the tribal communities were among our freedom fighters.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who struggled hard against British rule to protect his forest land
There are many examples of tribal communities that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and today the wealth of forests that we have saved is the source of our tribal people.
Let us express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about individuals and institutions who are doing extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which appear to be ordinary at first glance but in fact they have a deep impact on changing the mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the farmer brother of Punjab, Gurubachan Singh ji.
A common and hardworking farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh ji's daughter.
Before this marriage Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry simplicity.
There is no need to spend any expense be it the people or be it other things.
You might be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, whatever he had said in his words, this is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you promise me that you will not burn in the fields anymore.
You can imagine how big social power is there in this thing.
Gurubachan Singh ji is very respectful but he shows how vast his personality is and we have seen that there are so many families in our society who transform the individual event into an event of social interest.
The family of Shriman Gurbachan Singh has set a similar example before us.
I have read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are taking forward the Indian heritage of healthy lifestyle as a true heir.
Just as Tiptype lakes are built, small awareness and activeness and positive work always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, in our texts it is said: - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .
Peace be established everywhere in life, in heart, in me, in stars, in every particle of the world.
This year 11th November is a special significance for India as the World War I ended 100 years ago on 11th November, that is, the centenary of the catastrophic destruction and the end of the catastrophe.
The First World War was an important event for India.
In the true sense, we had nothing to do with that war directly.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made a supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anybody.
Our soldiers have demonstrated their valour in difficult areas and in extreme conditions.
The only objective behind all of them was the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world witnessed the sound of destruction.
According to estimates, nearly one crore soldiers and almost all the citizens lost their lives.
It understood the importance of peace all over the world.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean just war.
From terrorism to environmental change, from economic development to social justice, there is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
Development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, there is something about our Ishaan Bharat.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unparalleled and the people there are very talented.
Our glorious India is now known for its best practices.
Ishaan Bharat is a region that has made great strides in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that this award for best policy decision-making in this field is like Oscar in that field.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by leaving behind the 51 nomination policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on these festivals.
I would urge you all to take care of yourself in these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival will also become an opportunity for you people to move forward in the form of a mission and take a firm resolve.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more you progress the country will progress.
My best wishes to you all.
