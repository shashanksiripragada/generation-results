There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not just commendable that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given revolutionary movements and thereby a new evolution and a clear ideology to Indian politics.
We can still see a concept among the people that the revolutionaries are merely fools and that they have not cared about human lives.
The period of Bhagwad Singh reminds us of their humanity, clear thought and ability.
It was only after the assembly bombing programme of April 1929 that the name Bhagwad Singh became popular in India.
He made his debut in Tamilnadu in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to all the corners of Tamilnadu.
The most surprising news in history is that the name of any leader born in north India, including Gandhian, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.
That's because the father is Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in the Republican Week entitled Bagthsing.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and presented some comments on the political situation of the day.
Sections from the headquarter: -
'We say,' he said, 'If Bhagthsingh really made sure that he was all right with his principles and that his models were the right way to do it and if he had decided that he would have acted as he did, and that if he didn't, he wouldn't have been a good man.
Let us now call him a true man.
It is our strong opinion that Bhagth Singh's policy is really necessary for India.
If Mr. Bhagth Singh was hanged and did not turn his life alive, this success would not have been the source of such popularity.
And we would have said that if Bhagwad Singh had not been executed, Gandhiji would have been made even more.
Why did Bhagwad Singh, who had to be silky and ashes with a sickness of his own, give the people of India the right mother to show the right path to real equality and peace to the people of the world
Ordinarily we appreciate Bhagat Singh as a mango, vayara and handloom by saying that no one else can achieve it."
In an editorial in the Republican journal, Father Periyar said.

I was shocked to say that he was arrested for this and that it was difficult for any 6-year-old child to understand and explain.

On the ground, Vikramlander has been hit hard and NASA has released the photo proof.
The LROC architect of NASA has captured and dispatched a strong landing space in the southern pole of Land, Vikram Lander, 28 Chandrayaan-2.
ISROs Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft satellite, Vikram Lander, landed in the southern pole of the Earth on 07th August 2019.
But at the last minute, the communication was cut off.
On the ground, Vikram Lander was supposed to have been damaged and cut off as the lander collided with speed rather than landing.
The LROC reporter of NASA crossed the South Pole of the Land on 17th.
Vikram Lane Dur landed at Simpbe Lieus N and Mancinas C in a very modern way.
After examining these films, Vikram Lander is sure to land on the ground.
And that is why it has fallen to some distance from the ground floor.
John Keller, deputy director of NASA's AROC program said, "The LROC arbitrator passed over the southern pole of the state on 17th.
At that time, the films were shot in the darkness of the evening.
As a result, Vikram Lander appeared to have hit the ground strongly.
Vikram Lander, however, could not find an accurate landing site.
The LROC R Pitter will re-cross South Pole on 14th of next month.
Since the light will be good at that time, there is a lot of scope for Vikram Lander to capture the film," he said.

It is a matter of concern that a large number of people are being detained in the valley of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Government of India should initiate political activities in the state.
The elections must be held at the earliest as promised earlier.
Relaxation of restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir and release of detainees.
Olis Wells urged the Government of India to take steps for this purpose at a fast pace.
Earlier, it was reported that the US wanted President Donald Trump to mediate on Jammu and Kashmir.
This was strongly opposed by the Indian side.

It has been decided in the meeting of the IID Council that the fees for all Indian Institutes of Technology will be increased by 10 times.
The Institute of Technical Education (IITs) is playing a crucial role in building skilled students across India.
The IIC Council Meeting was held on 28. 09. 2019 under the Chairmanship of the Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal, along with Directors of 23 ITIs under the Department of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
The decision taken at the meeting is shocking to the students and the public.
Decision has been taken to increase the MTech and tuition fees by 10 times in IITs.
In all the IITs in India, only Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 is being charged for semesters.
Now that fee has been increased to Rs 2 lakh per annum.
A total of 9,280 students are eligible for scholarships from 12 AYUSH students in the academic year 2019-20, with an outlay of Rs 12,400 per month for MTech and students.
The Government of India is going to reduce the funds provided to IITs like Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karakpur, Kanpur, Rurgi and Guwahati.
The Government of India has increased the fees for collection of funds from students to deal with such reductions.
Further, the Ministry has been advised to undertake development works, borrowings and obtaining funds from the Corporate Institutions, keeping in view the availability of construction works by the respective Technical Institutions.
Since the BJP came to power, it has been preventing the access to education to the common man as much as possible, reducing the funds for primary education in the budget in 2015, followed by a fiscal statement that has drastically reduced the funds for education.
This was followed by a continuation of the opening up of academic institutions by big business to facilitate private educational institutions.
In this context, the new academic policy has enforced a variety of norms for academic institutions to fund private institutions without giving any significance to government educational institutions.
Thus, the central government has pushed Indias prosperous future back into an uneducated nation after centuries by placing it on the path of accessible people from basic education to higher education.

I hear how many detentions have you imposed in Cauvery in the last eight years under the ADMK regime
Another question is, during the DMK regime, we have constructed more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.
Can you point out that there is only one dam constructed under the ADMK regime so far
Don't lie.
In response to their allegations, the opposition leader explained with evidence that we are either building a detention or planning to build in these places.

Does the BJP handle the legendary caste politics in Tamilnadu
In Tamilnadu, however, it is said that if it is not possible to clean up Thamar, it will finally take the politics of caste into the hands of the BJP.
For the first time when Modi was the Prime Minister, he was in a position to see Thamar abandoned.
After this, Amitsha denounced her for the second time, i.e., during the Empire elections, 'You don't know what to do.'
But only the soil was finished in the 5 contesting seats.
Though the BJP is shining all over the country, there is a wave of protest in Tamil Nadu.
Above all, Triple Talaq, Kashmir, Hindi imposition, One Nation is the same language.
Because of all this, it is still dry.
That's why the BJP leadership is supposed to be in a slurry over the BJP executives in Tamilnadu, which has led to unable to appoint even the state chief.
Though this is on the one hand, the BJP plans to root out BJP in Tamilnadu in the coming assembly elections.
It is learnt that the BJP leadership has come to an end through direct field reports and intelligence reports.
Accordingly, the idea of two Dravidian parties that do not give sufficient importance to the people of Nadar, Vanniyar and the Vanniyar community and the people of Devendra kala, whether it is the DMK or the DMK, is prevalent among the people.
It is also reported that Dravidian parties are in distress.
The BJP has started hand-in-hand with this spectacle.
It has decided to honour and honour each and every community with a position to pride or give importance.
The appointment of Soundrarajan as the Governor of Telangana is also the same.
Similarly, the BJP government is reportedly giving importance to top-ranking countries in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP works to honour every race, it will bring pride and happiness to its people.
Moreover, one thing that cannot be forgotten in any matter will make the BJP mad at this caste politics.
At the same time, while Tamilnadu is already shrinking in caste politics, it is not known whether the BJP's actions will be like pouring more oil into the burning fire.
It is true that if the caste fire starts to burn and even the skin of Thamarai, which is now blossoming in Tamilnadu, will pierce on the same fire.
