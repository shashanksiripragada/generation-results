During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers showed the fact that the state government does not have the right to acquire their land by offering cane.
The Chief Justice, while taking a dig at the Central Government, gave an ultimatum that if the Central Government does not respond to land acquisition on the 26th of this year, the Court will order the final.

A wonderful desk: This story belongs to a person from Turkey who has made a big discovery by repairing the house.
When the wall of its basement broke down while renovating it, it stuck with a secret door.
From here, he reached an underground tunnel where he met the thousands of years old city hiding inside the ground.
The pictures of this city show how around 20,000 people lived in this underground city along with arrangements for all their luggage and food items.
600 gates to be admitted to the city:
The incident is in 1963, when a Turkish citizen living in Capadosia discovered the underground city.
While repairing the house, the walls of its basement were broken.
From here, an underground city named Darinyuku, located at a depth of 280 feet inside the ground, was found.
Its depth was 18 storage buildings.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, including rooms, coaches, schools, churches, tombs, etc.
There are 600 doors to enter and exit this city.
There are heavy gates, which are meant to prevent fugitives in the underground city.
Every flower of this can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built between 80 and 1180 BC in the secondary period so that people can be safeguarded in the war and natural calamities between Arab and Bathinin.
Constructed Turist Attraction:
