Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling to improve the highway system while demolishing, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which is fitted with cleaning on your car's dashboard. goes.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and circulates that information to the authorities, has now become a controversial issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the old system for financing major US roads.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of sudden debate and vibrant alliances.
The miles you drive, and the possibly driven locations you drive - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - have joined the Liberian environmental groups to mobilize support in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is confused.
The American Civil Freedom Union is also very worried raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are searching for how they can go to a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor-drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is actually an essential item for our country.
"It is not a matter of choice or not chosen by us, it is to say that Hassan Ikharata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, is planning to start tracking every mile set by motor-drivers in California by 2025. is.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost become bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by American citizens.
American people no longer buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more miles in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in the Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high value of gas, politicians refrain from increasing one penny in tax.
Lee Munikh, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, "Gas is not sustainable at all.
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option."
Vonx is called a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good for urban liberals because it can change taxes for example to change the way cars are driven, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are eager for this system, while they are developing strategies to fulfill the goals set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, RP Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers the Black Box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favor of paying per mile by the driver.
In the region, the policy vice president, Adrian Moore said, "This is not just a tax which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are receiving.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011, graceed the Congress to move forward towards payment per mile.
US Senate had sanctioned a 90-million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of the rural law makers, who were representing individuals who had to walk a lot of miles to go to work daily or go to the city, the leadership of the House ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving forward in this direction themselves.
It has the most interested Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fee instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor their every step.
Alauddin Khan, who guides strategic and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and similar things was a major problem.
This is not something that people wanted.
As the test progressed, ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which must be spread to keep every person's daily commuting record.
Nevada is one of the many states which is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles the car is running, but not where and at what time it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, then people can feel more comfortable.
The quest for this technology brought some state agencies to True Miles, a small California Start-up.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device that it is testing is good for highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at fixed time intervals.
Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage, said, "If you do not track people's speed and their place, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these preliminary programs of the state.
There are very less expensive and less interfering methods to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options for drivers.
They can select GPS or GPS devices.
Or you can not choose any device, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places are hopeful that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than less in the device.
In New York city, the transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device, which will also facilitate the payment of parking meter fees, "Payment Insurance will be provided according to their drive, and will collect real time data from other drivers The motor-driver will be able to use it to avoid traffic. "
It has been mentioned in the city planning document, "The motor-driver will be attracted to the participation due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payment according to miles is a big deal.
In the San Francisco Gulf region, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be charged extra time or annual charges, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their proper share.
Randy Rentseller, director of the commission's legislation and public affairs, said, "When Aspirin can work, then what is the need for radical surgery for it"
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death is due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the goods of the deceased.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Daria.

The woman told in the inquiry that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhail went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the stuff on the edge, while Ruhail went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched for ahid, but he could not find it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, clock and other accessories and kept it for his use.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Sylvio Berlusconi, known for the Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This is disclosed by his family friend Marthal Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, has married former TV anchor Franciska Pascal in his personal chapel.
Francisca's Balusconi met when he was a teenage activist in the Forza Italian party.

No one can tell anything other than this.
Although she did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
Both of them married on October 8 or 9, about three weeks ago.
About 8 months ago, a 28-year-old woman, 50 years younger than her, was engaged to Francisca Pascal.
To avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi formed the basis of loneliness behind this decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued to intermittent between the sun's eyes and micholi.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, below minus -0.2 degrees in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, due to rain and snow, strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed for traffic.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, was once again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as children's blood drinking dracula, but the court rejected his demand to ban media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam, refusing to order the media to stop the news about Asaram, said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not influenced by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter and said that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has turned down Asaram's demand to ban media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group director of the mall cut the TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the public exchequer.
By doing so, the rupee of TDS has been deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai took action in collaboration with the Jaipur Exploration Team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that the trader has cut TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was about 15 days ago, raids and surveys were conducted on the group of this mall operator.
Angered by this action, the trader has clearly told the officials of the Income Tax Department that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupees to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action.
Officials investigating in this case have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
Given Deepawali, demand for sweets increases.
Given this, the sale of poor and fake mave increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70 thousand spoons from Mawa and uetta Colony from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand spoons.
With the demand for sweets in the market increased, the demand for poor mave from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The Department received information about the poor mave kept in dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Nagpur is being floated from the transport garage.
The department took possession of this mave, which was priced at Rs 70 thousand.
Fear of action has not given any right to Mave.
The department destroyed it by treating it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
A chemical called sodium hydrosphate was used to shine and stay for more days.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
SS Deshmukh, co-compromising commissioner of the department said that the campaign for chemical sweets and poor and fake mave will continue.
In the next few days, the information has been given by the department to speed up this campaign.
Consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from the mave.
The appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the department to be cautious of fake sweets and mave.
Selected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received them strongly at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for the consolation tour organized by the BJP.
The consolation journey is organized by the BJP to heal the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the hunker rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were seven blasts one after the other.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were casualties and there was panic in the state.
That intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have gone on a trip from Thursday after taking bones from their village.
On November 5, all of them will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
The consolation journey is organized as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will meet their families by visiting the villages of those killed in the blasts from seven o'clock on Saturday morning.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five-five rupees to the relatives of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the blazing victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
In order to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs due to the rains, India had to win the Nagpur ODIs in any situation and its batsmen performed a bang and won the record, so that the team equals with 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved twice the target of more than 350 runs and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got a salute pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar, which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a great partnership in the opening.
Kohli, who has performed at number three, is being considered as Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have given them better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 next week, has taken 17 ODIs, out of which India has won 16.
Following the target, their average is above 80. 00 and they have emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in a strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open accounts in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings can work as a 'lifeline' in Bangalore ODIs.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have influenced everyone with their performance.
They are also demanding to be taken in the Test team for the domestic Assessment Series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to the ninth number.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Wogs and James Falkner have done a good batting in the series.
However, Fil Hunge and Aeron Finch have not left any effect in the opening.
Lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be heavy to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed well in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashes series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this showy peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists near 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even more frustrated.
Referring to the Pakistani visit of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lieutenant General aheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given air in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks in the killing of soldiers on the border, Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolishing the privileges of the army in such a situation as fatal, the BJP leader said that doing such things till permanent peace in the state is also anti-people.
They encourage anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders of the army, the morale of the security forces should be banned.
Snow Dayn ready to "cooperate" with Germany on American surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, American intelligence informer, has declared that German is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fail to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Bayley met Mr Snow Dean Seguru in Russia, where he has been sheltered to talk about the testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dane before the media in Berlin on Friday, "Although the consequences of my efforts are certified positive, my government believes disagreement as a party change, and does not provide any defense which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of felony.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include intelligence and theft from the government's property.
Hans Peter Fredrick, Minister of German Interior Affairs, told Online Leit: "If Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, we have to find ways to make it possible.
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure because the NSA has bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Operman, MP, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence. Said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snow Dane as a witness, "Without completely ruining relations with the United States and bringing them in danger, it should also be taken."
Mr. Straw Beley, a Green Party MP from Germany, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their journey to Russia.
Mr. Straw Belene said, according to former NSA contractor lawyer, Snow Den is not able to return to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snow Dane testifies in Germany, he will be  safe there which assurances will be required, the MP said.
Mr. Snow Dane said in his letter that he had to face a fearful and continuous campaign, for that he had to leave home.
Although he said that the world was happy and overwhelmed by widespread reactions towards his work of political expression.
World citizens as well as high officials, including the United States, have underestimated the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to collaborate with the German authorities , when the problems of the human situation have been resolved .
Crontier Airlines to charge carry - on baggage
Crontier Airlines plans to charge  100 for carrying on store goods for passengers on your plane board.
Crontier Airlines plans to start a charge for F100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it announced that passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carriage - on duty is for the bag in the overhead bin, so, the small bag below the seat will still be charged free.
Drontier said that  25 will charge if advance is paid, 100 will wait if passengers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Drontier spokesman Kate O'Malie said that  100 fees are to be obtained to take care of the passengers in advance.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second test bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger charges are paying as much as they can in the carriage on baggage which is stashed in the overhead compartment means that there is often less space in this compartment .
There's a way to bring less for travelers on the fee board.
O'Mally said it's not really about collecting new charge money.
It's about the most loyal customers to find that overhead bin's place has become very difficult to find.
Passengers who buy tickets in the airline's own website do not have to pay this.
That means that the next person in line might have to pay 100 for the same bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate, can get a bag free of charge.
O'Malie said that the procedures of the rontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that passengers know about fees before getting to the gate.
Crontier's new carrier - on fees will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but the airline likes them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of deficit.
Most of them, although they didn't touch the Carry-on-bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the Carry-on charges for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, the other airline is Hungary's Fi Air, which airline adviser J. Sorensen said, and who tracks the add-on-fee.
He said that Spirit's carriage - on duty brings 50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official recently flew to Spirit and expressed surprise at the passengers who had to face carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process I saw in my airline career was comfortable, he said.
I hoped to grind my teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and he offered it lickety-split."
Drontier is also following 2 fees of Spirit for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Drontier said that the passenger who takes the soda, or the juice can keep the whole box, and give it free coffee only once.
It'll still give away the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge beverages in 2008, but after seven months after the passengers complained, they retreated and followed any other main airline after being there.
If the passengers of the rowtier's do not buy directly from the airline, then this move of the rotier to charge the duty on the carrier is its latest effort to operate customers towards its own website.
Airlines pays to the online travel seller, rbit for each such 10 to 25 tickets sold.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Drontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
Several flights in September started giving half of the distance to the customers who bought from these persons from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles rotier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It's also that they allow the only passengers to choose their seats in advance when they buy directly from the rontier website.
Drontier's Denver has a loyal base of customers in his hometown, but its business is declining and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Trying to fix the financing of Crontier as part of the sales of Republic Airlines.
NSA accuses "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortcomings our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in the statement sent by the email, "NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight, which was due to internal error during pre-determined updates."
This problem will be solved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible for some users.
NSA spokesman told ABC News that "the agreement was not reached" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectic group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by attacking DDOS.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity, unless the site is closed due to overloading of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively unregulated and the aim of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, which was once named "no such agency", has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism amongst the common people in the recent months when events of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programmes have emerged - after stealing and revelation of the secret NSA files from the agency by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to the growing controversy over the agency, it was speculated after tonight incident that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the theme 'One and Dronacharya' showing reconciliation in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru hostage is forced to walk on the wrong path.
The play was inaugurated jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of the Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The play depicts the equilibrium of the circumstances of Dronacharya of Dwapar era and presently a professor Arvind.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod restless, Hemant Goyal, Border Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammi, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a grand presentation while doing full justice with the characters.
In the play, lighting was done by young colorman Jitendra C. Raj and set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, a variety of awards were given to Apta for his literary and cultural contributions.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorman Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the success of the event.
Declining profits of Bombardier as delivery of aircraft, declining orders
Canadian airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and on contract issues, less than that in air order and pressure by delivery.
Montreal-based Bombardier did not even present an update on issues that would release any flight test data for its brand new Series aircraft or complete its ambitious program to go to commercial service from next September.
Almost half a month before the first flight of the test plane, it's just three times, the question is whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the share has been sent for sliding more than 8 percent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst share with the National Bank Financial, reduced its rating to "regional performance from votes" on Thursday, the stock is limited over the next one or two quarters.
"The weaker aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with margin performance in transport," Doorsen said in a client note.
We'll get new orders for the Bombardier Services as the progress of the flight testing program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, suspect that the market program will be embarrassed.
Bombardier hopes the airlines can now cut it at the bottom of the Boeing and Airbus dominated market.

New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But as soon as the evening, our mind changes and we start walking against the rule of keeping the ideal on one side.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Axles School of Business of YouTO.
According to researchers, in the morning there is no tension of work, we prefer moral values, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
Researchers did two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right side.
The participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately misrepresented their principles.
With this, researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Cocaine's acquaintance counsel imprisoned to Mr. Big in connection with police investigation
42-year-old Basharat Ditta informs the infamous criminal Neil Scarboro
The advocate felt that people might know about his confidential drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in jail by the Liverpool Crown Court
The top defendant's lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he feared that his drug addiction would be known to the people, he was imprisoned for three years.
After 42-year-old Barashat Ditta entered into an agreement due to his cocaine addiction, the infamous criminal Neil Scarboro provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was given the nickname of "Bash", and whose criminals were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after the police surveillance operation in Scarboro, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
Officials saw 32-year-old Skarboroh keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out with his colleagues for a law society dinner.
After getting cocaine particles in the hair, its wallet, and its credit card, it was found in the investigation that Ditta was a "regular user of drugs in the A category.
During the eight-month period between January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his associate.
As part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Burkeshire and West Yorkshire, all four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail by the police after seizure of heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several impressions.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because he feared that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
After being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after three weeks of trial in the Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors, in Blackburnard, was facing ill-treatment in the Liverpool Crown Court today.
He had accepted about keeping cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad time started when while investigating Scarboro, the police came to know that he was in regular contact with DTTA on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping a drug with more than 60 percent of the accuracy under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarboro was in regular contact with Ditta on the phone, which went out for dinner at the Black Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug drug and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that he was found to be a regulatory user of cocaine in the test when he found clues of A category drug on DTTA hair, wallets and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said that his discussion was a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by removing his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his house along with his workplace, and his client used to call his house for legal matters.
After telling the arrested chief persons what the detectives knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the main people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had presented the case earlier.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "The criminal advocate should be well aware of not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, joining his distinguished client too much.
We are not talking about the common drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his boundaries of lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that he was able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting, not respecting his profession.
He made a lot of proximity to certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, who is not me, and if I want to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I will do this immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Hallsted said: At the time when Mr. Ditta started receiving drug from organized criminals, he converted himself into a criminal from a criminal advocate.
Due to the addiction of his cocaine, he made a great deal of agreement and became very weak towards the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and fill people with confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and has tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, wherein he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, which reflects our commitment to bring the criminals to court.
This matter should be a warning to criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in jail after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in America, Mohammed Ali's dinner guest and inequality inspired for his work. .
Kenya's press over disputed media law
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said, "This is a horrific place, and it is valid to ask: What is to prevent Parliament from snatching the independence of the judiciary in the coming tomorrow"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and the news website Capital FM, said, "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said that the new media tribunal "we will be biased because it is part of the government and said that the ban on content and advertisement will harm Kenya's place in the global economy."
He said, "I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send it back to the MP people."
According to the Star Newspaper, the new bill will provide strict control over the media to the government, while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya has suffered a major setback and this bill has been described as cruel.
The Bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the attack by an Islamic gunman in Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenya's media had broadcast the security camera footage of the squads sent to the attacking place, in which they showed the mall looting the mall with a purpose, due to which the officials were angry with Kenya's media.
Police chief David Kimayo sent summons to two journalists and media persons for questioning, although the summons were withdrawn after the media raged.
Under the new bill, 20 million Kenyan Shilling and different journalists can be fined on the media companies and additional risks of being removed from the list or not being given official press recognition will be different.
If the penalty is not paid, the tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the violator.
According to the Daily Nation, a penalty is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations.
It also said that due to these measures, there may be destructive effects which are described as "vibrant blogosphere" of Kenya.
By closing the media's mouth, politicians know that they can do their arbitrariness.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew Kenya writes while describing the media as a major source of control and balance in public life, "Nobody will never know."
He wrote, "After leaving the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the hunting and depositing era."
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he voted in favor of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored about 532,000 shilling per month, tax-free strong salaries, which are considered to be among the highest in the world.

UN sets new targets to deal with poverty
The United Nations is going to embark on a new group of targets that will replace Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
In order to replace the MDD that ended in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role just before the sustainable development summit that started overnight in Rio de Janeiro, in advancing the "inclusive development goals".
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that "The time has come to rise above national interests."
He said, "I am very happy that member countries have agreed to start the process and take ownership of the process to set up universal sustainable development goals."
These SDGs will be based on our development under Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to fulfill our far-reaching objectives of Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of MDGs.
The topic of Mozambique ' s security concern grows in the form of confrontation with powerful persons .

The struggle between government forces and Rey Namo for two weeks has been reported almost every day, more than 20 years before a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa, as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that there is no possibility of returning to the full-fledged struggle of the country, but recent incidents have encouraged foreign investors and local people.
The bets are high for the fast growing economy, some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Uni, to search for huge offshore gas reserves and coal reserves in the north-west, could bring some from more than 50bn investment next year.
The ruling Relimo Party, since 1975, blames each other for major political power, and the Ray Namo tension.
Ray Namo says that the government started the latest struggle on October 17 by starting attacks on its members in Sofa La province, traditional Ray Namo Garh.
With the attack on former rebels and the rise, the government forces attacked the Renamo bases and told the Financial Times trying to kill Afso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Majhang, Ray Namo spokesman.
Accusing the government of attacking the soldiers, the government blames Re Namo for the trigger.
President Armando Jibuzhan has sought to discredit concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told the AFP, French News Agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "losser" and has been trying to prove his forces that he can implement his own decision on the government.
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war .
Mr . Majang was quoted as saying , Re Namo had repealed the 1992 Peace Accord , but later became a matter of concern .
He told the UTF means that the agreement is not being honored by the free limo
Our vision is to come back for negotiations, but seriously, Mr. Majhange said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the tension of a series of conflicts this year.
"This is about two big men (Jibuzhan and Dhakama), a lecturer at Yusuf Han London Open University and a Mozambique expert said.
They are neither good negotiators, nor are they necessarily prepared to form concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been insisting on electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an effort of a sick movement to win concessions and economic robbery from the government.
Ray Namo's share in the poll is declining since 1992, while a new party was formed by a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mazang Shri Jibuzhanko, who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave Presidentship because he does not want peace, he does not want a transparent election, Mr. Majang said.
What kind of capacity is not clarified by Re Namo, but he has visited a disruptive hit and run on police stations and vehicles on a major North South Highway.
Most of the clashes are in the Sofa La province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, host Bira Port, which rely on exporting miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo line, Rio suspended his experiment for nearly a week in June.
Whether Ray Namo will be able to repeat this danger or not, Mr. Majhangwinit was almost asked.
Ray Namo Cheese was not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community, said Mr. Mazang.
The government of instability has further enhanced frustrations, Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People who are responsible for the country's future are government and president, and it seems they should be one to find solutions to problems," they say.
The Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need stability.
"No one cares about Re Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want to reach free for roads, they said.
Children should be taught as models, myths and legends for a way of "life author".
Thor ' s stories could show no subtle tricks in cruel power , while the economic legends show the significance of having a dream .
In order to teach many of the myths, it would not be appropriate to be taught in wild and in some cases even in obscene and schools, Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" from the appropriate tasks of age.
"I think it's surprising, in the United States, myth and folk songs are already a part of education, he said.
I'm advising it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers more inspiring  and this is a new turning point for children , along with messages being presented in entertaining stories .
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowolf from Anglo Saxon, wrote a Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, he said, "Your intentions can be a lot but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Probably the difference between an adult writer writing and an adult writer writing for a child needs some meanings of hope.
Everything has to come to simplified or to a happy end, because it is an intuitive sense of goodness and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather revealed through a story than said.
Not showing the old base.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of Standup Comedy in America: A hundred years ago, comedian Frank Fay, who worked as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theater in Broadway, started listening directly to the crowd in the manner of conversation.
FELE's search has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
This festival, composed and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Standup Institute, Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsh says, "Most of these headlines appeared in Carolines, and became a big success, at such a level where they became very big for playing in the club.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's programme includes the presence of Vanda Syx, Cathy Griffin and Bill Maihar, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for Military Retired Persons at the Madison Square Garden, Stand up for Heroes including Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
A number of comedians who participated in the festival this year have come from non-traditional channels such as shows on small networks such as Comedy Central, F and Spike.
Nick Kroll enjoyed Deep-Cable Sitcom (F) from the Ronchi Fantasy-Football theme The League, and now his own comedy is the Central Sketch Show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is well known for her viral video series "Marsal the Shell with Shoes On".
Other young comedians with different voices, including crawls and slates (about a disappointed voice Anthony Jasselinic, satirical, ethnic-centric W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the most prominent attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg to talk to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a standup comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on T.V. Land.
This meeting will be held at the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all the works of Larry.
They were telling me that, when they are here, sometimes they go to the street between two buildings and used to think in themselves that if I ever lost my entire money then I would be here.
Oil  96 per barrel continues to decline
On Friday , a report offset concerning over higher supplies , where the energy hungry manufacturing sector is getting stronger in China .
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at  96.24 per barrel in Electronic Trading on American Raw New York Mercantile Exchange till late morning in Europe.
The contract fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, 39 cents on Thursday.
Sufficient supply of crude oil is weighed at prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
More than five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand has increased in the activity that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come on Friday.
This shows that developments can continue to strengthen China's economic reforms after less engagement in the last quarter of 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a decade to a third.
Brent Crude also fell 26 cents from a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries,  108.58 per barrel on LIVE Exchange in London.
The court has blocked the action on the pause and sports policy of the New York Police Department .
On Thursday, a federal appeal court requires a judge's order for the break and sports program of the New York Police Department blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court Appeal 2 and Judge Shira Shindeler has said that the judge's decision will be pending on the result of an appeal by the city.
Judge Nagar had ruled in August the violation of the constitution in the way of preventing people and being excluded from their program of inquiry.
The city's police department also includes the decision to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and the training program associated with it, its findings and its treatment orders have been appealed.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request migration on Tuesday.
The Appeal Court has said that because it compromised the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and wrongful acts by the public to distinguish US judges from the code of conduct, hence the case of the judge Should be removed, public retaliation should be taken publicly to criticize the court of statements.
The judge had ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and sports program.
He has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and he becomes the most closed where a pilot program has been ordered to test the cameras worn by the body in some premises.
In August, New York City, whose cases were dismissed after a police ban, agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of those people.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and sports device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sports policy has been in some form around decades, but most black and Hispanic men have been recorded dramatically under the administration of Independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise a whole time from 684330 to 2011.
A case was filed by four men by all minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
Supporters of change in the NPC's break and sports program have said that unfair behavior will end, another more reliable and effective police force will be moulded and other police departments can influence the use of the policy.
Opponents say that the change will reduce the morale of the police, but the crime, money waste and not during the last decade, thousands of officers will solve a comprehensive problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking.
The judge has noted that there was no end to the break and the game, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NPO stop.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts attended a large number of training.
In the period of seven days, all the participants were given information about several students including tents pitching, flag pole.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
Joining the religious prayer, all the participants are spreading the spirit of unity.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar is giving special support to the State Training Commissioner.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clarke's relations while being the Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis C told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a misrepresentation in May 2005 that Clark was mixing with his "Acharshak Special Advisor Hannah Polby".
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Mulker to hack Polby's voicemail and keep that male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Edis said that "the prosecution side suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the house of the people and keep an eye on them, but they keep articles before the people. See what people react to it. "
He said that NOTW used three ways to investigate cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
The third person was involved in the editor himself.
It is obvious that he knew about other ways i.e. Nigarni, he definitely knew.
What about the first one
Did he know about phone hacking
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
Rumors about Clark's love affairs were presented by the feature desk of AOTW for the first time when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby had said: "Do not waste your time, he is with Charles.
In August 2006, the voicemail tape was seized at least three times from Ms. Polby's phone from Mulkyer home.
Investigators also found entries in the computer of the private investigator on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "Project".
During the period during which they were being investigated, anonymous phones were called to Ms. Polby's grandfather and asked for information about them.
Former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbek and former reporter James Weatherup witnessed the visit of Ms. Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis said that the involvement of Colson in this case is only in the parton with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blacket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson talked to Mr. Blacket about the love relations with a married woman, while at that time he was looking at the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who were married at that time.
Colson and Brooks refused to interfere with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200. to August 9, 2006.
Mulkair, Thurlback and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.

On the instructions of the Office (B) to protect the Constitution, the mission of Germany's domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
The German media asked FB to express hope to identify the presence of Listening Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of American National Intelligence emphasized that the US did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities in September to steal the business secrets of 10 foreign companies and to increase their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line. .
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a whistleblower, started telling the American surveillance, the leaders of the European governments and business world are no longer sure that the director does not follow his promise or not.
Told that the American National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, expressed fear about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Merkel ' s phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also making possible targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should wake up, Oliver Grn, the President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
All the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, there, however, today there is no evidence that the US has known the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of EU Internet capabilities and should strive to reduce their dependence on the US.
Business leaders are doubting about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Hasso Platner, Chairman of the German Trade Software Company SAP, said, "This is no way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted, then he did not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations revealed by Snowden about US technological refinement and espionage access have proved to be a trauma for some companies which had previously believed that the biggest surveillance risk is China .
A major change is taking place in the Cloud Computing area where European officials are more conscious that data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and hence have become potentially sensitive .
According to a survey carried out by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabbey, co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP says, "We saw a new question that customers did not come a year ago - where is my data stored And can you guarantee that it is physically in that jurisdiction Will stay
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data, and therefore they should be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is an economic spy.
It has always happened.
"It has been a subject for many years, and through the original present discussion, nothing has changed, Current Bock, Chief Executive of Chemical Producer BASE."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do it , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, message recording has been going on for a long time, even if it's unwise to leave one in the business from home, it's unwise to take a husb stick, or leave a laptop unconscious in a hotel room to say at least.
Clich Lackenberg, member of the board of the car manufacturer Audi, says that this is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BHO executive, while smart phones are compromising on foreign tours due to risks, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, these companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets effectively against lack of experience, personnel and unauthorized access to financial resources.
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of their own companies.
According to the France the Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February is named after Russia and Israel in another tier of criminals involved in hacking, economic intelligence behind China.
According to a board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when it comes to economic spying, French is the worst
In the interview, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency RI, Bernard Suarcini explains: "Services well know that all countries, even if they cooperate in non-terrorist battles, spy on their colleagues."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do it , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
No fool made it.
Parents of Georgia's teenager who died in a unique accident believe that their son was murdered
A teenager from Georgia, whose dead body was found wrapped in a resting mat in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, the family's advocate said on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA's Candrick Johnson was found trapped in a straight mat behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators of Laundes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was dead in a "bizarre" accident, but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Benjamin Grup, advocate presenting Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "He fully believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in death in the manner told by Sheriff.
He said that "He believes that this thing is beyond the logic of physical rule and general intelligence."
They think that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or the people responsible for the death of his son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag"
US Advocate General Michael Mulare said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he be murdered due to any crime
Mure said this at a press conference in the afternoon on Thursday.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring truth to the fore.
He said, "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that initial body testing indicates that Johnson's death was due to static asthma.
According to Moore, there was a different cause of death in a second body test.
He said that there are many such questions which should be answered or confirmed.
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in connection with Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of Laundage County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, the judge of Southern Georgia ordered the authorities to issue all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that the video footage will indicate how he died.
CDC issues Allergic Guidelines for Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines for controlling the food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergies.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, cases of food allergies in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this direction, schools have been informed about how to inform teachers and employees about the food allergies of children, and in case of any allergic reaction, how to handle it.
Schools have also been suggested to keep the stock of epinephrine to face potentially fatal anaphylaxis - which is the auto-engineer of Appen brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that schools can easily keep the stock of epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say "It seems that something is pricking in my tongue," it seems that there is a hair on my tongue, or "my tongue is jerking."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children ' s gender undefined
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will not be specified in a conservative manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "undefined" or "undefined" on the child's birth certificate.
The objective of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can take decisions related to gender specification surgery for newborn babies in a hurry, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll remain a wounded, stained pabbon made by doctors.
According to estimates, one child out of 2,000 children every year is such that there is no boy or girl.
They are intersexes, part of a group of about 60 conditions which come under the scrutiny of gender development disorders, it is a collective term used for abnormal chromosome, genital or testicle, or an abnormally developed sex.
It may be that Valis Simpson is intersex.
Gender identification is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender determination is not possible, it is better to use the best information available to specify sex and to do surgery, if such a problem occurs, before inspecting the child's psychological and physical development.
Dr. Jack Dresser, a psychologist of New York City, who is an expert in gender-identification affairs, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good thing".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life-crisis for which surgery is needed, but this does not happen to most children."
You can specify sex without surgery, and after that see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender develops in a child is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report filed before the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexuals as distinct from transsexual or transgender people as their condition is not related to sex but related to its biological composition, which is neither obviously male nor female, or either jointly defined or not either of them.
These features can show themselves secondary sex characteristics such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length primary sexual traits such as reproductive organs and genital or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs as well as harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-formatic gender.
Australia and Nepal have already given permission to adult persons to mark male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori Me-Welby became the world's first recognised sexless person after winning a legal appeal to keep "unspecified gender status".
According to the internal ministry, in addition to M or F in the German passport, there will also be a third specification in the form of  for intersex persons.
According to a news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw gender theory from school books.
The US website, Catholic Online, has also opposed this law of Germany, saying, "When the world is going to such a state, where gender itself is the option to be chosen, but not sexual activity, We are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn baby also told the baby zone that she would like to see the children being specified at the time of birth.
He said on the website about upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without extra limitations, especially if you do not even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, named after the beautiful Greek god who was bilingi.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender identity is a complex task, and sometimes doctors can also make a mistake, who do not know what will feel about their gender specification when children grow up.
The dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "psychiatric emergency."
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The present theory about the treatment of children with vague genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hapkins University, who regarded gender as reconstructive.
He composed the word sex identification and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents raise the child - interact with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as "Jonjoan", their principles became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child, whose sex was accidentally sexed during the cursion, to completely sterilize the child and take him out of the testicle and raise him like a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of transfer, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following "the same model".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after 1990, the people who went through these gender surgery started coming out. "There is no happiness with the result."
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with Y male chromosome, but his genitalia was ambiguous.
The doctors did not understand clearly that his sex was small, or his bhagshef was big, but he was sure that he could never live a "satisfactory life" in the form of a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, the external organ of Bruce and the testicles were removed by surgery and she was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was supposed to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and some mess, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the horrific truth.
I was sterilized at the time of birth - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, who prevented his body from making testosterones in sufficient quantity, due to which his genitals could not be developed properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, he became infertile.
Today, he explains to people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, Annie Tamar-Mattis, the executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that the law of Germany invites "chippy and stigma".
She says, "Many activists think that the law of Germany will inspire parents to make quick decisions and to specify the child "undetermined."
We fear that it will encourage interference.
Instead of waiting, we feel that specifying male or female gender is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Matis said that his organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender."
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlean Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the law of Germany will provide "power" to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full Androgen Insensitivity Symptom.
Since there was a defect in her Androgen reception, the female characteristics were developed in Katie.
There is vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is inferior, she expects to become a mother through adoption or guestational surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents to not make any decision on their own in haste."
It provides them to understand and understand them properly by some tests before writing, male or "women".
In this way, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy her.
We do not need to get such a surgery done in a hurry, which can not be returned.
He said, "This brings children in the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that inspires parents because they do not believe that they are doing well."
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex is more comfortable with - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Consider Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times , close advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton instead of Biden for Vice - Presidential post for ticket 2012 .
The most remarkable explosion in the revelation is that the heavy anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, Double Down: Game Change 2012 by Mark Halperine and John Helemann.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and on Thursday evening told that the President's top advisers can help dumping Biden in the hopes of Obama's re-election to know about the "broad group sessions" and the polling held in late 2011.
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book tells the full information about the Chief Officer's campaign and put the head bills of the White House staff for the name of the White House, to know what the change from the Vice President of the former state Clinton influences the poll.
The possible switch was a very safe mystery within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office .
Only half a dozen President's close advisers - including former Obama campaign chief Jim Macinna, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlerod and David Palouf - knew the change was under consideration.
Double Down claims that Dale tried to change Biden , despite his personal coordination , before finally deciding , when Clinton ' s ticket tells that Obama ' s situation will not improve .
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I kept an eye on the whole scene, and one of them, it was said to the newspaper.
You remember, at that time the President's post was in danger, so we were in such a situation, "The Holy Christ, what else will we do"
While Dale told the research as a precaution, Martin had told UNEC Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made significant investments to find out how much this claim will give to the pole.
 The campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups like money until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
This is ambiguous, however, did Obama know that his team is looking for change
Martin told CNN that he asked the cast, did his boss know about possible reshuffle
While Dale said that he didn ' t think the president knew about the possible change , the former Chief of Staff acknowledged that It is possible that Obama knew it .
"Double Down definitely: Will not you answer what political investigations reached Obama's desk" Martin said more.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama Biden did not know about dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps, Martin said.
Glo-in-the-Dark likes ice cream
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-the-Dark ice cream - using gelfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of sea animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came after reading a research paper on Jellyfish and China's convincing scientists used the chemical glow to reproduce the protein.
Ice cream, the eater will react with the tongue and increase the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that the ice cream shines with reacting to the heat of the mouth, i.e. winning will be more lit, the more it will be lit.
Charlie, founder of Lick MIM Delissius Icecream Company, said, "This is an incredible thing but the initial days of production will be available from me 200 to about 100 grams of goods."
The protein we're using in ice cream will react to the neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, protein will increase the PH level and ice cream will shine.
We ' re examining over the past few months and it looks exactly right to share on the helovin because it gives a marvellous effect
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that is made of maine because the glitter of gelfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds .
Although Diska taste is very good.
Hapne, including an experimental company based in Charlie's Bristol, is famous for unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves.
But his next composition is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is naturally impossible due to the ice crystal that makes refraction over the ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the reflective property of a gelfish that is synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market was lying in the Rani Bagh market with customers.
It was a matter of fact that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same happened in the Central Market located in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar.
Something similar was seen at Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Sarafa shops of Model Town.
Even here, people shopped heavily for gold and silver jewelery and coins.
For this reason, there was a jam in other markets including the external ring road.
However, people from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Helovin 2013: By Numbers
When I was small, Helovin was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to play candy food, stay late and play dress up neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more than a greedy
I did not even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and perhaps this year will not happen.
But statistics show that I ' m a black sheep when Hallowovan comes in
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating 158 million this time, spending 6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always seen is every. Helovin's tendencies.
According to NRC, the total expenditure on costumes out of 6.9 billion is estimated at 1.2 billion.
This year all are angry with sexy inanimate objects.
Women do not have to undergo vasectomy because they have sexy food like pizzas, humburgers and carrots
For Mardo, I hope a lot of zombis, and thanks to the dead, will make our instagram feeds for space men this year.
According to Google, the most searched dress will be zombis, butman, robbers and witches.
I guess there is no harm in being traditional.
Last year we dressed dogs and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to the NRC, American people will really spend 330 million for pet dress.
It's ironic that many hotdogs are with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we do not see around.
According to Nilsen Company, Americans will spend 1.9 billion this year.
Hearsy bars, lollipops, milk duds, twisers and Clark bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is a good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are participating in our neighborhood.
But actually we'll buy more jokes during 90 million pounds of chocolate helloven
According to the Confectioners Association, we will not use one thing during the heloven, candycorn, but they will also sell about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion individual knot of Mecca.
It's a mystery, so far to solve.
Nothing more is in comparison to the continental Helovin Bhutia houses.
They're the best name, "Terror behind the wall (who, actually is a prison), "Chick-o-Chich" and "House of Shawk."
In fact, according to American power, there are 1200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in United States which generate 500 million revenues, and those terrible good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes you and comments on Nice face.
Finally, talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were children and a Jack-o-Lalten carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is what we have done since we were small.
Luckily for us, "Baby in a pumpkin trend " started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and neither staying with them."
According to the US Census Bureau this year, the US will spend on pumpkins around  106 million.
Jack-o-slowly furious lanterns on their front porch perhaps from Illinois, which increased from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you are looking for additional loans, please try to insert phone tim and susan matisads in Napa, Kalif.. and above them 2,032 pounds of pumpkin.

A fire fighting team was called to save a lost puppy at the mouth of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above ground in a mine.
Cocker Spanish Ruby ran away after a small road collision
He was seen by a Dog Walker who was stranded in the mine three days later .
Firefighters lower the front portion of the rock to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After being trapped by Puppy on the face of a catastrophic mountain 50 feet above the ground in some way, the call of firefighters gave him a fortunate life.
Nine-month-old cocker Spanish Ruby ran away after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent 3 days alone before being saved from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owners Scott Alderson, 25, and their girlfriends Becky Hall, 20, were in the flapit mine in Pashmichi Yorkshawir to meet Ruby, and thanked the Western Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After his escape after a small accident, he searched for his lost dog like a madman, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharp-looking Dock Walker saw Ruby on the mountain in the mine at a height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team arrived at the spot from Clackheaton Fire Station and landed down through the rope to save Ruby and used a stomach tube to bring it down from the rock.
Expert Technical Rescue Officer Andy Cleton said: "He was in a critical situation.
He was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not do any action during the rescue, the stone remained.
But now he is good.
After that he was eating biscuits.
It was a call of absolutely unusual help.
Rather it is incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is left in a lucky way."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse situation.
Ruby was taken to a veterinary doctor for examination, where she was found to be better than exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, Western Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first I did not believe how he reached there.
It is amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinary doctor said that if he was very tired and fell, he would definitely fall down.
The fire fighting team did a very good job.
What they did is actually a very courageous task.
We are grateful to them, and they were all excellent.
Mr. Alderson also said from Kegali: "We were afraid that he could fall, but he was there."
The fire fighting team did a great job.
I do not believe how he reached there.
Mick Jaeger says that when Katie Perry was 18, he did not strike him.
During an interview with Australian Radio Show this week, Pon Star said that he sang backing walks for Jaeger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that he had dinner with senior rocker, and "When I was 18, he attacked me."
He said that "This thing became outdated, and he treats me well."
The 70-year-old Jaeger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he clearly refuses to attack "Kati Pari" at any time.
The representative also said: "Perhaps Parry is saying about them in the misunderstanding of another person."
Pari was one of the singers coming as a guest on the rolling stone tower this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top position this week.
George Careven : Euro decomposition gave Scotts the option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join Europe as an independent travel territory as a condition for membership of the EU.
Passport control on Barvik and indicate stories about the boundary of barbed wire on the walls of the Hadrian.
It is true that Strathclide Paper describes the potential economic benefits of free travel with the rest of Europe, although predictably - it was not described in Headlines.
Nor did anybody describe that EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer a Shangan area, Brussels will actually be cheaper for non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what they want from Scotland.
So, then, a-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen. First of all, "Independence" means that passport control was heard about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point in reciting this interesting old story was lost.
Anyway, why should independent Scotland expect Europe's bidding
Why should London Yok be bought and sold for Brussels, especially now
Here is the real European news: the great plan to organise Europe, the post-war plan has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe is officially dead.
The dedicated teams are strengthening to oppose the EU in the entire EU or to shut down the Euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscapable Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and secured nearly fifty lakh votes in the federal elections of September, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our Lib Dems).
The plan to build a federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical changer.
With the stringent rules laid down by Berlin and European Central Bank, due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone far away.
The Euro crisis did not have much role in the high budget deficit of the national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its members in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deep European productivity is sick beyond the current budget and currency problems.
In order to give exemption to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers - as a result of the "green energy policies" imposed by Brussels, the European industry doubles electricity for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United Nations.
This crippling cost is loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even freezing all salaries in the world cannot save the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians saw the EU as a means to control Germany, and to provide Paris a billing equivalent to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is staggering.
Result: Marine Lee Pen's right wing, the anti-EU National Front has won the third by-election by pushing the ruling socialist to third place.
At present, the front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent vote - it is a warning to the British Labor as usual that they cannot assume that disintegration to the left will automatically benefit to the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with French Europeans, their new fame in the working class
The party wants to use the next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, anti-monetary group in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can first affect the European Parliament.
My vision is: soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be completely finished, but it will return to retail H (sovereign) nations in some form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaulle.
Germany and some of its faulty economies can maintain the euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currencies.
I hope the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of getting closer to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easy for non-unional nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP Government in Scotland has been the most successful anti-economic campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib-Dem Alliance (Those Implemented) deductions proposed by Labour Chancellor Elister Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of economics imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature Puberty: Being quick
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get puberty at an early age compared to their age white girls.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near .
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a cause of puberty in young age
Premature puberty case is not so effective in boys .
PAT Etheriz, former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist on the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 years and genital hair
Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a pediatrician endocrinologist at the annual conference of the US Pediatrics Academy in Orlando, Florida this week, clarified that these initial physical changes are common to American girls, they show new trends.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in assuring parents that it usually does not reflect rapid progress towards full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as sprouting of breasts, genitals and hair of the eye and physical smells are seen prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a slight change in the age of menstruation (first menstruation).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breasts begin to grow, it takes at least two to three years in the first preservation ," says Caplovitz , who is also the author of the guide to deal with this common problem . "
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of youth, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, it is called "born-adult".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - whose pediatrician can closely inspect.
In case of rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to check the possibility of serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are remedies for delaying premature menstruation and other consequences: premature age-growth of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and stiffness in the form of adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on child age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of medicines but acknowledge, "Pressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can feel different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and returned disturbed that in his friends, he first started menstruation.
There are many well-known principles about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no continuous evidence that hormones, chemicals in the environment or sexually oriented messages in the media can be charged in milk or other food items.
Boys - like girls - are getting premature youth.
Caplovites determine this rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting studies on girls of 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects body fat with puberty time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before their age white girls.
There are many explanations about this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting face and genital hair at a young age, the trend of complete youth is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians who attended the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it is common to see puffs and genital hair.
"We need to be careful about how we recognize the actual beginning of puberty," says Dr. Laurens Silverman, a pediatrician and endocrinologist at Goreb Children's Hospital in Mauritius Town, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their pediatrician to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It can mean to negotiate before the expected time."
If you remain calm then your child will usually answer properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even though it is happening prematurely, it is a part of normal life.
On Thursday, the temperature was recorded at 3.1 degree Celsius.
Rain and cold air on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wear sweaters and move towards markets and their destination.
People have also removed the quilt on the first rain of winter.
In the morning people also enjoy the sunshine.
As the weather changes, there will be a lot of relief from the disease, but after that there was a cloudy cloud throughout the day, the sun shade continued.
The children also reached their school wearing a sweater.
At the same time, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degree Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degree Celsius on Thursday.
While 7.8 mm of rain was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, the sky will remain cloudy even further.
Big orders of jet manufacturers at stake by dispute for seat width .
A race has taken place while setting up a quarrel for this month's Dubai Arches between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights
The dispute is focused on the width of the Economy Class seat in long flights planes, not always like being given by the airlines, but whose allocated location efficiency has claimed to be the key to the latest jet arbus SAS and Boeing Company. .
This week Erabus gives a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- cm -RRB- in the Economy Cubin , such an industry standard is expected , but it should be decided by the airlines , according to his chief opponent Boeing .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the incident of 17-21, there was a competition to sell long-range Eracraft's twin engines to the big version of the order recorded.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - specifically whether the seating 9 or 10 is equal, keeping in mind the claims of more capacity, the design of mini jambo jets is being prepared
Boeing says this is ' 777 ' which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 in one line in anonymous department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people to 18-inch seat and 9 seats.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 777 , Dubai Archo is expected to dominate more than 100 orders, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the Vigian war has started, will you accept it together in a restaurant showing this to Finsero
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said, "The Boeing Regional Turbo is also presenting long distance flights in narrow seats."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way of sitting in the plane is not changed.
According to the US Health Department statistics, during the 1970s, when Boeing 747 Jambo One defined the modern long-term Ki Journey ko, and the anti-me average 40-49 year old American male weight increased by 10 percent.
According to American Health Statistics, the average American male waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its opponent is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the new name was narrow on the average periphery of the jet set .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission, which suggests improvement in the quality of an additional inch 53 percent sleep in the width of the seat.
Boeing argued on the figures of the seat measurement of the Airbus , and has said that it is not dependent on the decisions of the manufacturers as to how there is a balance between the airlines fares and facilities .
It also says, research shows that the width of one seat depends on the experience of the cabin more than the width.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawer has said that it actually tells about the flexibility of the airlines and the facts that what is required to be done to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they benefit from.
They know better about their business than someone else.
This elbow is about the room for flyers, but for suppliers it is an issue fast that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute, the trade estimate of at least  700 billion is that the aircraft order competition is sufficient in the coming decades to tip the scales of American and European exports.
Reuters report said for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a fight issue between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that every seat has 20 percent workforce, in the new twin engine design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 errors.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends on the 10 ' s 777 ' x ' original 9 ' s comparison with the 777 ' design .
10 equivalent with profit in unit cost is now used.
Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Passenger Facility of Europe, says, "This plane of Boeing is doing to capture more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat per line cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the Denser layout, which can also go with cheap rent.
The Runway Girl Network of Cabin Internal Expert Mary Karbie, Founder and Editor said that the eighteen-inch seat width would be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this trade point of Airbus is operated by the threat of 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to choose from suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors from all over the world also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While relaxing, all builders are also offering high density layouts for low-cost airlines of jets and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but it is not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus emphasized on some of its jet planes for broader cabin seats to need more cabin facilities.
Modern jet planes are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can distract 777  from the wave of sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can enjoy smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end the fun of smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was capable of keeping rats safe from nicotine addiction for the whole life.
Man needs further testing before starting the test, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the systems present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus which has been designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus infects the liver cell selectively, which then starts to create a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from raising nicotine in the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given mice that were later given nicotine continued to do their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine felt "good, it was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
There was a dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe then it can be given to children before the greed to try cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said that "he will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any joy from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do a lot of research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not rise due to the actual cause of the death of the tigress.
The forest department is giving a round-the-clock reply to the death of the tigress in the first place.
On Thursday night, the forest workers of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tigress near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Nallah.
As all the parts of the body of the tigress were safe, there were no traces of injuries or injuries etc. on it.
On Friday, the post mortem of the body of the tigress was done by CTR's veterinary doctor Bharat and Kotabagh's veterinary doctor Hema Rathore in the presence of forest guard Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kaksha Nasim, SDO GS Karki.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tigress is being said to be bad.
This did not detect the reasons for the actual death of the tigress.
On the death of the tigress, the departmental officials continued to respond.
Yet the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topsychological examination to confirm the poison.
Forest patron Vivek Pandey told that the death of the tigress can be called natural.
There are no symptoms of poison etc. from the body of the tigress.
Yet, with the search of the surrounding area, it is being sent to the Bisra investigation to confirm the poison.
Tripodi denies us being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joey Tripodi has refused to refute the policy of maritime lease on the request of his political guru AD Obide, the patron of former New South Wales, Eddie Obide, who had hidden selfishness in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICA) on Friday detailed that whether Mr. Obide had renewed the circulars of lobbying policy from several State Ministers where two Obide-owned restaurants and cafes, without tender, were renewed after its expiry in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, after the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the hidden interests of Mr. Tripodi Mr. Obid of this allegation
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized for launching public tender for leases.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprises for leases, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, were renewed from tender without leases.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargah from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi urged a change in the government lease policy .
Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obide after the Ministry of Ports worked in ICA in August and September 2007.
Asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healy Mr Tripodi. Was the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case
"No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I couldn't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter planes targeted the Syrian port city of Lataki on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.
The official did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The report of the Associated Press shows that the target was Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has missed air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees can undergo Authenticity Test on 457 visas
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign employees on 457 visas, because its purpose is to expand a rigorous action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria designed for filling up unskilled posts in Australia or preventing 457 experiments to be used to transmit family and friends in a covert manner.
A Government Discussion Paper was issued today, condemning the government's verbalism about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine Macque said today that it can anger the neighbouring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "strong rhetoric about the job before the Australian people is very unpleasant repetition at such a time, while the unions have demanded a safe labor market."
Historically, it meant that white labour should have been protected and if some people in the area had seen the echo of that historical evidence, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper depicts the outline of 12 measures which were earlier considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brendan Oconner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the remaining are under consideration.
If the "authenticity criteria" is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined in this regard as to whether the enrollment is true in such circumstances, in which the nominee, the owner of the visa sponsor or related person is related to the person or personal partner. "
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees, hired hundreds of people.
During this period, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after a refugee boat arrived on Christmas Iceland this week.
The distressed nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, an adult cousin has tied up the strap, which was on the same vessel.
Australian officials transported the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 rail project.
Work by US2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baronus Kramer said that this project will be "UK" one.
Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he is very excited to work with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Once the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England from 32. 7 billion to 42.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland transport, instructed US2 Limited to consider the possibility of further improvement in rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Barones Kramer: Our goal for US2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be added well due to FS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael to Scotland's obvious return to the US2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to get huge economic benefits from high speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire UK of high speed rail."
Therefore, we are excited to work in partnership with the British Government so that we can examine the options for bringing high speed rail in Scotland, generating profits for all and fulfilling the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and taking further decisions.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules will remain effective in Australia now
Despite the softening of equipment related regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue closing their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing the aircraft.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to American Air Force Service Companies to change their procedures so that during the important phases of the flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment, provided they are in the tool Yuvan Mode. Stay in
Passengers can do this during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Air Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Services Companies will have to do a lot of work to fulfill this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of power equipment are still effective in important phases of flight in Australia.
At present, CASA does not have any specific regulations to control the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft, the Authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operating companies have to ensure that the security arrangements are always made. And the passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members. "
Virgin, who is already negotiating with CASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked for further action on the instructions of the regulator. .
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by DASA in the matter of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) Our planes are in. "
uantas said that it will follow the current rules right now.
It said that "According to our current policy, electrical equipment can not be used during flying and landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
CADA decision applies to American allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will certainly consider the reasons behind CAAA's decision.
The impact of this decision will vary on each US aircraft service company and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft Service Companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio manipulation from mobile devices as well as modify their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and brief details to the passengers.
LADA said that after verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, they will allow travelers to hold hands on all heights, light weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to shut down their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper coaches while flying and landing.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and swings to pay her daughter's school fees in a ponshop in Bendemire shopping center in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is trapped in it."
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 US dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia where domestic debt is on the rise - Valuemax, where they are doing their transactions, became the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
To mortgage ornaments is not the only way to get cash - in Ms. Amirthalinga's case, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost unsafe bank loans are as cheap as it is.
Usually, in Singapore, Ponbroker takes 17 interest per annum, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not having a credit check or proof of salary, and they can provide credit at a faster pace than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning to Ponshops due to rising costs of living by families and difficulties due to increase in domestic and consumer credit.
Due to strong growth over five years after the global financial calamity and slowdown in cheap credits due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle-income families are turning to ponshops to meet their needs.
This week, Rating Agency, Standards Ang Poor's described increasing domestic gains mainly due to mounting mortgages as a risk factor for credit eligibility of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 of GDP, compared to 60 in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from the technology recession this week.
On Thursday, data has shown a continuous export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
Song Seng Wun, economist at Malaysian Bank, CIMB, said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, [income scale] people coming from lower classes will try to increase their income in every possible way. Will try. "
Historically high values in gold values over the last two years have inspired people to mortgage individual assets as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the values of their family ornaments.
70 percent of the items mortgaged in 200 pon outlets of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The sense of gold is good, let's pledge the grandmother's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Ezimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of subscribers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of pledging that in Bendimir, the operator of the outlet Value Max and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia. Planning to expand, Valuemax executive director Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it with 60 of Singapores 66 million received in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that mortgage is not only cheaper than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase credit.
They say, customers mortgage things that they already have, and redemption of personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Ponbroking's social acceptance is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that ponbrokers only use financially weak people.
In Singapore, rich people also use valuemax outlets, they mortgage gold bars or rollex watches, which can get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of society.
Ms. Yah says, "These include rich people who need short-term loans for business enterprises or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
Mukesh Ambani, India's largest businessman, is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a big party on this occasion.

These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife poetry Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously when such a big name joins the party, you can guess how big this jalsa will be.
325 Million Rescue Package for TAGI Health
The Union Government has stressed that strict conditions are also linked to the rescue package of  325 million for Tasmania's sick health system, which will ensure that the state government can not waste the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the old population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The financing over four years was decided after consultation with the Government of Tasmania Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
Ms. Plibersek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges faced by the state.
The package of  325 million includes an alternative surgery plan of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous accumulated cases.
This includes walk-in clinics at Hobart and Lansastation, better care after departure from the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health recording system in local hospitals.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading doctors.
The Minister emphasized that Tasmania's government will face tough reporting and accountability governance.
The State has to maintain the current financing level to obtain Commonwealth funds, and report every month where extra funds are being spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the State is served as effectively as possible and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that the meaning of 325 million dollars will not be very high until real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level.
Yet, he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope the federal aid package will be very helpful in separating the state public health system from the crisis-stricken list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly reverse the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution".
He told ABCTV, "We are here because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You cannot consider taking about half billion dollars by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth as a good news day.

There is a description of the best production design and time duration in the transformation of the novel of Dennis Diderot, but it has become more than what it should have been.
Showing the time of the year 1760 of France, this novel narrates the tragic story of Sujan, the young nobleman, who sends the convent of his family member.
When he revolts, he faces excessive cruelty at the hands of the voluntary oppressor Mother Superior, and becomes an object of compassion for the other.
This film never goes into compassion or sensation - and this is the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the storytelling, there is also the risk of becoming a boring film for the audience.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to build chemical weapons
On Thursday, the monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed important equipment for making chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are considered to be kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war that began almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the last date of 1st November .
The Hague-based organization had set Dumscus to mix chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and destroy the machinery used to fill war materials or make it "ineffective".
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious event, aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Dumscus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus still has to destroy the weapons and collection present.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including Mustered Gas and Nervous Agent Sarin.
The UK situation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safera city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is a chemical weapon production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which has details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this 61,067 civilians including 6,365 children are included.
On behalf of the government it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of Assad's military army, 18,678 are fighters in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah is militant.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing struggle since March 2011.
It has not updated data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have become strong to leave the country.
Assad's army continued to fight the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people have been casualties on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time frame.
The statement to OPCW, which worked with the United Nations, said that its team is still satisfied and has confirmed - and all the declared important production and mixing equipment of Syria - have been seen in the destroyed form. .
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 out of 23 centres declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been abandoned and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safera was one of the two centres where the OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has proposed a plan for complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
Ahmat Ujumku, Director General of the Group, who monitored the comment issued by OPCW, said, "I salute the determination and enthusiasm displayed by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization so far. . "
This civil war, which has been running for three years, is mainly the government of Assad and its security forces, in which Shia emerged from Islam, including members of the Eit cult, and there is a conflict between rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdur Rahman said that there was a strong explosion in the Air Defense Center in Latakia, the coastal region of Syria on Wednesday.
He said that the reason for the blast is not known yet.
Police have recovered photographs of fake registry, counterfeit seals, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused included Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Haboval, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and recordkeeper Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office, used to take out papers from the records of empty and old land and then purchase new stamp papers and prepare them for counterfeit registry.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, the fake registry was given in the record.
After this the accused used to sell the land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was kept accounting for the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry were keeping a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told in the interrogation that they have so far prepared fake registry around 150.
According to the police, cases of cheating and theft were registered against gangster Rajiv earlier.
Resentment on the conviction of the bomb blast in Bali
The relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the conspirators of the bomb blast, said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran for nearly 10 years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the death penalty of this person, called the infamous "destructive person" as a master person making bombs.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of Jun Cortein, a woman living in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Preventing his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told AAP, "He should be placed in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
On October 12, 2002, the name of this club was erased after the bomb blast loaded in a steep van outside the whole club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar at the time of the explosion, exactly 20 seconds before the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide bombers.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, he went to a month-long coma and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have been given the same sentence, which was received by three other members of the Jammah Islamiah militant group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be punished before anyone else.
Look, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be punished from Bali bomb blasts.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but ultimately in January 2011, he was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US Army had killed former Al aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender.
Even today, it is not really sad to hurt so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "This year many tears will flow."
Still Patek can appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Aircraft travelers can now use the gadget in the aircraft (but can not call from cell phone)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device for reading, working, playing games, watching movies, listening to music from entering the gate to descending from the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - it is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huarta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft completes the new guidelines and how they are updating the training books of their crew members and the rules for collecting the devices to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetblu are among the airlines who have already submitted plans.
FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can soon approve the expanded use of electronic devices."
At present, passengers need to shut down their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft's door is closed.
They are expected to not run the aircraft till they reach the height of 10,000 feet and allow them by Captain.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices while landing, and do not turn it on until the aircraft is completely descended.
The FAA said, under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircrafts are fully protected by electronic disruption can allow their passengers to fly by aircraft, aircraft while landing and the device at the time of taxi.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these norms.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airline companies to do this - it will be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we are bored to feel like "Hall Monitors".
The agency said that but surfing by connecting internet at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, email exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be restricted.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no talks with friends, a game like online scrabble, which is the famous incident that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the door in 2011, and refusing to shut down the device, the American airlines had dropped him off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their bounce will worry about the injury to another person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory rights relating to phone calls are with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
FAA can lift restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transport Security Board, who is the National Transport Security Expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risky.
Rosenkar said, "Cell phones are actually a serious issue, but not because they can potentially interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they are in the air, they can create disruption in cell phone towers. . "
Industry Advisory Committee constituted by FAA last month has recommended that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The pressure on FAAs has been increasing in recent years to reduce the ban on their use.
Critics like Sen. Claire McCassilk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
It is becoming more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996, when the passengers received a report of disruption in navigation and communication equipment due to transportation of FM radio and high-tech gadgets of that time.
New airlines are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising heights from passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said that most airline companies should meet eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit very few power radio transmissions compared to the last generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers are totally nominal transmissions during page reversal.
But transmission is strong when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favor the reduction of restrictions on the use of the device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems, but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed emotions about the risks posed by the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said that he believes that the interference with the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are reports described by the pilot only in support of the device interruption in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that FAA pilot be allowed to order the passengers to shut down the device when the aircraft is landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them the common knowledge facility of people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Do, CEO, US Travel Association said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that travellers travelling with joy are not incompatible with safety and security.
While learning from the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT Police has taken a stand for the uick Reaction during the celebration of Diwali in view of security and during the emergency situation.

For protection from the North Sea Rig, the bird was left back in the jungle by air transport
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released back from the coast by air transport in the forest.
This bird named Water Rail was sent to Aberdeen by the helicopter before the Scottish SPA returned to his rescue center in Eloa.
Center Manager Colin Seden said: "This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of North Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the Northern Sea."
It seems the bird was tired and he took refuge in the oil rig.
He further said that: "It was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the water rail became healthy and fit.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with Britain
The Business for Britain was launched in April and it was pledged to bring the business together and determine the changes in our relationship with the UKs Employment and Prosperity Producer EU.
For this, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of British business leaders and asked them what their views were about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders, representing the business size, regions and locations of the UK.
The findings of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large portion of businessmen now wants to export outside of Europe, and wants to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member countries are becoming stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, and not to be involved in the long and difficult process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far greater than the benefits of being part of Europe's trading sector - even the vast businessmen who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent of them agreed.
Finally and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move ahead on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was observed in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are inspiring a meaningful change, which will give back its lost power to the UK.
Its price is very high - the issue of conversion of treaty for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 per cent in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: The survey shows that UK businessmen support his plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renew a meaningful change in favour of the UK in favour of the present power balance.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming very fast as Eurozone is moving forward in the direction of a bounded economy and a fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that for businesses it means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulation process.
Gazprom's Alexey Miller explains the start of a new round of pipelines in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the beginning of the construction of South Stream Gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today a historic event has happened: Construction started on the Bulgarian part of South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe, Gazprom President Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday. "

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission heard
Two employees of YMCANSW have been charged with child sexual offences before being charged against Jonathan Lord, a caretaker child care employee in 2011.
But in his statement before the Commission, it said that it never revealed a case of child sexual harassment within its organization, the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an YMCA employee was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offenses against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare from advocate Gal Fernes, who assisted the Commission, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that YMCAs statement before the Commission that an external investigation of YMCA has been carried out and they have found YMCA at the forefront in the matter of child safety is also not accurate.
It is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified and received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is attached to YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that due to the appointment of Lord, "Managing himself, including me, has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees were informed about child safety policy violations. Be aware of their obligations related to giving information.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year tenure in YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not inform the Lord of child safety violation.
The employees gave the evidence that they saw about the violation, in which Lord spent time alone with the children, privately babysitting them, lapsing them, telling them that he loves them and playing them on their mobile phones Including to play.
Daniel Auckwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and had said for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that YMCA, who supervised the Lord, was "very threatening" and difficult to get most of the time.
The CEO said that it did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
He said that, rather his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his point of view to the YMCANSW Mandal that "Jonathan Lord was about not giving information" to the organization from the incident.
Mr. Hare said that shortly after the charges came to light, the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees was made by YMCA's Child Services Manager, Lium Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not "excited and executed correctly".
Stephen Smallbon, Special Professor of Child Sexual Harassment, University of Griffith said that YMCANSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to be the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After quitting office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr. Blair restricted most of his comments to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and the Middle East group of peace architects to a great extent.
Asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, of course, but this is not likely to happen, so...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When there was a crowd of experts performing horses for the best horse of the year in Cardiff, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
He did not even go to school and a few months away from taking his first step, the little child and his petty Shetland's Tattu Toffee easily completed three phases and won the top prize - left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the Annual Competition organized by Sunnyback Equatorial Centre in Rudri, near Cardiff, there was a lot of appreciation for the appearance, behaviour and style of the unseparable pair of pairs that are lengthy Sk.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful ball hats, he slid his flat hat on the angle of the angle and made his two-year-old toffee rotate the ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for their natural skills of control which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given a gift to Toffee on his third birthday in March last, and he has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland since then.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great pair."
He had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cups and rosettes.
This was the second occasion when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy to win it.
The most different in this theater, they all felt so amazing that they wanted to photograph with him.
This young child from Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wales is walking on footprints of his anti-Sharon Hawles, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Howells said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everybody was celebrating and clapping.
He was running on the sand in the whole theater, and despite seeing so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is crazy for animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chicken poultry, which he takes care of.
The way he has started, it will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am sure he will perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton's age is only three years, but it comes to control its tattoo."
They are very good pairs.
The decision makers pointed out the manner in which Fenton and Toffee displayed and the manner in which they performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tattu and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am confident that Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
The arguing Chinese newspaper will be "renovation"
A Chinese newspaper, which had made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter convicted of defamation, will be restored, said a press regulator.
Guangjau's newspaper New Express gave a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongjau.
But after that, Mr. Chain accepted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a fabricated news about the state-owned company.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to undergo a complete improvement.
"The order of reform came from Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published many false news about the listed company oomloyan in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that the editorial management of "New Express" was disorganized.
It said that it decided to impose an administrative penalty by canceling the license of the reporter of "Chen Yongjau".
It had instructed the "Yangchen Evening News Group" to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in New Express and to immediately modify the leadership team of the New Express.
Mr. Chain wrote a number of articles in the New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction-production company named oomloyen.
After his detention, his newspaper published two home page appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chain's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chain came to the state television and accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV that "In this case, I have damaged oomloyan as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the people."
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chain's apology, the New Express issued a home page apology stating that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have acknowledged the TV broadcast defect.
Experts say that from time to time, accusations are made, despite a law in the second half of this year, the authorities had banned the authorities from compelling them to blame themselves.

US-Mexico Drug Tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
US officials have described a tunnel of four feet and three feet as one of the most complicated secret routes so far discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to a curved length of about six football pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of similar godowns, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said that it was closed before the tunnel passed through a drug.
According to the records of the court, officials have seized eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the search of the tunnel.
Three persons, about whom the officials told that they were working as drivers, were accused of keeping marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, they can be punished from 10 years of imprisonment to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona take advantage of vast underground drainage canals.

British police sent extradition notice to Assange
The British Police sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today, who has taken shelter in the Ecuador Embassy in London and requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said that he has sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to attend the police station, and also said that if he fails to do so, he will be responsible for arresting himself.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual offenses charges, and his options under British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand them over to the US, due to this fear, he had requested for asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, telling the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said that Scotland Yard has sent an surrender notice to the 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to be present at the police station on the date and time we selected.
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on giving police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 US political cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible detective charges.

Tax on foreign property owners to end London's artificial situation
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osbourne, who introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and for persons who prefer to keep a house in a company rather than a separate person.
In the tax year 201213, stamp duty from residential assets in Westminster and towns of Kensington and Chelesa was 708 million, which is more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hambur.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a proper minimum tax on high value property, which is not related to the effect of the old council tax system. . "
He added , But this step can make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and reluctant to sell to the present owners .
In prime property, wealthy South-West London, the top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record 11.8 percent increase last year.
According to Savilles' research, there was a regular increase of 5.6 percent each year in central London prices, but the growing "normal market" appeared to be slightly lower as compared to the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) is seen.
Scientists have further highlighted the subject that there is a connection between the dog's tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs shake their tail more on the right (for dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tail primarily on the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this microscopic distinction of tail and can react to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Georgia Wellertigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trainto, said: "In humans, all this is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are included in different ways in the excitement that produces positive or negative feelings.
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He told that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To know more about how dogs react to shaking one-sided tail by other dogs, researchers kept an eye on animals watching other dog movies.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand that their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellatigra said: "We presented dogs with films of dogs - in a shadow picture to deal with realistic editions or other issues that are confused, and we could see the movement of the tail and present the tail more left or right. Could. "
When the animals saw an emotional dog shaking his tail on the right side (from dog's point of view), they remained completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning the direction primarily towards the left (again from the point of view of a dog), his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellatigra, he does not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they shake their tail on one side continuously, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience. . "
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, veterinary doctors and trainers.
John Breadshaw, a specialist in the behavior of dogs, Fellow of the School of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Bristol, told that it is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other researches in the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "On the contrary to the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left rather than the right, there was more chance of reaching the dogs instead of being restless."
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs did not understand animals or robot dogs completely in dog films.
He clarified that it could help the study of the way dogs react to real dogs.
"When there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is yet to be obtained - and in this case dogs are not exceptions, he said. "
However, considering the easier their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis to announce first cardinal name in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest class pastors in the Catholic Church, whose post is below the Pope only, and those who select the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals who will ultimately help him choose his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope election - it comes in the group of 120 Cardinal electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the celebration of the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be organized, which is called the Pope-Sabbha.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell its decision to organize the Pope Council in February so that it will be easy to plan other meetings with cardinals participation from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the same number of cardinals, and the number of cardinals above 80 years of age as per their wish.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Sabha will be important, because this will be the first Pope-Sabha after Francis's election in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see if new popes are nominated from the rest of the world to restore balance."
Forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to explore ways to improve the church, will be the first cardinals to be selected after the formation.
Prior to this, the Pope used to decide all the things themselves.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it is possible to seek advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we are not the first in this situation - it is completely new.
Valero said that generally the Pope gives the post of Cardinal to the bishops of big places, but Francis was completely surprised - so we do not know whose name they will declare.
To correct the seatback, GM called back pickup trucks in the US
According to an information from US Auto Security Regulators on Friday, about 19,000 trucks have been called back to correct a shortfall in the hand-rotating seatback in General Motors Company, its entirely new 2014 Shevralley Silverrado and GMC Sira pickup trucks.
There may be a shortage in the front seat rotating system in some trucks.
As a result, the union failed to comply with the auto safety standards regarding seatback, head restraint.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Security Administration, "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks started to be dispatched in June and this is the most important vehicle launch for the top US automaker after insolvency renewal of 2009.
GM had told truck owners about this defect in the latter half of October.
The owner could not review the notification letter due to NSTMA 16-day official captive, which had disrupted the sale of auto in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of silverrado and Sira trucks which were redesigned for the 2014 Model Year were 20 increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silver rods and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the share of GM in New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent bounce.
Obama's voter's disappointment
I voted Obama twice in expecting a change
He says that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to GOP's policy of blocking.
Obstruction policy can not excuse Obamacare website's problems, drone attacks
Reminiscence of the 2008 Campen of Obama reminds me of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I feel that this second year will encourage me during the depression of medical school and will give me a hopeful ray of hope.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get rid of my patients' leaflets at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
The elections proved unilaterally, and news speakers took a break to show the historical significance of that time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A team of young visionaries was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During Obama's becoming president in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they appear to be a distant memory, a tragic memory of lost opportunities.
After I was voted for the first time, there was really a change.
Simply, I could not imagine any of this.
I give credit to Obama for many achievements, from the Afordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask", until Osama bin Laden is killed."
Further, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country, including immigration reforms, public options for healthcare, closure of base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But in the innumerable times in which I favored the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I got the answer that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican opposition policy is not an answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is there an answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency to collect data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of those who expose the wrong movements of the government.
It can not explain the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L. Awlaki without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limits that are reduced during President Campen.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts to silence the media by the White House have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed in the law of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether I had expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I had to guess that the governance system could repudiate the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predictable route as opposition political parties and random incidents such as the Newtown murder case will shape our public discussion.
Yet the examples I have given above, mostly appear to have been chosen by the administration.
This thing makes you the most upset.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not seem to determine his policies or his post.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill those hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I miss his disappearance promises.
A part of the book was reading this week, describing how Clinton had suffered a major loss due to Obama in Pennsylvania Primary.
In a post-mortem camping meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return to the tracks, and need to remain integrative on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you more.
The views expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that PM Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral leave scheme was a conflict

Should the result of the election come two months after our voting

Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencil to mark ballot papers.
That's because if a person does not like him, can he erase him
Using pencil in today's era seems absolutely absurd.

The litigants had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the rapidly growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that criminals have become unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBI suspended two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, the case has received information from two persons, another indication that the global investigation by regulators in the dubious manipulation of the currency market is progressing at a fast pace.

People familiar with the case said that FSB, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also examined internal investigation, or have received requests for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely investigating quick messages and emails equivalent to many years in search of clues for any wrong activities.

Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very huge and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that this is true.
Senior trader said that despite the excessive quantity of foreign exchange purchase-seller, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by banks means that "you can start affecting the market at a slightly low ticket price. . "
This news came on the day Credit Suisse announced the release of the trader from his Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.

It is true that our work can not work without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for life, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the god of wealth Kuber and the death god Yamraj.
Wealth has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
Good and bad is our sense of money.
There can be no other thing more valuable than the wealth that came in the welfare of humanity, but the money that became the cause of egoism has no meaning.
We earn money for the sacred purpose and spend only for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted collection or yen-ken money destroys our discretion, personality.
The spirit of donation should always be in mind.
A portion of the money you have given can also be the basis of someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible absence, we all should think for them.
In fact, equal importance has been given to meaning, religion, work and salvation in the menstruation of life.
All people wish for wealth and fame and according to their pursuit, they also get wealth and fame.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is connected.
No matter how wealthy a criminal is, he can neither consume it properly nor can anyone else be used.
If someone else has money, do not envy him.
The true wealthy is the same who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of money.
There can be no more use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also be in the form of love for your health, character, others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continues to stop the sale of kerosene through ration, then kerosene will not be available in these shops in half a dozen states.
States where kerosene sales are to be closed include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, in some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the North-East, it is also preparing to close the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basis.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being made fast in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in most of the rural households in which LPG connections have been given.
The Petroleum Ministry has prepared a lot in this regard.
Sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been closed since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced significantly to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg liters to one lakh kg liters.
In the allocation of Uttarakhand, 70 percent of the kerosene quota of Haryana was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this deduction, there is no news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry is convinced that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently a difference of 37 rupees.
This encourages adulterators.
In states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.

Which party did it

But when the Congress or its support government was formed, the poor man was not fortunate to eat enough.
A single leader of the Congress, a single leader of the UPA, is not answering what he did in nine and a half years.
Even the media persons of our country can not reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They do not even answer the media persons.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.

There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends keep leaving balloons on the day they come.
Friends, we have given exams 10 months ago.
In democracy, the public only tests.

They will also check whether the opinion of legislators and MPs has been taken in the list.
If needed, the list will be largely altered to give place to old and committed workers.
The legislators-MPs are generally accused that the opinion of those people was not taken in the list of nominations.
The names of people who came after many other parties have been recorded in the list, whereas many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
Among such persons, one name also comes to Self Dhirubhai Ambani.

Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, at the age of 17 in 1949, he reached the city of Eden in Yemen by a ship named Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramanikal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to the land.
In 1955, keeping 500 rupees in pocket, they reached Mumbai to try their luck.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling his sultanate.

Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was included in his cabinet while being the Chief Minister.

A security team of CRPF was stationed at my house under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are also bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Veerwar.
When the security squad was going from my house, I talked to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate this matter.

According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the tenure of Atal Vihari Vajpayee's PM, a period came when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002). Gaya.
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high 'Statue of Unity' statue in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "There was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While the records of DAVP show that the UPA has spent 30 lakhs in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements of Sardar Patel.
When asked about Modi's claims from Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari, he said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
In the UPA year 2008, Patel could not get any advertisement.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When asked about this difference from Manish Tewari, he said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of advertising or the rate of advertisement for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing it.

Proceeding through soil, rivers and forests for providing free medical care
Dr. Georges Well is delivering free health care to rural areas of Cameron
Well and his team watch hundreds of patients every weekend .
There are not many doctors in West African countries but there is only one doctor for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for someone in the top 10 or to make a hero of the CNN year.
The winner will get  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Wale had seen his sick father conscious and unconscious, going to the hospital, which was not properly convenient to assist him.
Jamel Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased which spread to his brain, and he made blood tumors, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameron."
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameron.
Instead, Vell continued to circumvent the crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and received whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy."
You leave the house at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait and die in the mouth of death.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameron has only one doctor for every 5000 people.
If compared, there is a doctor for every 413 people in United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many Cameron residents cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in health care in the country belongs to the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vell took a firm resolve to resolve this.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have undergone 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
And he launched a non-profit organization Eskovime, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped around 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them too.
They have to move forward by pushing the vehicle more than once in the rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they actually receive the honor of the heroes: feast, singing and dance, and the best housing that can be presented by the community.
Free medical care in these villages is actually a cause of celebration, and Well - with its huge smile and endless energy - it involves joy and happiness.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in each journey."
They come from the village about 60 km away, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificate - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually done at school buildings, town halls or at home, after the process, the patient walks to the recovery place, and makes a place for the next person.
The group's generator publishes the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and Vell and his volunteers work up early in the morning on Sunday.
This is a rampant speed, but the musicians of the village generally help in motivating the team.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameron doctors and foreign medical students - has done 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One person told that due to the receipt of free hernia surgery, she will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
Apart from running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Vell also works in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which funds 60 of his non-profit work, the rest of the part is fulfilled by personal donations.
In Philadelphia, a second year medical student of Draxel University and a volunteer in the group of Well, Katie O'Malie said, "I do not know when they sleep."
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medical and nursing like O'Mali, who come from United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, have this experimental opportunity, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mali said, "In surgery, we are able to get experimental experience in catching tools or cleaning blood stains for Dr. Well."
You will never get an opportunity to do this as a second year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually spend their money to reach Cameron, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching Yonde, they come to stay, and take up the expenses of instructions.
O'Mali says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Helping other people to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this job."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

By accepting this unexpected form, John Kerry has indicated that the protective attitude of the US on its monitoring program is soft that sometimes its detective goes "unappropriately".
The Minister of State has also acknowledged that he is also guilty with Barack Obama in the case of "automatic pilot" in the form of rebel disclosure towards informant Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of NSA.
This revelation has brought the US government to a diplomatic trajectory in relation to its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me and others in the government knew about some things happening with the automatic pilot, because look back, the second world war, and the difficult years of the cold war, and then, of course, it was capable in 911. "
He has become the first high-ranking member of the US government to acknowledge that US espionage has crossed its limits, but has emphasized that no one's rights have been misused.

And the President is determined to make it clear to the people and is still doing a thorough review so that no person can be misused.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee of European Affairs said that the so-called US lawmakers will go to Europe to assist in resolving concerns abroad about espionage and try to explain the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and he is worried about the threats of involvement in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
For the first time elected by the Democratic Party and Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee of European Affairs, Murphy said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that in the context of our anti-terrorist efforts, European countries should be with us. "
To clarify to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be influenced by their anger about the NSA programme.
The reports of NSA recording millions of European phone conversations have brought bitterness in relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said these reports are not entirely correct, and reflects the misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations collected by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden show that NSA has monitored cell phones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Agenla Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of spying on allies and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said that his office is arranging a Congress visit which is likely to happen this year, and he expressed hope that the delegation will include members of both the parties and both the chambers.
The names of other participants will be issued in the coming days.
He said that work is still being done on the travel program.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "practical relations" must be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, their espionage programs used for years.
Murphy said, "Though we can modify our monitoring program to protect the rights of the European people better, but they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying."
During this weekend, Mr Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address malice from US Strategy to US surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
New politics has begun to change the board in municipalities.
Recently, Trinamool's board was converted into board due to change of party councilors of Congress leadership in Saithia municipality of Birbhum district.
This change happened due to the involvement of most of the Congress councilors including the chairman of the municipality in the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councilors of CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also suppressed the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy considers it auspicious sign for the party.
They say that 10 councilors of Congress, including Saithia Municipality Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Vipalav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some councilors of the Left Front, including the CPI (M), have also taken the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the number force, the Saithia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Mr. Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join Trinamool Congress.
The deserving leaders of any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
Prior to the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of party of Congress councilors in Saithia municipality, Trinamool's occupation of the municipal board is being considered as important in political circles.
Earlier, in the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Nadia, the Congress-ruled municipal board is an example of Trinamool's occupation.
When the Trinamool is occupied due to the change of party on the municipal board in the districts, those who join the party are given a grand reception at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy is excited about breaking the other parties and joining the Trinamool.
They say that those who come out of any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
They claim that people's faith is increasing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fearing terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is considered to be a trauma on CPI (M) democracy.
Democratically, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification for making a change in the vote of power.
