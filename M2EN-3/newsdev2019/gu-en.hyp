When will you open the doors of the house for a woman in the period
My new-born Sakhi told me about two weeks ago that she was preparing for the first-third momentum.
Thirdly, there is a festival in Northern India, which is celebrated with the prayers of happy marriage.
For the third time, women are fasting all day and performing pujas at every step of the night.
While talking to me, I was very enthusiastic and happy.
On the third day, Sakhi took a new dress to wear and also put henna in her hand.
I was happy to see that, but on the morning of the third, its periods started.
After that both his mother and mother-in-law had persuaded him to fast and worship.
Other women from the house also advised me to stay away from the prayer room and asked me not to stop the prayer goods even from being wrong.
My Sakhi was also asked to stay away from other fasting women.
Entry into the Periods and Ghara Mandir
After that incident, when Sakhi spoke to me repeatedly crying, I felt as if someone had blossomed into my hair.
I came to know about the enthusiasm and preparedness of my Sakhi for the third time.
The henna mixed on the water sports activity took a look at the photography of the hand and suddenly my eyes became wet .
I told him in anger that along with the third, he had to abandon a religion that decides to enter the temple through Periyads instead of affection and charity in his heart.
Abolishing the ban on entry of women in Sabarimala Temple, the Supreme Court orders were being flashed simultaneously on TV screens on Friday morning.
What was the debate of the Sabarimala temple
Entry of women between 10 and 50 years in Sabarimala Temple, Kerala has been banned so far.
This temple, counted as one of the main pilgrimage centres of the Hindus, has been in force for hundreds of years.
Behind this distinction, the logic of the administrative system of the temple was such that Lord Ayyappa lived in the temple.
Therefore, women at the age of menstruation cannot go there and worship.
The Indian Young Lawyers Association challenged the ban on the temple by entering an appeal of public interest in the Supreme Court in 2006.
After hearing the tsunami for 12 years and hours of both parties, the Constituent Assembly of five members of the Supreme Court had submitted its repayments on 28th September, 2018.
What did the Supreme Court say
Head Justice Deepak Misra, Justice R.
Nariman, Justice AM.
The ban on entry of women in the temple was mentioned as a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution by paying tributes to Khanvilkar and Justice Chandrachud.
Khandpeeth said that no one should be allowed to worship in the temple without discrimination.
Justice Indu Malhotra, the fifth and only female Judge of the Constituent Assembly, had disagreed with the decision of the remaining four and the court paid the above fees.
The irrational dust of superstitions
My brother's face was reflected in my mind while reading about the court's payments.
Periods have started two years ago to my young friend.
He told me one day in a raging voice that when he was in Period, Dadi had refused to go to Bhagwan's room.
Besides, it is also prohibited to carry kitchens and touch the burden of pricks.
Bhatri ji had told me that on one day Mother had made me Bhavati Kadhi.
I was very hungry and I could not remember that my periods are running.
Therefore, I had gone to the kitchen to get rid of the embroidery.
Grandmother came up from Pachal and she was very angry with her mother and she asked me why so
I had no answer to his question.
My far-flung friends, the youngsters from India, who are growing up in hundreds of homes, are asking for answers from us.
The question is, the Supreme Court has lifted the ban on entry of women in Sabarimala but when will we eradicate the irrational dust of superstitions on our minds
When will we open the doors of our houses, our kitchens and our hearts for the women passing through the period
Periods or menstrual cycle is a common biological process related to reproduction in the body of women .
How can the process of creation and the creation of human beings be an abomination
If a woman is unclean for those five days of a month, then we should end such criteria of purity.
The Supreme Court can stand before us in front of the bonds of the entire world, but the question is, when will we stand on the verge of the second half of our population as a society

Revival with Alster Lambretta Club
Lambretas was an essential accomplice in the Model scene of the 1960s.
The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts from Italy's motor scooters.
About 100 scooters from all over the UK and Ireland travelled to Co Fermanagh after 70 years of the formation of the first Alster Lambretta Club at the end of this week.
Two members of the original club Packie bought one of his first lambretta in 1966, Chris Wills.
Scooter was not only a form of transportation for me but was also an option for other things to use it.
It was a little bit of sports.
I had never come to the Model View. And now I am very old for that, he said.
"Originally it was cheaper, credible in quantity and it was available at the right price and once you have it, you can do other things while riding on A to B space.
He used to race the lambratta on the Time Trial near the TT circuit on the oil of man.
The first ultra lembretta club was wiped out in the early 1990s but was revised 12 years ago.
The death toll started around 11, interest and difficulties in scooters and other transportation forms did not normally help the club, so I thought, "Bus, Finish," said Chris.
Thereafter, it showed the interest of the people a short while ago and it is expected to grow further.
Philip Steel is Member Secretary, Alster Lambretta Club, who currently holds 70 members.
Everyone has shown his or her contribution.
Looking at them, they will be influenced by the entire mode of sight, and a lot started from there.
Others are in racing scenes, in buffaloes, here is a mixture of people of all kinds.
Some people are only about ventilation.
Many scooters were customized and none of these scooters were equal.
Where can you keep it originally or roam around 35 or 40 mph, which was originally designed to go to smaller stairs of Italy but some people have tune it down.
Some of the heavy tuned bicos here can perhaps also go above 100 m . . .
At the end of the week, we had to start with some fractures and pushes.
And when the climate in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the Italian home of Lambrettta, the sun was shiny as the scooter was travelling around the County Farm.
Ruth Devidson Orders Torry Bracket Moon
Ruth Davids orders silent terms among his disciplined colleagues so that the Chief Minister can get over-breakable brackets.
Scottish Tory Leader said that there was sufficient time for discussion in the two years following the Post-Presidential Democracy of the European Union.
Teen's comments describe the Checkers Scheme of Boris Johnson as irrelevant and thoroughly incomplete.
She told BBC Scotland that it is time for the elder Prime Minister to go back.
As the Tory Workers assembled in Burmingham for their party convention, Teen said: The time has come for the discussion for the last two years.
Former Foreign Secretary was one of the greatest officers of the State while most of the schemes were being planned and appreciated in early November last year.
Now is the time for the ordinary people to go behind the Prime Minister, to give them a chance to fulfil their businesses and to give them support to serve the nation.
In the context of a silent period, I may have welcomed him warmly.
The remarks made by former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson after another intervention in the Bracket Discussion were made.
Later, Theresa May told the BBCs Andrew Marg Programme that the Checkers Scheme has the potential to provide a realistic free trade deal with the European Union and stressed that it believes in brackets.
Davids also told her that the Third Scottish will jump with the commitment of the Declaration in the coming elections to hinder freedom of public opinion as it promised the people of Scotland in 2014 that it would be the same once in a generation event.
Asked about other mandates for public opinion on any brokerage deal, Teen said: Regarding our history in Scotland, I have been repeating the fact that if you are a nationalist, you cannot reproduce public opinion because you have not achieved the desired results.
I might have been very stunned if I had said that you can revive this breakage of public opinion because the result for which I had called for was not the result.

Christine Blassey Fords Friend Brett Cavenou explains the statement on the alleged attack
Land Keyser, the high school friend of Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, who was both adolescents, accused the Supreme Court of making a specific attack on the Nominee Breat Cavenou of the Supreme Court, had written to the Senate Judiciary Committee, though he did not remember the House Party where the so-called misleading was carried out but is responsible for the same.
Keyser had earlier issued a statement by his attorney, stating that he did not remember the questioning party, and he never remembered the meeting with Cavenau.
In his speech to the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Kevinou refers to the casualty of the casualty of the casualty of the casualty of the casualty of the casualty of the casualty, but it was said that Keesar had said that he had faith in the fort.
Following a week-long delay in the entire Senate vote on the behaviour of Cavenau, President Trump suggested to the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week on Friday.
On Saturday, the Keyser told the committee in a letter through his lawyer that he was ready to fully cooperate with the FBI's supplementary investigation of the Cavenauuni FBI.
Nevertheless, as my client has already made it clear, he doesn't know Jean-Kavenou and never remembers him being in the party, nor can he remember whether he was with Dr. Ford or without.
It was also mentioned that Keyser does not pay the dues to Dr. Ford, and he has already told the press that Dr. Ford is responsible.
However, the simple and irreversible truth is that it is incapable of supporting it because there is no memory of the incident of making it, it is further stated in the letter.
A friend from Kevinau, Mark Jaz, who was present in the attack, also said that he would cooperate in the FBI investigation.

They have their own gang.
So who will believe us
The banker said.
The Joshua Tafer of the University of Chicago Defect Free Project has been replied to until recently.

CEO AB Johns was advanced to Criptocurrency, one of the most dangerous and most vulnerable wealth classes of the previous year.
A couple of years ago, I and some other senior officials were just eager to know what was going on here, especially for Bitcoin.
We started simultaneously so that we could say, We have started to understand this.
This curiosity started manufacturing bitcoins at one place in New Hampshire while the crypto price was around 180 dollars.
In December last year, when Betcoin had grown to nearly 20,000 dollars, Johns said that the price has grown and suddenly we are earning money that was never realized.
He did not mention how many bitcoins have been mine or how much the family has earned.

Currently, the group focuses more on some hurdles, he added.
He is looking at how tooknaise physical items, for example a piece of art, or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space.
But we feel that he will come back after all, said Chase.
He will be well-equipped when the facility starts.
He used the example of Pable Clock which was inadequate by the retail standards, but something that paid for the family.
The group of thirteen created an application for Smart Watch, which closed lakhs of funds through a Credit Kickstarter campaign.
When Apple Watch came to the market, the facility was ready.
He used an Apple developed for Pable to quickly come to the new product of the Apple.
We don't have a condition that Pable Watch is the next big thing. But if we have these people on our wings, we should also be there, he said.
He taught us that when the Smart Watch came to the community market, we were able to stay there.

The 63-year-old David Oldham did not remain calm despite a wooden plate grew over it by an offender.
Instead, the estate manager of the University fought, punished both the criminals and betrayed a single person.

Punishing the Ford, Jaz Clement Goldston, C said, Mr. Oldham, who had lost a punching teeth in his Ormskirk, Lancashire's 400,000 apart apartment, had given you more than necessary because when he rushed out of his house, the wire was hiding and only eyes and nose were visible, so he hit him.

While imprisoning the Ford for three years and four months, on Friday, the judge said, I hope you have learnt two lessons.
You won't gather with David Oldham. And two, you won't even gather with the police.

Tory workers attacked the conference hall and blocked them for borics.

The Hon'ble Mudra by David Davis, his case petitioners and the manner in which Boris has continued his personal aspirations is a big contradiction.
Business Secretary Grag Clarke blamed Mr. Johnson for attacking business for suspecting brakes.
Speaking about Burmingham's Tory Conference, Mr. Clarke said that Mr. Johnson's ignorance was very wrong.
He said: I was surprised that someone could think like this.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have a successful and prosperous profession.
In a meeting with the Sky News Ridge on Sunday, Mr. Davis acknowledged that the next few months would be really alarming because an attempt was made by the EU to drive a major rebate from the UK.
But he said that the Government will have to maintain its patience to emphasize the Canada-Style Agreement while checking the checkers.

Lauding the proposal of Bridge Mr. Johnson between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said, "British is one of the losers of politics.

Antonin Scalia Cavenou will not surprise much by the anti-Med Libs, says son
Fox News, son of late Associate Judge Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, told him on Sunday that thanks to the extensive power of the Supreme Court in modern life, his father, Jaz Brett Cavenau, had not suffered a paralysis against the nomination.
At the general level, he will not be surprised at the intensity of the nomination of the Supreme Court because he falls on the ROVEWED - at least the way he presents it to the right, Christopher Scalia referred to the Landmark Cases of the 13th, stating that women have constitutional rights within a specific quarter.
In one stroke, Roy stopped the States on his decision on how to effectively control abortion and several States immediately tried to curb abortion rights.
My father, Ro V. Ved, had repeatedly said that particularly in other cases, the courts were actually trying to get in and resolve the cultural issues which seemed to be resolved in the elections and in the legal process, he added.
In an attempt to short-circuit the procedure, the Supreme Court caused greater damage and consequently, the battles for the nomination and restructuring of the Supreme Court became more hot as the Justice took up the role as deemed to be.
Ben Sen, Nebraska Republican, raised the same issues during the early hearing of the clarification of Cavenau earlier this month, when he reiterated that the Congress mostly represents the authority of the unresponsive executive branch agencies and consequently leaves on the Supreme Court to effectively determine the imperative uncertainties that have been revoked by the Senators.
Capitol Hill Police had accused and arrested hundreds of opponents for unreasonably interpreting this moral action.
It was said that Cavenow had an opportunity to stay away from such negative consequences - now primarily focused on unsupported accusations that had been involved in scientific misconduct decades ago - Scalia said that this mess cannot be avoided.
Replying to the claims that Cavenau Gurudwara enquired about the critical accusations made by the Senators against him and sometimes, due to indiscriminate behaviour, Scalia suggested that the jurisdiction does not always have a peaceful mood.
Scalia, in reference to the warm hot-button cases, said that being angry for justice was not so rare.
It is true that Jaz Kavenou was perhaps more aggressive, but that was because he was different.
He used to protect his good name from unsupported allegations.
Kevinow got the approval of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday to move towards the entire Senate Flood vote through the Parti-Line 11-10 vote.
In the dramatic moments, Sen Jeff Flake, R-Ariz said that it will give only a decisive swing vote in the Cavenau party if the FBI is given a week's time to investigate the current and credible misconduct claims against Cavenau.
And President Trump has said that the agency has a comprehensive power to interview anyone he wants.
In Gujarat and other states, a case against Modi has been filed to showcase the lotus during the seventh phase of polling.
After this incident, the Congress has said that it will take this case forward.
The Congress says that if Modi wins the election from Vadodara, he is likely to go to court to terminate Modi's candidature.
After passing the case, Narendra Modi replied that the depression of the Congress is announced in this regard.

Nurses vote unbelievably on pay-deal handling
Members of the Royal College of Nursing have voted for any confidence in the organisation in accusations of misrepresentation of the expected wages by the angry members of the NHS Pay Deal.
Former General Secretary Janet Device accepted that it came after a long stories within RCN that he had wrongly told the members to increase the wages immediately after the end of the 1 wage cap.
Many of the members were disappointed without receiving the expected increase in wages, which led to the depression of the Davis members, which resulted in a vote of confidence in the Council of Colleges at an emergency meeting in Bermingham on Friday.
"Burmingham's authentic and open discussion made the air clear and consequently the college will emerge stronger," said RCN Chairman Maria Trewern.
"This vote is clear and the RCN Council and Management have received a message.
In the recent weeks, the Council has already embarked upon the institution to listen to its members more closely and incorporate them smoothly - and will continue to do so.
A meeting will be held next week and it is expected that the members of the RCN Council will return.
Nursing is based on trust, a NHS nurse told the Guardian.
The actions of the RCN Council have destroyed our faith and they have to go.
I hope that they will take honourable steps and follow their request.
I look forward to seeing whether the members of other organizations are in search of equality .
Rachel Harrison, GMB National Officer for NHS, told the Guardian in August: Over and below the country, employees of NHS have opened their salaries hacks and explained to them that they did not get as much salaries as they thought.
And they are angry.
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the RCN had accepted that it had made a lot of mistakes in the Pay Transaction and its Communications Process 2018.
However, it is stated that the RCN's Scrap the Cap Campaign had forced the government to abolish the wage cap, which was only 6. 5 along with the wages, will now be introduced in three years.
The vote came after an independent report that the presentation of the RCN deal was sidelined to its acceptance, when the deal was not imposed on Davis.
It is asserted that RCN had furnished the factual information, which means that members could not pay intimate payments on the deal, while alternative options were not scrutinized.
RCNA has published counterpart information whether all the members will get 3 increase or not.
In a separate briefing with the Congress of the RCN, the delegates were wrongly told that the 3 increase would be increased and the improvement would increase.
In fact, there is an increase of 3 and in any case, only a few top employees of their pay band will be able to increase it immediately.
A speaker from the Electronic Reform Services who carried out the report said that the information given to the members about the implementation of the deal after the Congress (probably as a result of an effort to simplify the message) was abrupt.
The ERS believes that the failure to know the decision makers, who were clearly comparisoned with the proposed deal, in comparison to the present decision, interferes with the prescribed decision as it has failed to provide a clear reference to the headline benefits of 6. 5 and 2 of the data used during the mission.
3. 4 of the RCN members passed the vote of no confidence with 8.

Would you like to come with me
Come with me, I will take care of you. Before returning to a child, he tells the family: Do you want to stay in the hotel tonight
Do you want to watch films
It will be a great pleasure to watch movies on TV or computers.
When the parents deny it, the iron erupts.
He says that you should not keep your sons on the ground, you should work hard and do whatever you can for your children so that they can lead a better life.
Someone who gives them homes and beds, give them what I do.
They'll come back to you.
I will not go from here until I take you.
Now I know who is it.
Don't fuck with me
When the family tries to escape from the iron ore, then it goes behind it. The broadcast on the Instagram Live is still going on.
Now, what is happening, they are manipulating the children, you are spoiling the Arab culture by doing this.
They are taking these children, they want to go.
Children, I am with you. Don't worry, the whole world is watching this.

Third part of Britain believes that they will never give up their gods .
Approximately 3rd part of the British believe that they will never be able to fulfil their gods in their lifetime and more than 10 of them say they will not be able to reduce their level of knowledge.

According to a report released last year by an institution of physical studies, students graduate with an average not of 46,000 and the poorest of the backward classes graduate with a loan of more than 5,000.
In fact, most of the graduates - 81 - will never pay their debt completely, which means that they will spend the first 30 years of their career on them.
Statistics from the National Statistics Office show that the home loan records in the UK are high, while the UK spends more than 700 jobs annually.
But how should we worry about this frustration of depression statistics
Is lifestyle relationship with loans normally becoming new ordinary, not just for small people but for the entire population
For example, many times after home (which we are destined to be destined) this motor vehicle is the biggest purchaser.
The auto trader warned that all new cars will be purchased on finance in a decade, as we expect to pay for our motoring changes.
Director of Ecu Investors and Chartered Financial Planner Ginny Boyle, certainly believes that there has been relative change.
God is now more ordinary - credit cards are more popular, and in the same way zero percent is called balance transfer, student loan and daily wage loan.
It was embarrassing to be a god for our grandfather's generation.
In recent times, students are generally borrowing in terms of loans and home feelings.
Moira O'Nil, head of personal financing at Interactive Investors, agrees and states that the results can be worrying.
Its not a big thing that you people are going to buy a property worth four-five times more than your income. Its not a big thing to add a little more to it.
And people will be in distress at this place.
The interest rates have been very low for many years and people with large mortgages or other debts must keep in mind that they need to be taken care of when the rate increases.
Perhaps it is understood that critics of the finance industry are trustworthy.
Chief Executive Brian Brody of Loan Agency Freedom Finance says: God is not a bad word.
Loans are no longer seen as a lesser measure for house repairs or buying new cars.
At low interest rates, many people have been motivated to lock their savings in fixed-term accounts, which pay higher rates, but have reduced savings.
Consequently, the credit for the middle class is rising.
In the last six months, half of our new loans were taken by the best credit rating consumers.
For the Richard Hames, the head of financial difficulties of the Equipment Company TD Group, this is a clear concern.
It says: Fugao reached a height of 6 months (2. percent) in August, due to the recent increase in interest rates and the increase in restricted wages, it is a matter of concern that a large number of people actually take loans without real expectation of being able to repay.
According to our analysis, this year, individual insolvency will increase by 1 and the major contributors are the record levels of subscriber credit.
God can be driven when people work and earn but for the elderly it is a matter of concern that what can be the meaning of wellness for life.
Research carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with Equity Release Expert Mor 2 Life shows that among people aged 55 to 4 years, devotion has increased by 3rd to 3rd in the last four years, which is double the national average.
And the most common form of Credit Card for the age group is 30 more than the monthly repayment.
Boyle adds: We are seeing more people using pension freedom to repay the age of 55 years, which affects their well-being in retirement.
Many times this is the only saving that has been effectively compelled to do so.
People also think that they will use equity to repay their property later but this is a problem as there is no need to always get the requisite money.
This will give a boost to the future of the property process.

A search was going on Saturday after three people lost their lives after helicopter crash in the north of Junauna, Alaska.
On Friday, one person was saved after the crash, but three others have no cards.
In the northwest of June, a helicopter crashed near Lutyya Bay.
Helicopter, who travelled long distances from the Texasana Grand Prey, was known as Airbus H125.
On Friday, 100 feet away from the shore, the planes were found to be trapped.
According to the Associated Press report, a saved person was known as 14 years old.
The survivor was diagnosed with hypothermia but the rest was alright.
When the helicopter fell down, he had two adults and two boys.
Among the missing persons, David King, 53 years old Josh Paperad, 42 years old and Andrew Paperad, 11 years old, was identified as per KTVA.
Big Paperd was also known as Head of Constructors and Engineers, a construction company at Alaska.
It is not clear what happened due to the clause.
The National Transportation Safety Board said that the investigation is in progress.
According to KTV, the Coast Garden officials in a statement stated, "Bey was on crashed helicopters with strong adults and two teenagers who were said to be completely new from the factory.

"I am a victim of sexual abuse"
On Sunday morning, President Kalien Conveyed his advisory that he had suffered from all kinds of attacks.
Convey replied to a strong exchange during the last weekend of the Supreme Court's Nominee, Jaz Brett Cavenou and Aropi, Christine Blassey Ford.
In response, Conway emotionally declared that he himself had been subjected to sexual assaults in the past and saved Cavenau for hosting Jack Taper, saying that he believed that the charges against him were preferred by caste.
I am deeply sympathetic to the victims of racial attacks and sex persecution.
I am victim of a variety of attacks, said Sunday at the CNN State of the Union Programme.
"I am not supposed to be responsible for these attacks, either Jack Taper or Jeff Flake or anybody.
You have to be responsible for your conduct.
Conway termed the network as a click to comparison with the allegations made against Cavenow, directed on the Bill Cossey, which was awarded three to ten years' imprisonment in the Pennsylvania State Jail last week.
Convey opposed the inability of the Senate Judicial Committee to remove former President Bill Clinton from office despite having oral co-existence with the Oval Office and lying about direct attacks on the American people.
Cavenau and Ford's Jubani divided America, showed voting
In America, Brett Cavenow and its complainant Aropie Christine Blassey Ford differed on the Jubani, in which Ford claims that the nominee of the Supreme Court had attacked him while both of them were young.
And the Ford or Cavenau group spoke the same number of people, out of which 38 percent of the people said that they believe that Cavenau was either possibly or indefinitely false during his youth, while 30 percent said the same thing about the Ford.
The Senate Judicial Committee heard from both sides after the Forde sent a letter to Senator Dian Fainstein giving details of its objections to the Judge.
When the letter was released, Ford and Cavenau said they would be ready to speak to the committee.
During his jubilee career, Ford said that it is 100 per cent certain that Cavenau was the same person who tried to attack him in a domestic party in the early 1980s and could be a misidentification.
In an emotional preliminary statement, 51-year-old said that he felt it was his citizen's duty to come forward.
"I am afraid," he said.
I am here because I believe it is my citizen's duty to tell you what happened to me when I was in Brett Cavenau and I was in high school.
Kevinou, who denied the allegations made by the Ford, and the two other women accused them of sexual abuse and said, "I have never attacked anyone - not in high school, not in college or at any time.
He said that there has been some suggestion - whether it is from a distance, or be it dear, it will interfere with my vote of nomination.
These are the last moments, pure and simple.
Unsurprisingly, the outcome of the U. Gov. Poll, which was carried out in a survey of 27,60 people on 2-28 September, split on the party lines, in which Democrats considered the Ford (3) and the Republic (4) as cavenou (4) more than the Democrats accepted the Republican Ford (11 per cent of 14 per cent).

President of Italy, Central Banker warns Government of Khadi Yojana
The President of Italy and the Governor of its Central Bank on Saturday cautioned that the deity of the country will be sustainable after the Lok Sabha Government announced a substantial hike in expenditure in the coming year.
At the end of Thursday, the five star movements against the Act and the ruling parties of the Left Wing League had proposed a deficit of 2019, which was 2. 4 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) three times the target of the previous government.
The announcement led to a crackdown on the markets on Friday, showing irrelevance in the cell-off and banking shares of the bonds.
It also joined the European Commission, which oversees and enforces the EU financial norms.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed a gathering of Presidents Palace which marked the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, noting that the Constitutional Law of the State requires balanced budget and continuity of credit.
Our colleagues are for the safety of the savings of the citizens, he said.
Shortly after a conference in Central Italy, Italy's Governor Ignazio Wisco's Bank said that the god of the country, 131 percent of GDP is the largest in the larger European Union economy.
According to the ANSA State News Agency, WISCO said that Italy needs to be negotiated and reduced to public and private investments.
Deva must be placed on a declining path, he added.
League Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matto Salvine also replied to Mettela that there has been an enhancement in control over the years being imposed by Brussels.
In a statement, Salvini said, Be calm, President.
In the last few years, we are changing courses and putting the future on the ballot.
Earlier, before Materla or WISCO spoke, Luigi D Myo, 5-star leader, said that the budget will compensate people for the theft of the past, yet he added that the intention of the government is not to challenge the EU or the financial markets.
The ruling parties pushed the economy Prime Minister Geovanny Trea, who is an economist, who is not associated with any group to sign their schemes to enhance the cost of deficit.
Italian media said that Meteora tried unsuccessfully to keep the GDP of Treea below 2.
The President and the Central Banker have no direct role to play in formulating economic policy.
The 20-year-old chief may deny the law and send it back to the Parliament, but he can do it only once.
Then the Parliament can pass it again, in an irreversible manner, and it is necessary to bear it in the law.
Tsunami sensors from Indonesia pass through vast waves: Official Officer
Indonesia's Geophysics Agency warned the tsunami after 34 minutes, which had killed hundreds and thousands of households after massive earthquakes on the north-east coast of Sulawesi Island.
The ruins of the car at Tsunami in Palu, Indonesia on September 2, 2018.
5 Squally Severe Cyclonic Storm and Tsunami, which was 1,500 km (40 miles) from Jakarta, killed 384 people on boards and coasts in Palu city.
Officials said that the death toll is likely to increase.
On Friday, thousands of people gathered for the beach festival at Paulu, while six meters (18 feet) high waves had passed away due to which many people lost their lives.
The Geophysics Agency (BMKG) had to face criticism on social media, in which many people raised questions about the tsunami warning that had been raised very soon.
The agency said that they followed the Standard Operating Procedure and called for finishing the warning on the basis of data available from nearest tidal sensor nearest 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
We do not have any observation data in the Governor.
Therefore, the data that was available to us was used and on the basis of this, the BMKG heads of earthquakes and tsunami centres told us.
He said that the nearest recruitment gauge, which brings about maritime change, was recorded only six centimeters (2. 5 inches) and Palu was not responsible for the nearby massive light.
We would certainly have done it if there were typical gauge or proper data in the palu.
This is something we have to evaluate for the future, said the Railways.
The officers of the tsunami who said that it was not clear before or after lifting the warning that Palu and the surrounding areas had climbed hundreds of kilometres high for an hour.
On September 2, 2018, the residents of the Tsunami in Palu, Indonesia are examining the dead body of their families.
Based on the video broadcast on social media, we estimate that the warning had been tsunami before it was officially finished, said the trustees.
The worst destruction occurred at Boxing Day in 2004, when a heavy tsunami commenced with an earthquake of 7. 5 which killed 1,26,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including 1,26,000 people in Indonesia.
The charming town of Palu is situated on the mouth of the narrow bay in north-eastern Sulawesi and has a residence of about 380,000 people.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Accident Agency (BNPB), it was launched by the Tsunami in 12 and 168.
Baptist Gombert, geologist at Oxford University, said that the tsunami created by the earthquake was amazing.
The earthquake on Friday was recorded as a strike-slip event where neighbouring tactonic plates interfere with each other, which generally produce tsunami.
He said that the AV barrier is the earthquake that caused a lot of water and a tsunami, adding that the narrow bay might have focused the socks on the edge of the sea.
Spokesperson of Disaster Agency Sutopo Puro Nugroo told reporters that when the tsunami warnings were abruptly over, their team was preparing to send public warnings.
The Ministry of Communications said that repeated warnings were sent to the residents by the Text Massage, but Nugroh said that the power and communication lines of the area were stagnated due to the earthquake and there was no siren on the coast.
Indonesians took BMKG to social media for tsunami warnings and failure to publish information in a timely manner.
However, the tsunami came... a Twitter user anogucy told BMKG in a direct message.

However, the more positive point of view was that Fleetfield was at number one in Europe last year, he knew about the Lee Golf National Course by winning French Open in 2017, and the temperament to play a big match in the US Open this year.
Moliniere is the Fresher Britain Open Champion and the most relevant speaker on European tour is widely regarded as a stricker - a symptom that has laid heavy dividends on the narrow path in search of raffs, the way most of the Americans do it, was the formula for disaster.
That dynasty, which was known as a great on-course chemistry, proved to be a forceful force.
"I feel a little emotional and we are not only Saturdays but also the well-known Fleet Wood, who has demonstrated the whole weekend with a great smile on his face.
We actually performed well this afternoon, actually played in depth and well.
It is really special to have a history together.
I am just happy that we have worked for the team.
Molinitors were equally happy.
It was amazing to play with Tommy, he said.
However, we had come up with a task, not entering the record book. We will have to fight hard for those 4-12 points that will be essential for tomorrows victory.
Night fever
Irish village transformed into Middle Age Warground
The Clear Gallery Palace in the west of Ireland, located in an English night after the fortress of one-time mighty 15th century stronghold, was on its roots on Saturday.
On September 2, 2018, the Clear Galway in Ireland is organising a night war with swords during the Middle Age War Festival at Clear Galway in Ireland.
The entirely re-established Anglo-Norman Yug Tower House had been transformed into an original middle age war because thousands of enthusiastic visitors, many people from all over the world had fought for centuries and re-enforced sports.
On September 2, 2018, during the Middle Age Conflict Festival in Galway, Ireland, in the periphery of the Carl Dorn Night and in the dress of Dona Dornon, the Clear Gallery Castle was dressed as a Saltic Warrior.
County Man's Denis Fitzgerald says that he is coming in a good weekend and that's something different, who had prepared a meal for the competitors by freeing vegetables in the ward on the campfire as the wine malik of the weekend.
"For Mara, it's like coming back to bases.
Theatre worker who attended his first Army Warrior Festival, said, I am trying my best to do everything.
In the field, soldiers used to wear dresses from nails to head in Bakhtar, when their swords were woven, some of them got stuck on the helmet and some of them cut their lips.
Others on the horseback showed their skills by cutting cabin and obergin while walking.
Nearby, metal smallers used to manufacture weapons, spice merchants used to manufacture medicines and merchants.
Some dressed in grim and excellent dresses ventured into the character.
In my view, a person can dress up but staying in the character is an art form, Helena Stackpoll said that the fashion design area of Lady Ellinor Fitzgerald has been used unprecedentedly.
"Badh Koschum is sewn on its own.
I have a bandage on which I am recruiting and it has been two years since then and the dress on which I am working today has only 800 pearls in the sleeve.
I am a little serious about this, Teni said.

FBI Contacts Nominee Cavenau's Second Appeal of Court
While examining the Nominee Breat Cavenou of the US Supreme Court, FBI agents have contacted BBI women who have accused Sexual Harassment, said his attorney on Saturday.
Deborah Ramrez's lawyer, John Clone, has stated that the FBI investigation at Cavenau will look at the various charges of rape committed by Christine Blacy Ford against the Judge of the Rudhichust Federal Appellate Court at the dramatic senate of the hearing.
Ramrez has asserted that when he became an undergraduate, he unveiled his penny in the intoxicating liquor party at Kevinau in the collective bedroom of Yale University.
US President Donald Trump bowed to the pressure of the Central Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI probe after Thursday's Senate hearing, wherein President Ford of the University of California briefs his claims that Cavenau had attempted to reconcile with him in the party in 1827 when both of them had just studied in high school.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House restricted the FBI investigation by limiting its standards.
TRUMPE twitched off the story saying, I would like them to take an interview according to their wisdom.
White House Spokesperson Raj Shah said that the FBI checks have been fixed by the Senate, which is considered to be completed in a week.
Shah said that the White House allows FBI agents to do what they have been trained for.

Europe returns Rider Cup with impressive singles exhibition
Francisco Moliere was honourably honored because on Sunday, Europe had lowered the radar cup in an effective manner, which defeated Italian File Michaelson after taking the necessary points to reach the Magic Tele 14.5.
Michaelson, along with Molivary on the green colour, had taken the hollow after firing his tea shot in the water, so that Italy became the first European to win all five matches in a week, not one of the six winners in the past.
As an Italian, when Henric Stanson and Sergey Garcia were in his sleep and assured at least half of his sports, Europe was effectively assured of victory in which Europe needed one at that point.
He called for safeguarding four and a half points out of 12 points available to revive the Trophy and to keep their pressure on the ground from the date of 1997.
It was only two times in a day-long team to win in singles - in Brooklyn in 1977 and in Miracle of Medinah in 2012, but another wonderful revival was never seen on cards.
Justin Thomas, Web Simpson and Tony Finou showed hope to the team of Jeem Furyq with the initial win, but later the entire European Points started.
Thorbjorn Oless defeated Tiger Woods in Jordan Spith and his colleague in the new John Rahe - 14 times in which the great champion had won four out of the glorious four times.

Thereafter, there was a question that the match remaining on the course will complete the next match and it will prove to be a clown who shines in the history of the incident the attractive scenes of the festival by the biggest galleries.
During his visit to Berlin by the German Coops, the name Neo-Nazi was used as a codeword while protecting Erdoan - RT World News
A pair of police officers from East Germany, who came to Berlin, used the name of a well-known extremist Neo-Nazi to work during the operation for the defence of Turkish President Erdogan, who visited Berlin.
The Criminal Police Elite in Eastern German State Sexony is questioning two members of the SEK, as stated by the Regional Inter-Ministerial Ministry.
During his expected visit to Germany, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was placed in the custody of men.
The officers needed protocols to use the codename as they were required to work undercover.
His selection was a well-known member of the UNSU - a Neo-Nazi extremist group who killed eight Turkish immigrants, a Greek citizen and a German police officer in the decade 2000.
A strange codename emerged when the two sides signed the signature of the documents issued in the local media report.
In-charge officers of the operation responded quickly, and police officers were called immediately.
Petric Clain, Chief of Sex Staff Police, was the first to respond to the news.
He said that the name 'Bohnhardt' was fortunately used in folly, and reflects the insignificant ignorance of their bonds and relationships.
Rolland Wallery, the interior minister of sex, reiterated these words as hateful, horrific and totally unacceptable.
There has been considerable controversy in Germany during Erdogan's visit to Berlin on Friday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for hosting a leader who is accused of being more authoritarian.
Merkel said that visits are very important because personal meetings are essential for solving distances.
The NSU was first brought to light in 2011 when the dead bodies of Bohnhardt and his colleagues were found inside the burnt motorhouse in East Germany.
Both of these are believed to have died in an unsuccessful bank robbery in the city of Isainac.
Beat Jesspani, the third and last surviving member of the Neo-Nazi Group, was interrupted shortly.
In July this year, the German court convicted him for committing a crime of 10 murders and sentenced him to jail.
While denying participation in the killings, the lawyer said that he is supposed to be morally guilty to failing to stop the killings.
The rubble around the NSU has led to a comprehensive criticism of the German security agencies.
Prosecutors, activists and relatives of the victims believe that the group had many more colleagues.
It is also revealed that BFV, the local intelligence agency of Germany, had placed innumerable informants in the NSU and systematically systematically tested veneering, attempted veneering, and unsuccessful group robbery.
Tasla will resign from the post of Chairperson, pays 20 million fines to the SEC
Alon Musc has resolved with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, claiming on the tweets of privatization of Tasla.
Musc will have to resign from the post of Chairman, but will maintain the position of CEOs.
According to Settlement Filing, Musk has 45 days to descend from the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tasla and is prohibited for three years in office.
It will also have to pay 20 million fines.
And because this whole thing started on Twitter, either by mistake or by intentional misleading, Musk has to get prior approval for what he has to say about the taste or posting, in any form, in which the posts on social media are included, but it is not sufficiently limited, but it is not sufficiently limited, but the website of the company (Dr. Company Block), Press Release and Investor Colles.
Tesla will have to pay more than 20 million more to settle claims that failed to treat Musc's initial tweet.
The SEC complaint had regretted the investors on the Musk with a tweet of August, stating that he had raised funds for making Tasla privatized and taking it at a price of 420 per share, which increased the company's share by more than 10.
Muskey immediately refuted his statement saying he would keep Tasla privatized and highlighted the fury of the investors.
The SEC interpreted Musc's opening words that they were misleading and misleading because there was no basis in fact.
Musc himself claims that he was an authentic mistake, wrote in a block post that he was under the impression that he had secured funds in his meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian Supreme Property Fund.
Musk and SEC were found to be close to a low sentence, which banned Musk from becoming president for two years and would not have to accept any offence, but Musky pulled back on Thursday.
Thereafter, on Friday, Tesla had fallen into the share of a shark, and he reversed his mind and adopted stringent conditions.
However, it is not necessary to accept the offence of investors misleading the new, just like the old deal.
The Head of Alexandria is pledged to support the certified Ukrainian Church, which urges conservative unity.
Alexandria's Head Theodor II has shown support for the Canonical Ukrainian persuasive church, which is a part of Moscow.
It comes with an opportunity between the Russian-based church and the constinental petroleum market.
Theodor arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on Thursday, met with high-profile delegates and outright loyalists.

Both were also asked not to argue for the prevention of Ukrainian church.
Theodor II promised that we will always be with those who love stereotype unity.
Orthodox Church has recently faced a major crises in the wake of Constantinople Petriarchy's recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian rudimentary church.
Subsequently, the Russian Orthodox Church is a constitutional component, known as Moscow Petriarchet.
The Constantinople has decided to send its excerpts to Kiva, which effectively violates the rule, in which an orthodox church is prohibited for interpretation of other churches.
Exercise Ward has special representatives who have a technically high position in the Church's Post in comparison to the Metropolitan Offrient, which is the current eldest of the Ukrainian Original church of Moscow Petriarch.
Moscow responded to the anger of the Petroleum Constantinople, stabilised the joint functioning of the member in all structures and services under the leadership or co-chair by the representatives of the Constantinople.
However, this decision was described as a criterion to further adverse measures for costantially and does not put an end to inter-disciplinary relations.

The religious movement has its own proclaimed patriarch Phillaret, who wants to be completely independent and respected for the Moscow patriarch, to secure the official status of the Orthodox Church.

Key Issues of UN Speech by Lavrov
At the UN, the Russian Foreign Prime Minister Sergey Lauroway attacked the state blackmail and brutal force of the West, and said that he should not guide the heads of state and unilateral restrictions.
Foreign Prime Minister Lauroway told the UN General Assembly on Friday that as global leaders, efforts are being made to maintain self-sustained conditions, there is no regret in pressuring some Western forces on others.
He did not mention the names of nations, but said that he uses political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force.
The world will have to pay higher prices for these golden ambitions by the small groups of countries.
Lavrov, who was Russia's ambassador to the UN for a decade, told the meeting that the place of politics culture and dialogue has been replaced by the UN's approval by a broad-based and unilateral approval.
The Minister cited the disruptions of the US decades old Cuba, where such restrictions extend to dozens of countries are illegal or inadequate.
Laurove said, But history does not teach us anything, and added that the allegations based on a very well-known highly probable object are sufficient for some Westerner equivalents to defraud anyone.
We recall that these injustice claims were used to support intervention and to encourage wars such as the Bomb Dhaka of Yugoslavia, the attack on Iraq in 2003 and during Libya in 2011.
The list of attacks under the Western leadership was not widespread as Larov describes the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest examples.
An unsuccessful attempt to eradicate governance in Damascus, which was carried out in collaboration with the militants, would have led to the degeneration of the entire country and would have guided terrorists.
Lauroway appreciated the peace process of Asthma jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, which helped prevent Islamic States (IS, pre-ISIS) and other groups from claiming Syria.
Rebuilding war-torn locations in the country and helping refugees safely return to their homes is a major priority now.
Returning to the Great Power Competition, Lauroway said that the UN was actually made out of facts on the lessons learnt from the Bija World War.
The Russian Foreign Prime Minister noted that in 2018, the 1938 commemoration of the Commemorative Monique Agreement marks 80 years, with the approval of the Nazi Connectivity of German-Provision components of Czechoslovakia in the Horizon to please France and Britain Hitler.
However, the British Chief Minister Neville Chamberlain claimed that the Munich Agreement meant peace for the United Kingdom, a year later, the war began.
Laurove said that the municipal trust shows us how far national pride and neglect of international law can go.
The colonial age should be preserved either in the ordinary manner or in the dustbin of history.
According to Lehrov, Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can reach any challenge emerging on global issues.
If you have any questions or claims, then sit up and talk, tell the truth, listen to your viewers, try to balance your interests.
Dust in the eye
What we know about Israel's vague nux is in line with BB's directive to Iran - RT World News
During the address of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Israeli chief was steadfast that Tehran possessed private nuclear locations.
Just as Israel plays a game of defamation, let's see why they have their own radioactive bones in the packet.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, brought his new manifestation on Thursday, showcasing the air photographs of Iran's sites, including the so-called atomic material.
It did not take time to respond to Tehran and said it would be better to pay attention to the non-disclosed nuclear weapons programme.
When Israel has never accepted - especially the army has not refused to have nuclear equipment, the RT's chief quote wonders if it is not the right country to tie its fingers on others.

We will talk to the courts.
Our aim is to establish that the Scottish Government used against Alex is illegal in process of grievance redressal.
Glasgow 2-13 Dragons: Doubling for Le Jones Warriors
Glasgow returned with a bonus-point victory against dragons on Scotstone in Guinness Pro14, because Coach Dave Ray expressed satisfaction but felt that his party could be more clinical.

The second tri-interval finally came two minutes after the hostages blew up the dragons line and then sent Lee Jones a clever passout, resulting in the speed.
Hastings showed its low back in front of the Post to make its transformation 12-6 during half-time.
Glasgow demonstrated the best possible start in the first minute of the second minute, as Leo Jones quickly snatched away Alex Danbar's chestker Offload into another attempt by the Hastings Extra.
However, when the warriors were arrested in Midfield four minutes later, the flight hack was followed by Dragons Centre Adam Warren, who used to score under the post, converged Josh Leise, which had earlier replaced Robson.
Warriors quickly regained sovereignty and in 54 minutes a bonus-point Fourth attempt was made because Hugh Jones had come down from the left side and shortly for the Hastings Conversion - three of its four attempts.
Glasgow remained in a comfortable stagnation and in a few minutes the fifth attempt was made because Dunber Sub Crock-Haff, George Horn was going to cruise and completed the shoe scoring of the hostings.
Cable was awarded the Man of the Match but Renie appreciated the hostings.
The coach said, "He didn't want to play with us and was flying in the middle.
He probably needed to keep a few metres deep, but he was very slippery and succeeded in finding a few places behind it.

Brient, who rejected the offer from Baltimore Revenue and is constantly connected to the Cleveland Brown, had already said that he was focused on improving himself before signing with the team.
Owens, who participated in the Prof. Boulle Holl of Fame in August and still proclaims a return to NFL, told TM that Bright's attention should go back to the field - immediately.
The Owens told the website that he goes to the team to prove to everyone the way he does it feels that he is capable.

Brient, Team Leader, had 6 interactions with 6 receptions 838 Yards and Dallas in 2017.
Carrier-Lamba has entered 23 regular sports without a 1000-yard exhibition for 2 years.
After signing a five-year Agreement in 2015, Brient has failed to record 1000 yard seasons or more than eight intermediate receptions have occurred in the season.

It is a warning that if Bryant does not get his way on the roster in the near future, it will not be done later, the Ovens said that the idea of reconnecting with the confrontational caubots should be followed.
Owens, who intervened in 38 seasons with Dels, said, "Absolutely, I don't know whether the relationship has broken or not.
"Hume Day, if Cowboys welcomed it back and got an opportunity, it would be decent for Desert and French.
