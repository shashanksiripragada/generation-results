Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
Sind on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other hand are a mixture of both in language as well .
This is called ' kachchi ' .
Though it is " dialect " , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi , you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where several earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has collapsed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jasal Toral .
The story of Jasal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same route through which we had come then we will have to take a month 's holiday and on the other hand schools will open in Bombay .
So what to do  Now the fast buses of Gujarat will be taken on a train calling it Ta-Ta .
A small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there one more small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train of broad gauge will reach Bombay from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry , which is considered to be the mainstay of the economy of Rajasthan , is passing through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia tourism business has received a deep shock .
With the point of view of tourism there has been a considerable reduction in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan among the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released recently by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics number of national tourists decreased 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008, there were a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists in Rajasthan, out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 native and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009, a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan.
These included two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 native and one million 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists.
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop even the stronger infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also a fall of 3 . 29 percent has come in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent years have passed very well for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists decreased in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing has happened new .
Desert , havelis , forts , baboons , forests everything is that old for the bait of the tourists .
In the tourism sector all governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan get very little facilities as well .
At the same time incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also blurred the image of this state at the international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism to industry in the state but it has remained confined to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism .
With the aim of promoting tourism in Rajasthan and developing tourism infrastructure , the Rajasthan Government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh with an estimated 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels could not even be filled up to forty percent .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also bringing a big loss to it .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
The attraction of tourists towards this railway could not be made .
Despite less fare it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a reduction in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the Tourist Village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no reduction in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Shahi Train .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC got a profit of Rs . 9 . 5 crore from this train .
With this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of anxiety in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a man wishes to do something in his heart , he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it to be true by setting up modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream he had dreamt of progressing day by day , his eyes reflected joy .
His joy was also seen at the time of the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work on Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been able to make its place as a fine city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been established on only 9  land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many industrialists came forward to build their own houses in this city built for millionaires and today there are about 800 families living in this city .
Initially industrialists and nobles bought their ancestry here as Holiday Home but now they have made it their first home and move to Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley itself is the Koyarigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
In the western Siang district the ruins of Likawali are very important .
Remains of a large temple are found in the excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple statues of lotus and Gods and Goddesses have been obtained which are mostly in fragmented state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this very area .
A Dussehra statue of Goddess Durga is found at this place .
Behind the name of this idol and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are singing the glorious saga of Arunachal even today .
The temple of Tamreshvari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories one gets the description of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognized far - off .
The tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Sacrifices of humans were also offered here which were later closed by Raja Gaurinath Singh .
In Lohit district of Arunachal some other parts have been found .
They are called ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are situated in the land between the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular folktales here this place is old Vidarbha itself where once kings used to rule Bhishmaka .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river which is a famous place in the Lohit district .
The Digru , Mishmi etc tribes here guide the travellers .
These people themselves also have great faith in this Kunda .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in the Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their stories .
Ghats of bathing , paved stairs and being surrounded by pavilions from all sides of another pond and getting ruins of wide roads are still singing the silence of their ancient grandeur .
From North Lakhimpur city of upper Assam through Jeep we reach ero for four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountain place captivates the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where emergency lives .
Before becoming the way of the jeep it used to take several days to reach here .
On reaching here the sights of trees of high cedar , beautiful premroses , vaolets , wild curtains , strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the tourists .
Apples and potatoes are very grown here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the emergency people .
Emergency has made it a paradise by their tireless labour .
Rice farming is very good here .
This place is a store of rice .
Ten miles long , this plateau is a living example of their hard work and skills in farming .
The Kali River meets the need for irrigation .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley four folds .
The eye falls on a slight redness rising from the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
There is a lot of coolness in the air .
One also feels moisture along with being irritated in the atmosphere .
The sound of garbage under the feet is seen on the layer of wooden boards spread on the floor .
There is dullness in the atmosphere and nothing is visible because of the dark shadow before sunrise .
Eyes start resting on the redness of the East .
I feel like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
The smooth layer of the leg bursts with the sound of a slight murmur and the hand separates from the shock with a feeling of coolness .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village based amidst these hills laden with the snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Maximum time spent in or around Geneva before this .
On both the sides of the thin Balkhati river the dense population settled in the valley is spread till quite a height on light slopes .
This is the main river Rhone of Switzerland on both the sides of which there are several small and big cities .
The parallel highway of Ron river and the crawling carts on it have begun to make it clear .
300 kms away and a two and a half hour journey by car , half way parallel to Geneva lake and half Ron river along with the Ron river coming from eastern direction near the city named Montreu Geneva lake which is called Lock lama .
100 km long and 10 km wide at the western end of this lake Geneva city is settled .
From there after becoming a river the lake moves forward towards the west .
On the right side across the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhaval , skyscraping Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we reach the mountainous path of the north leaving this highway with the exit of the left .
Because of the mountain slope being towards south the sun of Apahan is giving a lot of sunshine to the whole slope .
The amount of snow in comparison to the valley is less here - almost no equal .
As the height moves towards the height , the density of the snow has increased .
Despite good snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
The journey of approximately 20 k . . on this circular hilly road in half an hour reaches a small village named Thal .
Shailk -LRB- Halet -RRB- - large bungalows made of slopy roofs are completely wood .
The three - storeyed cement concrete basement contains power , water , lodry , etc . , for controlling essential services including parking of trains .
Valai is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of grapes making wine .
Grapes are cultivated on 37  of the entire canton .
The gardens of grapes in the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a wonderful dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wine cards bed of grapes , touring them , resting nights in the villages there and tasting wine in grapes is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aizawl built in 12th century a huge museum of grapes is there , to see which foreign tourists have to make artificial booking .
Once again we pass through the same jungle which is burnt to ashes .
The mind becomes even more distraught by the prickly questions of the children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
Suddenly a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley towards the left of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the flat slope from above the village .
Above the skiing slope the dense forest of cedar is spread up to the top of the mountain .
Dense snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlements are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
The same silence is enshrouded here also .
The kingdom of snow is all around from the top of the mountain to the valley .
Within the next five minutes we reach a roundabout in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is about 1500 .
The estimate of the number of tourists , sports and health lovers coming here can be gauged from this fact that there are 1700 apartments and shalets with a capacity of 6900 beds . 28 hotels for accommodation of 1500 , camping sites of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
So far 65 sleeps of hot water have been found in Luckerabad .
40 lakh litres ( up to 51  of per day ) of hot water is delivered to the small and big 30 thermal pools built at places in the entire town , some pools are inside five star hotels and others according to the pockets of income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the bright sunshine above the roof of the houses a thick layer of snow is shining .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the ' conserved places of national importance ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling only that Sikkim can go to Sikkim 's taxis only , hence checking is not done .
The journey is continuing , the region is different , but the mountain is same , the trees are same , the winds blowing here and there .
The moisture pouring on the whole body is the same .
In the rainy season the surmai light is the same .
As soon as the plan for the Darjeeling tour was concluded the spread of Kurseong ' s first glimpse .
Kurseong is a small town of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , whole of the forest of sunshine .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning tea gardens smile and greet those moving towards us .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side a green mountain full of forests , on the other side a deep green trench .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
All around was the empire of greenery .
Once upon a time I got scared , looking at these natural jungles or the tea planted by man .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The more beautiful the forest was the tea garden spread far and wide .
When we glanced at the streets of the road then it seemed marvellous .
The curved and curved path was passing by the snake .
Time was also passing .
No , the forest and tea gardens weren ' t going on .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From a distance a hilly house looked very dense .
It was a curse .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
First of all Dear Parks .
A small garden surrounded by huge forests .
To reach up to the deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Kurseong , despite being beautified with beauty , has not yet developed into a tourist destination .
However , the city is quite nice and clean .
Despite the passage being desolate the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the way between the trees of sunshine was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of British lovers used to jump from here and give life .
At present it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a ladder like dome here on observing the entire city from the height of which a beautiful scene is present .
In the tea garden nearby , the women were eager to break the tea - leaves with basket loaded on their backs at a very fast speed .
There is a museum outside Kursiang city , but that day we could not go there , because touring the free environment of tea gardens seemed necessary .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was an exciting experience in itself , but it was a big concern as to how would we roam around in the same way when it rained .
But coincidence was very good that on reaching the rock garden we enjoyed the blooming sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming .
On moving a little more than here Gangamaya was found surrounded by hills .
Here amidst rocks the illusion of waterfalls is made to be seen .
We found in rock gardens that if waterfalls are spectacular in the empire of stones and rocks then the magnificent world of streams in Ganga - Maya is adorned with stones .
Both these places are located very low in the midst of the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Baisia Loop in Darjeeling rising above the vehicle .
The whole of Darjeeling hill and city can be seen from here with the help of telescopes .
The mood of the weather was still nice .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , from where did we come down and began to glitter .
There was a plan of strolling and shopping in the evening on the malrode .
In the tour of Darjeeling Twi trains put four moonlights on the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and the journey from Dhoom to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Here boating in Mirik Lake and comfort in gardens .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters etc are found from Nepali artisans .
There is also arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its colors are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , rather there is movement of forests - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling to visit Darjeeling in the shade of coolness , but the tea garden spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling has tied me with itself .
My recent small journey has been very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither from a foreign country nor from outside Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing in itself in which the journey sometimes draws towards itself , sometimes it is a special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people get pulled .
The place I am going to talk about has been prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation the place with which this place has come here has really turned into a forest .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears , my guide Ram Babu resonates with the words of Meena , Sahiba , we could not even imagine before that we could live like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent of the staff is from this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not even get work at the Heritage Hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbgarh , used to work in Jaipur before and now in this unique royal style , Aman Bagh .
He has turned his own speech into a new colour .
Sahiba ' is an estimate of Aman Bagh .
There no one calls you from English tone .
Aman Bagh is truly a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to nearby areas also .
How many of the people who had spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have visited Bhangarh in the ghosts  Why should I go away  Some among the Jaipurites would probably have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there very carefully but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had wandered on his way to Bhangarh .
This time suddenly when I arrived at the banquet of my foreign guest then I felt that those people who want to spend a wonderful holiday in less time they must go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp to hunt .
It was constructed in nineteen , hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is a testimony to those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Garden charms you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed you will get to know that divine peace has been taken care of here .
In the wrist , the mantra of Mangalachar is pronounced lively along with the tying of a mauli .
We had reached the slope in the evening and intended to set up a garden .
My host Jackie , who was decorated , suddenly said , It ' s interesting .
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
It is n't surprising that Aman Bagh got the award recently but artistic ' everything new .
The manager decided our programme for the morning .
First of all , a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey to Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow roads we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
It did not rain this year but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie , such a glimpse of rural life was unique .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are millions of dollars precious .
Aman Bagh ' s way of saying goodbye was also traditional , he bid us farewell by feeding jaggery and curd .
Now we came to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also put up to show Tribal Life .
Is that right
Of course not one such state happens in many states and tourists also show great interest in them .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , eating etc .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places , where there has not been much development and time has not had much effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Alongside , where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides , serving a traditional key is also taken into consideration .
Actually the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists comfortable with the lifestyle and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
The bus tour has its own fun .
You can enjoy roaming alone despite being with a lot of people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without disturbing .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with spending less time and giving you enough time these tours definitely keep demanding for patience .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is necessary to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign destinations by bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc get discounts on these , then there remains an arrangement of discount for two people as well .
Though it is cheap to buy tickets in advance therefore it is better to plan a tour in the last moments than to do a plan .
Find out about round trip instead of two tickets .
These are cheaper .
Rules regarding baggage are very strict therefore inquire about the size and weight of the luggage .
Sometimes it does not happen that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you have to pay the extra fee .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags remain right , lets go .
Because they fits in the rack above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage will be yours .
From where you have to take a bus you reach there an hour before time .
During the busy season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually the sooner you reach , the better seat option you will have .
While choosing the seat take care of the comfort .
If there will be more shocks in the previous seat , reading on the front seats will not be comfortable .
If you have to go to Loon again and again , then take a seat in the corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it ' s a clever thing .
If both of you are about to grab , then sit on the seat already at the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while chewing seat , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out during the cleaning of the bus .
During this do not leave your luggage in the seat , because on its disappearance the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time you can get a new passenger in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome had not been seen in Europe , he had not seen anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its stuff .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those oldest cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its impression is seen on western civilization .
Rome settled on the Taibar river is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion because the residence of the main ' Pope ' of this religion is in Rome itself .
The ancient Rome was settled on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , a circular wall was built around it .
Its remains can still be seen around Rome .
Rome is famous all over the world for ancient buildings and their remains .
This city with luxurious palace , grand church , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keeps you magical to hypnotise at first glance .
This huge and unmatched building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy Victor Emmanuel II started building in 1885 and it was completed in 1911 .
Infront of this is the idol of Emperor Emmanuel 's horse riding which took 20 years to build .
Here in the first world war unknown soldiers were buried .
The carvings of this monument and the victory symbols made on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you are interested in art works , then you must see them .
Along with the monument is not only of Rome but also of Italy 's magnificent and grand square ' Piazza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this chowk is as famous as Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this , Piyatsa de Spagna ' is also very popular among the tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying  Piazza Venezia ' you must also go to the famous road of Rome i . . Via Del Course ' .
Large shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the grandeur of this road four folds .
Significantly this road is the main road of Rome .
This unique building is built on ' Capitoline Hill ' and is located at quite a height .
Famous sculptor Michael Angelo had built the stairs to climb on it in 1536 .
There is a brass statue of Emperor Marcus Orelius riding on a horse in front of Capitoline which ruled Rome from 160 - 180 AD .
This magnificent statue will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on Capitalline is also a different identity of this building .
There is also a church , museum and old temple in Capitaline Complex .
The symbol of Rome is colossium .
This huge arena was constructed in 80 AD and 50 thousand spectators could sit together here .
In colosseum gladiator or sword makers used to show their feats .
They fought not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These terrible battles , whether from other swords or animals , continued until one of the fighters died .
In ancient Rome there used to be many ' forums ' .
Lets say that mixing places are called forums in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political and other activities of the city used to take place .
Among these the most famous forum was Roman and the remains of the palaces , temples and pillars are present even today at this place .
Indeed , by looking at them one gets an idea of the magnificence of ancient Rome .
Pathiyan : This marvellous ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
In the middle of its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
Because of this place the devotees felt as if their prayers are reaching directly to the gods .
Statues of deities are made all around inside the temple .
Incidentally this temple was made a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome but Village Borgis is unparalleled .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
You must go to the museum built here because on missing it you will miss the opportunity of being face to face with the best sculpture .
The idols built here are unique and look so lively that they will just speak .
Here the sister of Napoleon I , Polyne whose marriage took place in the Borgian royal family , an idol lying on its bed appears so lively that you will not be able to stay without seeing it lonely for a while .
The special attractions of Rome are its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevy Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come to Rome again , he should put a coin in the fountain with this desire .
It is believed that by doing so the desire gets fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not complete until you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since the sixth century this place has been the residence of the supreme religious chief ' Pope ' of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church of Vatican City , St . Peter 's Square , fountains , museums etc .
Of course they will show you a different world view and will always give you a memorable experience .

After that if you stay in Male you can still find hotels in less fare but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then your pocket will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis cruise has still postponed its services but it is expected to start again from October .
You can go on a trip to Maldives for a cruise of three days at a rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person per night on the ship of Louis cruise M . . .
That is the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two adults are adults , children below 15 years of age are absolutely free .
and what else .
The cruise rent includes tea , breakfast , food , all .
Each time entertainment is done together .
After reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a plane emerges in front of you while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But with 12 - 15 seats this Tiwan Oter Plane is unquestionably good for touring Maldives like Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it does not come to know .
You do not have the experience of flying ordinary airplanes throughout the flight .
Each time your eyesight stays below the window watching resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clearly everything looks .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Tross Maldives is one of them with 20 C planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire plane on rent for your entire day -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
By the way if you go to an island beyond Male island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that might never end up with you .
Sea Plane runs from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavelivaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovereign shop of the capital in Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All salesmen were listening to the speeches given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the presidents or the prime minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unsurpassed creation of this earth , it was inevitable .
Many people might have thought the meeting held by the Maldives cabinet inside the water in October , but on going to Maldives it feels as if the wrath of nature snatched it from us then how poor the world will be .
There is something special in its beauty .
In that tiny country it was not as beautiful as this .
Returning from that tour of the market towards its cruise , when the eyes went towards the jetty , barren road along with the water of the sea , it felt as if the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that in the light of the lamppost the fish floating in a depth of several metres was visible with all their colors .
It was that part of the sea which was very adjacent to the city .
If you can clearly see a few centimeters in the sea or river water adjacent to any city of India then you will find yourself lucky .
While returning to M . V . Aquamarin , spent two hours in the garland were roaming around in the evening .
Coral reef -LRB- dumb rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find muga rocks on the stones attached to the tombs .
Just a while before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not certain that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security guard far and wide .
We were enjoying taking photographs of gardens and verandahs merely fifty metres away by spreading our hand inside through the door of his bungalow .
Can you think so about the leader ' s house in India from an adventure
It came to be known that president sometimes crossing the roads on foot only reaches his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about the Maldives was overwhelming .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It was a blame that the day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of the Maldives by rotating around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the mall then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
of the pictures that I saw .
But then there was no guess that the next day there would be a chance to ride .
We were about to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the Sea Plane of Traus Maldives .
Watching the hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives was unforgettable by the sea plane flying till the height of approximately thousands of meters .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling and breathing flight .
But on reaching the conrad resort of Hilton Hotel on Rangali island it feels as if we have reached some other world .
in a world that had nothing to do with any outside world .
It was not so much that it was difficult to get the beauty or luxury out there .
A walk can take place on the conrad or by a battery driven car .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was marvellous .
We were unable to make ourselves easier by the nature around , reaching such a place , unimaginable .
Climbing down several metres below the stairs in the water of the sea we reached into such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Across all the sides we could see people doing unique types of fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating and drinking on the decorated tables there was extremely thrilling in itself .
The fare for sighting and underwater lunch on this island from Male to Sea Plane is Rs . 47 , 000 for a man .
I had no intention of returning from there .
We were willing to wash our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart they returned with the hope that sometimes , at some point of time the fate would be brought here .
We had been planning to leave Delhi for several days but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Since childhood had the hobby of wildlife then thought why not go to gym carbet this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking from Khardungla pass to Pegong lake .
In the early morning of 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog emerged from the zeal that came out of our midst .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Fog above and bad road in front .
Sometimes it seemed that he fell down .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , whose booking we had done earlier .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to visit the banks of Kosi earlier .
After spending two - three hours we went out to the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult 2 kms away near Dhangri Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if a lion roaming free in the jungle looks like a lion then in a dream I kept on seeing it all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night I heard a sudden roar and after that the dogs who started barking did not stop for two hours .
So first came the suggestion of roaming black and carbet fall .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres away , while Carbet falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
It was twelve in the afternoon .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this garden only .
On reaching the resort safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for sighting in the number one site , Bijrani there .
On asking about number one we told that there is more grassland and during this time tigers come towards the same side to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees to roam around four hours .
We went inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , whose long teeth were .
I did a lot of photography .
In the meanwhile the guide started tracking Tiger .
Guide told that there are only around 150 tigers in the park out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of his claws , but I was depressed not to see Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind , Tiger ' s fittoor was riding .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I telephoned him like that .
I told him that I had come to Carbet .
He asked if he saw Tiger or not .
His words pierced like an arrow .
I said softly , No .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a safari for the inside .
