The tourism department which is considered the main foundation of the economic situation of Rajasthan , is going through bad governance at this time .
Due to the emergence of huge accidents in Vaishali and South Asia , the tourism industry faces severe obstacles .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan with the point of view of tourism has become very less during these days .
According to the recent surveys by the Rajasthan government in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is less than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
After taking a dinner the number of tourists in the country decreased by 98 . percent and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
Together with 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand and 918 were included and 14 lakh 77 thousand and 646 foreign tourists were included because between 2009 there were 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 tourists in Rajasthan .
Among these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand and 691 people of the country and 10 lakh 73 thousand and 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourism department think about this situation very well .
The director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanchay Kaushik has said that terrible events like Vaishik Mandir affect the tourism industry badly .
In comparison with other countries of Asia we do not develop the firmness and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India maximum number of tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attraction of tourism has kept on increasing year after year in Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan decreased .
From the point of view of tourism there is nothing new .
Deserts , large palaces , forts , wells , forests all are old , to make the travellers wonderful .
In the tourist places every government goes on doing work in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing is done in this direction .
Travellers coming to Rajasthan get very less facilities .
At the same time along with foreign ladies and tourists in Rajasthan the recent times due to rape and aggravation this country 's picture has been painted internationally .
Years prior to the Rajasthan government there was a stir in the tourism department of the country but it was shrunk in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is one such example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the purpose of enhancing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of lodging , food , lodging , boating etc to the tourists .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight Kafatiyas , three dharamshalas , one pocket concentration and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the situation of this office has been deteriorating for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 is estimated to be 185 lakh and 63 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this institute is that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels having 40 square metres have not been filled .
Along with hotels other units of hotels also play a significant role in it .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Passengers do not get attracted towards this train .
Because of less rent also it does not attract tourists .
In such a situation in the time of Pushkar Fair also the wishes of travellers get lessened .
In 2007 - 08 this fair was organised by RTDC in the tourist village where 398 foreign tourists stayed , this year its number has reduced to 217 .
Among all this the pleasant thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of the attraction of Palace on Hills and Shahi Trains .
This train is continuously beneficial .
Last year RTDC earned a profit of nine crore rupees from this train .
Due to this fall occurring in the tourist spots of Rajasthan it is natural to see doubts on the tourist spots .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economic status of Rajasthan .
But if you feel like doing something in the minds of people then they produce gold from the soil .

Going to the area with grape gardens , traveling there , resting at night in the villages there and going to the factories of grapes and examining the wine , all these are the total area of the tourism industry here .
There is a huge collection of grapes in a small town named Aizawl built in the 12th century for which foreign tourists book beforehand .
Once our people crossed that deserted forest once more with wild boars .
Throughout the way of three - four kilometres the mind of the children gets disturbed with the frozen questions .
Suddenly a dramatic and beautiful change takes place from a curved view .
Just nearby on the left side of the road in the upper part of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is standing .
On the upper level of the villages people ski on the snow .
Above the skiing slope the dense forest of cedar is spread till the peaks of the mountain .
Snow falls from all four sides .
The roofs of houses shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reached the village .
Here also the same silence takes place .
All around there is a confluence of beautiful snow from the peak of the mountain to the valley .
In the next five minutes we reach a big round between that small city .

It is said in Darjeeling that Sikkim ' s taxis are the only ones that do not get tested .
The journey continued , the area was different , but the mountain was same .
It is the cold which keeps the whole body shivering .
The color of rainy season is also mine .
When the plan of Darjeeling was fixed then at first we decided to see the sight of Karsiyang .
Carziang is a small town in Darjeeling.
Full of tea gardens and dense forests are full of dense forests .
It is famous for the production of excellent tea .
On climbing from Siligudi to Darjeeling in the beginning tea gardens smile and welcome the people coming there .
While passing through the middle of the tea gardens the first time it hypnotises heart .
On one side full of forests and green mountains on the other side deep green grass .
If there is forest in the middle here then tea gardens can be seen in between .
There is a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once even I got confused , do I see these natural jungles or the tea planted by humans
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness the more beautiful is the tea garden .
If eyes go on the roads then creation is marvellous .
We crossed through a serpentine , narrow and circular way .
Time also passes .
Forest and tea gardens are not finished .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
One gets to see a lot of concentration on houses and buildings in a mountain from afar .
This is Carzyang .
Staying at one place here we prepared a program of roaming throughout the day .
Meaning taking a vehicle we proceeded to Carsyang .
First of all, Dear Park.
A small garden is surrounded by dense forests all around .
One has to climb up and down to reach the deer park .
With the point of view of being surrounded by the beauty of Karsiyanka it has not been able to develop in the form of a tourist spot even today .
Because the city is so clean and clean .
The wish to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles in the background of the road blooms and the joy of climbing amidst the trees of sun gives us the adventure .
The nearest place is Igal Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is called Suicide Point .
During the British period lovers used to go to enjoy from here .
Hilhal is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a fort here with a stairs on which beautiful views can be seen from above while reviewing the entire city .
In the nearby Tea Garden women sit on a big pocket outside and drown the leaves of tea with their hands very fast .
There is a museum outside the city but that day we did not go there because it was necessary to travel in the open environment of the tea gardens .
Next day we decided to go to Darjeeling .
This was an adventurous experience for me , but if it was raining then we were thinking a lot about how we would be roaming .
But coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we got up and roamed around enjoying the fun of sun .
This garden is a beautiful place rich with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful .
When we descended a little from here then we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst the rocks the illusion of waterfalls can be seen .
In Rock Garden if the waterfalls of the rocky empire gets shining then one gets to see the wonderful world of waterfalls in the Ganges getting decorated with stones .
Both these places are located very low in the midst of the mountains of Darjeeling .
In Darjeeling we saw an unforgettable sight while climbing upwards with the help of a vehicle .
From here along with the help of distant darshan the whole of Darjeeling can be seen .
The weather remains clear till now .
But when we climbed the monastery we saw the clouds standing there .
Evening gets shining and shining from somewhere .
Toy Trains also enjoy travel in the journey of Darjeeling .
Travellers from Darjeeling to Dhum , Dhoom to Darjeeling are particularly attractive .
There is boating in Mirik lake and some rest in the garden .
On this way tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazaar , where sweaters and handicrafts of Nepalese artists are available .
There is an arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because this is the residence of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegram which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we did n't go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for roaming in Darjeeling in the shadow of winter but the tea gardens spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling have made me reach forever .
In my condition a small journey is very interesting and thrilling .
This journey is not in foreign countries but outside Rajasthan because it is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me , in which the attraction of any tour takes place , but at times some special place is the ship of water or some royal train or some city of pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people are attracted .
The place which you had to do , that was prepared about four and a half years back , but along with those preparations this place came here and in fact they really got angry .
It is not just for the people going there because it is also for the people living there .
In my ears the sound of my guide Ram Babu Meena was sounding , before this we did n't think how we were staying in the jungle .
Fifty percent workers are also from this area .
Suddenly -LRB- suddenly -RRB- I felt that such people do not have the job of staying in Heritage Hotel at all the places .
Ajabagadh resident Raman Babu had worked in Jaipur before this very time in this unique Amber garden .
He tells himself that he has changed a new color .
Master  Amman is impressed with the garden .
There no one will call you under the influence of English .
Aman Garden is actually a center of excitement , peace and at the same time with all kinds of conveniences .
The garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that its introduction is through the nearby areas .
How many people traveled to Amber pavilion of Rajasthan from those who spent their holidays , why should they go far , some people spend the night in this area from Jaipur residents .
After the opening of Amal National Park large number of people from all over the world come here .
Shahbana Asmi called me there very lovingly but I did not go , that night I remember .
Its work has been different which has reached to Dangarh via its own way .
This time I arrived at the invitation of unexpectedly our foreign guests , but those people felt as if they had spent a special holiday in some time , where the park must be visited .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens , where the king of Alwar made a camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in ten and twentieth .
Its ancient walls are witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and is a witness of strong trees .
The way you come inside you welcome you in the same way as if you have taken care of the supernatural peace here .
Along with tying rope in Manikarn the mantra of Mangalore should be kept alive .
We arrived at Ladakh in the evening and made a plan to visit this garden .
My guest Jackie enjoys being an ornamental lover and a guy .
All are inspired by big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
All of these are new , artistic and no wonder that Amal park has got the status of architecture at this time .
The manager prepared our program in the morning .
First of all a pedestrian journey with Ram Babu and then a jeep safari of Dangarh .
While walking on the way to Sankari we saw the fort of Ajbagh in which the rays of the sun spread gradually .
On seeing the dry lake farmers are cultivating it .
This year there was no rain , but firstly we saw tobacco cultivation .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackal is a unique experience .
After that we reached Danag in a jeep .
In the morning I kept watching a traveller in Holland with great care .
Millennium dollars are invaluable moments for this .
The way of saluting the journey of Amman garden is tradition and by giving jaggery and curd it was told us by them only .
Now we got to know why tourists are coming here spending so much .
I have heard that there are picnics to see the life of tribals also .
Is this true
Beshak is not so much , there are many countries and tourists are particularly interesting in it .
This tour usually takes place from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are included in other places .
Where to stay in it , food etc . are included .
This way attempts are made to explore such places , where there is not much development and there is no effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots and slopes .
Besides this traditional cooking also takes care of .
Actually the meaning of such a tour is to make the tourists understand the customs and traditions of living in that area .
Although it is a bit difficult to imagine but this type of tourism is a charming and different kind of experience .
It 's a different fun altogether going on the bus .
You can enjoy roaming alone because of staying with people in it .
Nevertheless in this journey if you take your favorite book then you will get more time in getting disturbed .
Yes , it is important that along with giving less and more comfortable moments this journey definitely requires tolerance from you .
To enjoy this keep in mind some things specially if you are watching by some foreign destination bus tour .
Find out if there is a good deal before taking ticket .
Students , army officers , kids etc . get benefit from this but other people also get a discount .
Though there is arrangement for ticket in advance therefore in the last minute planning for roaming in the bus is good but planning should be done in less time .
Though there is arrangement for ticket in advance therefore in the last minute planning for roaming in the bus is good but planning should be done in less time .
This is expensive .
The routine to pick up the bagget is also very hard , hence talk about the size and weight of the luggage .
Sometimes it does not happen that you have to leave some of your things in the terminal or else you have to pay more money .
Together with this the information regarding insurance and loss from tour company should be known .
Carry on bags should be kept minutely and should be taken out .
Because there is squeezing in the rake at the top of the seat .
It should also be kept in mind that while doing bus between tourists the responsibility of the luggage will be on its own .
Wherever you want to board the bus , reach there an hour before .
During sneezing you should keep in mind this thing .
Actually the sooner you reach , the better you will have to choose a place with you .
While choosing the place keep in mind if there is a cover .
There is more lump in the back seat but reading while sitting at the previous places is not a caffewable .
If you want to enjoy the warm air often then you can sit on your side and if you do n't want to be more disturbed then this place at the end will be better for you .
Then intelligence is a matter of skill .
If you are thinking of getting both of you together then sitting on the front side keep a bag on your seat .
If you are thinking of getting both of you together then sitting on the front side keep a bag on your seat .
If there is too much busyness in the bus then plans are successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
While cleaning the bus everyone asks to go out .
At this time do not leave your luggage in the place because when it disappears those people in the bus will not take the responsibility of it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
But if you do not come on time then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After that if you stay on a hill then a hotel will be available at a lesser rate but if you go to any island outside to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be reduced .
Sea journey is useful here .
In the first week of December , Louis cruise is the only ship from Kochi to Maldives Colombo .
Louis cruise is not only the European organization but is also important for cruise and hotel business .
But because of some difficulties Louis cruise has kept on stopping its services but possibility of resumption starts again from October .
At the lowest rate of the ship of Louis cruise you can go to the edge of Maldives with a cost of at least 5850 rupees per person per night for three days .
That is the expense of one person for three days is less than 18 , 000 rupees .
And if you are two people then the child above the age of 15 years is totally beneficial .
What else do you want
In the expense of the cruise tea and snacks are included .
And for the entire time laughter .
After reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the adventurous activities and activities available in Maldives according to the size of pockets - from the journey of sea plane to the lunch in the waters .
If an airplane comes in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But the 12 - 15 seats Tivanam Oter plane like Maldives is excellent in the form of tourism in an unusual way .
The speed boat runs on the surface of the water which flies in the air , can not be known .
In every flight you do not feel like an ordinary plane .
Your perspective will always be below the window - different parts of Maldives will be seen blue water , resort islands and coral islands .
Everything is clearly visible.
There are two main airlines in Maldives .
Trans is one of the islands in Maldives which has 20C flights .
If you want then you can take a flight of around Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or you can rent the entire flight for an entire day -LRB- if you have a pocket of money -RRB- .
If you are going to any island from Maldives to any other island then for air travel it is necessary that you travel by different islands this is the best way .
You will never feel like stopping this journey .
C - Airplane runs from 12 k . . to 183 k . . in Maldives .
We were in the biggest ancient and grand shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
All the people taking the luggage in the market were carefully trying to do the linguistic explanation done by President Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference held in Rapan Gan a day earlier .
Frankly I have not seen any Indian either President or Prime Minister listening to him so carefully .
But it would be better to ignore the suppression of the existence of a creature living in an unconscious state of this land .
Many people call the convention underwater through the Maldives cabinet in October as Totak , but when going to Maldives it feels that if nature takes it away from us then how poor the earth will be .
There is also a speciality in the beauty there .
This much of beauty can not be engraved in that small country .
To go back to your cruise from that edge of the market one can get to know how much people understand this beauty .
Due to the water being so clean the fish swimming very deep under the coal light can be seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
If you are able to see a few kilometres of fresh water in the sea or river related to any city of India then it will be impossible .
The evening spent two hours in the garland after returning to Aqua Marine was not clear .
Coral reefs are the life here .
Here you will find coral reefs on tombs and on stones above .
We stayed outside his office some time back to hear the language of President Nasheed .
We could not believe that we were ahead of the houses of the noblest person of a country .
With a lot of interest we took a picture of the garden and garden around 50 metres by pulling it through the door of his bungalow .
You can think this in front of the house of any leader in India .
It has been learned that President sometimes traveling on foot he goes to his office at the other side of the road .
Everything related to Maldives was moving towards one side .
That is why I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning cruise took us to the airport .
From there we reached the place named Trams Maldives by rail route .
Last evening while reaching the cruise mall we boarded the airplane running above .
Several pictures of it were seen .
But we did n't know that it was possible to travel in the next decade .
We had to go to Rangoli island at a distance of 105 k . . by train and TV .
It is an unforgettable sight to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread on the seashore of Maldives by a flight of about 100 metres above the sea level .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
It was a journey of suffocation with thrill and passion .
But when we came to the Rangoli resort of the Hillton Hotels of Rangoli Island then we felt as if we have come to a different world .
A world that doesn't have any connection with the outside world.
There was also anxiety about such beauty , luxury and such beauty which could be found anywhere outside .
Travelling in Konark can be done on foot or in a car running in a battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jatti to Main Island was miraculous .
Now we had reached at the place where we could endure ourselves from the external nature which was beyond thinking .
Climbing down in the water a few metres below the sea with the help of stairs we reached a mirror room in the middle of the water .
That room was actually a lunch room .
On every side small and big fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving , etc . were also seen .
The thrill of having your meals while sitting on the decorated tables over there makes us enjoyable .
The cost of the person coming here by flight to this island and eating lunch under water is Rs . 47,000 .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to throw our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
If you have a heavy hearted destiny then you have returned with the belief that something can come here again .
For some days a plan was made to get out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Because of an excitement in wild life since childhood why should not this time go to Jim Corbett
This is the second bike tour in Ladakh after cycling till Pegong lake in front of Cardungla pass in 2006 .
On the morning of 27th December we set out from Delhi on the goal of Jim Corbett , but the joy with which you set out , mud ice blocked our journey .
The journey between Hapur and Gajauda was difficult .
Snow from the top , snow from the top , and rod from the front .
Often I felt as if I had fallen .
In one way we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We arrived at Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in dikuli near our resort park and booking for that was done before us .
There was no particular program but despite being cold we went walking on the edge of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to the Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
It was late at night when we returned .
As soon as I arrived from Delhi I certainly saw a lion roaming in the jungle and lions surrounding me in the dreams of the whole night .
In the midst of the depth of the night I suddenly heard a loud roar and after that till 2 o'clock the dogs kept shut .
The first opinion was to visit Kalbhangi or Corbett waterfalls .
Kalbhangi is 30 kms away while Corbett is on the way to the waterfall .
In the museum of Korbat Sahib in Kalbhangi many things related to his life have been preserved .
It's 12.30 p.m. when I came back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has begun to reach this village .
When we reached the resort safari gypsy was knocking at us .
He had arranged for sighting at the best bijarani there .
When asked about number one , it was said that because of the excess of grass there the leopard had come here to save it from the cold .
As soon as we reached Bijrani, we gave us a guidance.
We prepared for the jungle inside .
We prepared for the jungle inside .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants, whose horns were very big.
I took a lot of pictures .
The guiding light started to find the tiger's path.
The guide said that in the park there are around 150 tigers in which some of them had died recently .
At some places we saw the marks of their nails but because they were not visible we were sad .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I thought the entire tiger was riding .
Then I remembered an old friend of mine in Haldan .
I just called him.
I told him I was in Corbett.
He asked me if I could see the tiger or not .
His words were astonished .
I said softly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike in the park.
Somebody advised me to take a ride inside.
