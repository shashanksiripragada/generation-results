The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near the Panchar .
The story of Jessel-Toral is very interesting .
The way through which we came back that way itself we have to take a month 's holiday and where the church opens in Bombay .
So what to do  Now for the rush buses of Gujarat one has to travel by train .

The tourism department which is believed to be the main cornerstone of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad governance at this time .
There is a huge obstacle in the perimeter industry in Vaishno Devi and South Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan with the point of view of tourism is almost less in these days .
According to a recent survey done by the Rajasthan government , the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is less than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
As a result there was a decrease of 98 . percent in the number of tourists in the country and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 together in Rajasthan 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 are included , and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists are included , because in 2009 together 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourism come to know of this situation very well .
The director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that incidents like the Vaishali temple have a bad effect on the tourism industry .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to last year there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in the number of foreign tourists coming to India .
Maximum number of foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
In the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists in France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The concentration of tourism keeps on improving Rajasthan year after year .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , large palaces , forts , wells , forests , all these are old , to surprise the travellers .
For the purpose of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the tourist places all governments keep getting down and down but do not do anything in this direction .
Travellers coming to Rajasthan get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent times in the incidents of abduction and outrage the picture of this country has been illustrated on an international level .
Years before the government of Rajasthan the tourism department of the country got disturbed , but it started shrinking in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of developing the basic architecture of tourism and tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
Facilities of accommodation , food , pockets , boating etc . are available for the tourists .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 cafteria , three pathways , one pocket coin and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the condition of this hotel is deteriorating for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008-09 is estimated to be 185 lakh and it is estimated to be 63 lakh in the year 2009-10 .
The condition of hotels of these hotels are such that in the last five years the rooms of their hotels are not filled even in fourty square kilometres .
Along with hotels other lodges of hotels , which are a big loss .
Among these the main ones are the Royal Rajasthan of the Hills .
Tourists do not get attracted towards this train .
Because of less rent this does not attract tourists .
In such a situation one also gets to see the fascination of the passengers towards the Pushkar Fair .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair in the form of RTDC there were 398 foreign tourists staying in the tourist area and this year its number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the joyous thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction for tourists on Palace on Hills and Shahi Train .
This train is continuously profitable .
Last year from this train RTDC earned nine crore rupees .
It is natural to see the alarms of doubt in the tourist spots coming to the tourist spots of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economic situation of Rajasthan .
But if the desire to do something in the minds of men is felt then they make gold from the soil .

There is silence all around , we could not see much because of the dull light coming out before sunrise .
Eyes went towards the eastern Arunima .

In a small town named Egypt there is a huge collection of grapes in a fort made in 12th century , to see which foreign tourists are booking beforehand .
Once again our people crossed that deserted forest with forests .
The heart gets restless by the question of the rolling of children all the way up to three - four kilometers .
Suddenly with a curved scene a dramatic and beautiful change is made .
Actually on the left side of the road in the upper area of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses keep established .

It is said in Darjeeling that Sikkim 's taxis go only in Sikkim therefore the test is not possible .

It is the cold that makes the whole body shivering .
The black color of the rainy season is also on me .
When the plan for Darjeeling safari was fixed then for the first time we decided to see the sight of Karsingh .
Carsiang is a small town in Darjeeling.
The tea gardens are full of dense forests .
It is famous for the production of excellent tea .
On reaching Darjeeling from Siligudi in the beginning the smiling tea gardens welcome the people coming here .
On crossing the road between the tea gardens the heart gets enchanted for the first time , and is one of the places conserved in the form of a treasure .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a deep green pit .
If there is a forest in the middle then a tea garden can be seen in the middle .
There is a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once upon a time I got worried whether these natural jungles were visible or whether they were grazing tea planted by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful is the jungle , the more expansive is the tea garden .
If you look at the roads on the way then the creation starts spectacular .
We crossed a narrow and circular road in the shape of a serpent .
Time also passes by .
Forests and tea gardens do not finish .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
From a distance on a mountain one gets to see very comfortable with houses and buildings .
It's Carciang.
Staying at a place here we prepared a program to visit all day .
That is , taking a vehicle for departing in Carsiang .
First of all, Dear Park.
A small garden is surrounded by large forests on all four sides .
Climbing up and downstairs the vehicle to reach to the deer park is very low .
With the point of view of being rich with the beauty of Carcia it has not yet been known as the tourist spot .
Because the city is so clean and clean .
The desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles in the wake of the departure of the road and the joy of climbing the path between the trees of the sun give us the courage .
The next place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called suicidal point .
In the period of the British the sages used to stay here .
Hilhall , this is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase here , on the top of which beautiful scenes can be seen from the whole of the city .
In the tea gardens nearby women come out in the large intestine and suck the tea leaves with their hands in a hurry .
There is a museum outside the Carizong city but that day we did not go there because it was very important to travel in the open ambience of tea gardens .
The next day we decided to go to Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience for me , but if it had rained then how would it have been that we had thought more about walking .
But the coincidence was very good that when we reached Rock Garden we enjoyed the fun of the sun rising .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
As we descended a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks a flow of waterfalls can be seen .
In Rock Garden , if we are glittering with the waterfalls of rocks and rocks in the kingdom then we can see the magnificent splendor of waterfalls in Ganga .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing upwards with the help of a vehicle we saw unprecedented scenes in Darjeeling .
The whole of the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of spectacles .
The condition of weather is clear till today .
But when we climbed on the monastery we could see the clouds standing .
Evening can be experienced and shining from anywhere .
In the journey to Darjeeling Tawai train is also enjoyable .
From Darjeeling to Dhum , from Dhoom to Darjeeling the journey of Tawai train especially attracts the tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and some rest in the garden are found .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on the way , where sweaters and handicrafts of Nepal are found .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is abundance of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegram which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we did n't go to Kalimpong this time .
If we had come to Darjeeling from Calcutta then to roam Darjeeling in the shadow of winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here connected me to itself .
In my situation a small journey is very interesting and thrilling .
This journey is not outside Rajasthan but outside Rajasthan because it is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject for me , in which some travel has attracted me , but sometimes some special places like water ships or some royal train or some other flights like Gulab city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted towards it due to some special attraction .
The place where we went to do , that was prepared four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place came here , that is why they really mesmerize .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears the voice of my guide Ram Babu was shouting , we did n't even think about it before how we were living in the jungle .
Five percent workers are also of this area .
Suddenly I felt that people of such a place do not have to work in the heritage hotel .
The inhabitants of Ajabagarh Ram Babu had earlier worked in Jaipur , now this unique Amber palace is in the Amman garden .
He said to himself that he had changed a new color.
Master ' is the influence of Aman Garden .
There no one will call you English administrator .
Aman Garden is actually a center of peace , comfort and happiness .
The garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that its introduction is through the nearby landscapes .
How many people from the people spending holidays in Amra Prayag of Rajasthan traveled to Dunag , why did they go far , some people from Jaipur residents sometimes spend nights in this area .
After the opening of the Amal garden large people of the country and abroad reach there .
Shabana Azmi called me there very lovingly but I didn't go that night.
Its songs are different that they can reach Danag by wandering on their own .
This time I arrived at the invitation of our foreign guests hosting in an unexpected manner , but those people who spent some time spending a miraculous holiday feeling like , there you must go to the Aman Garden .
This garden is a lonely garden protected from those seven gardens where the king of Alawar settled for hunting .
Its construction took place in tenth and twentieth .
Its old walls are the witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and is witness to strong trees .
The way you come in , that way welcomes you , from that it feels that you have taken care of the peace here .
Along with closing the cloth on the bell blanket the mantra of Mangalacharya should be kept actively .
We arrived at Ladakh in the evening and planned to make a trip to this garden .
My guest Jackie becomes a lover of decoration and a lover of music .
Everything is inspired by big buildings and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
All new and artistic amazements are not found in Amal park at present .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Danag .
While walking on the way to Sankari we saw the fort of Ajabagh in which the rays of sun spread gradually .
On seeing the dry lake farmers do farming in it .
This year it was not rains but for the first time tobacco was found .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackie is a unique experience .
After that we reached Dhang in the jeep .
In the morning I kept looking at a tourist from Holland very carefully .
This is a moment of invaluable price of millennium dollars .
The way to salute the Ammon garden is traditional , he told us to leave with jaggery and curd .
Now we got to know why tourists had come here spending so much .
I have heard that there are picnics to see the life of tribals .
Is this true
Basket is not that kind of , it is in many countries and tourists are particularly interested in it .
This tour is generally ordinarily ready from four days to two weeks and in the middle of this tourists get included in different places .
In this food and beverages are included from wherever you want .
In such places attempts are made to explore such places where excessive development does not take place and where time does not affect the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots also .
Besides this it also keeps in mind the distribution of traditional cuisines .
Actually the meaning of such tourism is to make the tourists understand the ways and ways of living in that area .
Although it is a bit difficult to imagine but such a tourist spot is beautiful and a different kind of experience .
It 's a fun to go on a bus trip .
In these many people stay with you because you enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , on this journey if you take a book of your choice then you will get more time when you are disturbed .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less and more comfortable moments this tour will definitely ask for tolerance from you .
For enjoying this keep in mind some things especially if you are watching any foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking a ticket check whether it is a good deal .
Students , elders of the army , children etc get benefit from it but they also get relief from it for other people .
Although there is arrangement for taking tickets in advance therefore at the last minute it is very good to plan tours on the bus but plan is to do it a little early .
Although there is arrangement for taking tickets in advance therefore at the last minute it is very good to plan tours on the bus but plan is to do it a little early .
This is expensive .
The daily routine taking the bagge is very hard , therefore tell about the size and weight of the goods .
Sometimes it is not like this that you have to leave some of your things in the terminal or you have to pay more money later .
Also keep in mind the rules of giving insurance or compensation for loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags should be kept carefully and should be taken out .
Because there is a throbbing in the rock on the top of the place .
Also keep in mind that while doing bus service the responsibility of the goods is at its peak .
From wherever you want to board the bus you can reach there an hour before .
During the period of smelling you will have to keep an eye on this thing .
Actually the sooner you reach the better place to choose will be with you .
It should be kept in mind that while choosing place the cuffer is there .
The swelling occurs more in the back side while sitting in front , reading at sitting places is not a cafartable .
If you want warmth often then take a place on the sides but do not like to disturb too much then sit on the edge of the edge is the best for you .
So one thing of intelligence skills .
If you are both inclined towards the thinking then first sit on the place and sit on the bag .
If you are both inclined towards the thinking then first sit on the place and sit on the bag .
If the bus is more busy then the plan is successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information from them .
Everybody wants to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your things on sitting , because if they disappear then the bus do not take responsibility for this .
Whenever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come in time then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

In the first week of December from Cochin Louis Cruise island is the only ship in Colombo .
Louis cruise is not only a European institution but also an important name for cruise and hotel business .
But because of some difficulties Louis cruise has stopped its services but there remains a chance of its resumption from October .
At the lowest rate of the ship of Louis Cruise you can go to the edge of Maldives for at least 5850 rupees per person for three days every night .
Meaning for three days the expense of a person is less than Rs . 18 , 000 .
Not only this , if you are two people then this is the best example for a child below the age of 15 years .
What else do you want
In the cost of cruise tea - breakfast is included .
And full time sports.
On reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the fun and frolic accumulated on the Maldives according to the size of the pocket - from sea plane ride to lunch below the water .
After roaming around in big airplanes you will feel that if a plane comes in front of you suddenly then it will be a toy .
But the twelve - fifteen seats Tiwan Airport is excellent in an unprecedented way for roaming in an island group like Maldives .
When it starts flying in the air like a speedboat on the surface of water , it can not be known .
On every flight you will not feel like normal flights .
Your policies are always underneath the windows - on the various sides of the Maldives in blue water on the resort islands and coral islands .
Everything looks very clear.
There are two flight companies in Maldives .
Transplant is one of the islands of Maldives , which has 20C flights .
If you want you can travel by plane for hours in around Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- or you can hire the entire airplane for the entire day -LRB- if you have full money -RRB- .
If you are going to any other island from Maldives then it is necessary for aeroplanes to travel in different islands .
This journey will never stop you .
C - Airport runs from 12 kms to 183 kms in Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and grand shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
All the people taking luggage at the shop were very carefully informed by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed about the language of the world climate conference held in Raepon Gun one day earlier .
Frankly speaking , I have not seen a Hindustani , either the president or the chief minister , listening to the language so carefully .
But it is better to observe silence on being a question of the bone marrow of one remaining creation of this earth .
Many people call the convention happening inside water by the Maldives cabinet in October , but when we go to Maldives it feels as if nature ' s wrath is suppressing it from us then how impoverished is the earth .
There is a speciality of its beauty .
So much beauty can not be enjoyed in that small country .
To return from that shore of the market to your cruise do not turn in front of your cruise .
The water is so clean that under the bright light the deep swimming fish can be seen with their own colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
You will be surprised to see a few kilometres of fresh water in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India .
After returning to Marine the M . . . Aqua had spent two hours in the evening in Mala .
The corals are the life here .
Here you will find cotton buds up to the rocks on the tombs .
To listen to the language of President Nasheed some time back we were outside his office .
We could not believe that we were in front of the house of a nation 's best personality .
With great interest , we took a picture of gardens and anganbari simultaneously 50 metres wide through the doors of his bungalow .
You can imagine this before any leader 's house in India .
It has been understood that the president sometimes goes to his office two blocks beyond the road on foot .
Everything related to Maldives was moving towards one side .
That is why I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning the cruise took us to the airport .
From there we reached the place called Maldives by roaming through the railways .
Last evening while reaching the cruise mall we headed towards the C-Airplane from the top suddenly .
Many of its pictures have been seen .
But we did n't know how to travel in the next minute .
We had to go to Rangoli island 105 kilometres away by train , Mall , TV .
Seeing hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives by the C-Airplane flying at a height of approximately 100 metres is an unforgettable sight .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
Due to excitement and excitement breathing stops .
But when we got up at the Rangoli resort of the Hilton Hotel of Rangoli Island it felt as if we had reached a different world .
There's another world that has nothing to do with the outside world.
There was anxiety of such beauty , luxury and whether it would be found anywhere outside .
Travelling in Konark is possible on foot and in cars running in battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going to the main island from Jatti was marvellous .
Now we reached the place where we could endure ourselves by the natural beauty nearby , which was even beyond imagination .
We reached a mirror beneath the water just a few metres below the sea with the help of stairs .
That room was actually a bathroom .
On all sides we saw small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling , scuba diving etched in the middle of the glass .
It 's adventurous to think of eating and drinking while sitting on the decorated table there .
The expense of a person reaching this island by flight from Mala is 47,000 rupees for seeing and taking lunch under water .
He did n't feel like coming back from there .
We were ready to drop our passport in the water .
But I knew it wasn't possible.
If there is a fate with a heavy heart then something can come back here again .
A few days back a plan was made to go out of Delhi but due to busy schedule this was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife was an excitement , why should not this time go to Jim Corbett
In 2006 in Laddakh after bicycling till Pegong lake in front of cardamom glass this is the second bike tour .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Delhi with the goal of Jim Correspondent , but from what Joshkhath had departed , we had to cover our journey with snow .
The journey between Hapur and Gajauda was comfortable .
The snow covered from the top and the rod that hit the front.
Several times it feels like falling .
In a way we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in the Dikuli near our resort park , we had booked it earlier .
It did n't have any particular program but despite it being cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett Museum .
From there we went to Ramnagar downstairs .
On returning nights were very late .
While coming from Delhi definitely watching the lions roaming around in the jungle and in the dreams of the whole night there were lions all around me .
In the middle of the depth of the night I suddenly heard acute roar and after that I kept on dogs for 2 at night without stopping .
The first opinion was that Kalbhangi or Corbett waterfall was to be visited .
Kaalbhangi is 30 kilometres away but Corbett is on the way to waterfalls .
Several items related to his life have been preserved in the Corbett Saheb museum of Kalabhumgi .
It's 12.30 p.m. when we get back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has begun to reach this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
He used to arrange sighting facilities in the upper market there .
Asked about the first number , because of the excessive grass there , the herds came here to protect them from the cold .
We gave us a guide when we arrived at Bijarani.
We prepared for the jungle inside .
We prepared for the jungle inside .
Inside, we saw two tusker elephants, their horns were very big.
I took a lot of pictures .
The Tigers began to guide us.
The guide said that there are only about 150 tigers in the park , some of them are dead recently .
At many places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sad because they could not see them .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my thought the entire tiger was riding .
Then I remembered an old friend of mine in Haldwani .
I just called him.
I told you I was in Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see a tiger or not .
These words of his fell down like a weapon .
I said it slowly, no
There was no permission to get a bike in the park.
Someone advised me to take a ride in.
