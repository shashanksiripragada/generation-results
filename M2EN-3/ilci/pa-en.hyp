Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhi on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
Though it is ' Boli ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then you have to write it in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that anjar city where several times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has been devastated .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jessel Torl is very interesting .
If we return from the path from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's holiday and at the same time we will have to open schools in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now telling the fast buses of Gujarat to to tower we will take a journey of the train .
A small train of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train towards meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
Considering the main base of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism industry is passing through bad times these days .
Due to commercial recession and due to the increasing threat of terrorism in South Asia the tourism industry has been shocked deeply .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan settled in the major states of the country has decreased during these days .
Statistics released recently by the Rajasthan Government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of domestic tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are particularly concerned about this situation .
Rajput gradually the director of Makers Sanjay Kaushik says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even been able to develop the strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
From the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan .
After 2008 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forests everything is that old for enjoyment of tourists .
In the area of tourism the matter of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism does increase by all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time in recent years incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign palace tourists have also registered the image of this state at an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the achievements of the Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of inviting tourism and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation makes available facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motorways , 8 cafeteria , three travellers , one passenger unit and two Train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained narrow for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the deficiency of RTDC has been 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009-10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that even in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also bringing it a big loss .
Among these the main are the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attracted towards this train .
Despite reducing the fares this could not attract tourists .
This way in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village made by RTDC this number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Rail Rocks .
This railway is continuously bringing benefits .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this deterioration in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his heart then he can produce gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled it by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadri in Maharashtra .
The sound which he saw that while waking up day after day , his eyes rejoiced .
His joy was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in building its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread in more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city made for crores of rupees and are living almost in this city today .
Initially industrialists and residents bought their residence here in the form of holiday homes but now they have made it their first home and here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this region .
The verandahs of Leekawali in the western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the excavation of the idols of Kamala and Goddesses is enough which is in a state mostly ruined .
Malini Thaan is an important place in this very area .
On this spot a decorated idol of Devi Durga is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many melodious stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devpalli are still singing the glorious tale of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient tales the description of the Mahama of Tamreshwari goddess is found .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north-eastern mountains this goddess was recognized far and wide .
The tribal people here used to worship the goddess .
Human sacrifices were offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some more ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the midst of the Dibang and Dwang rivers .
According to the stories published here this place is very old , where once king Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tribal tribes like Digru , Minakhi etc . guide the tourists here .
These people themselves have great respect for this kunda .
Near Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Dwang - Wali district are also of very historical importance .
The relics of the lake of bricks near Roing are still telling their stories .
Lack of bathing , surrounded by polished stairs and other ponds on all four sides and the relics of wide roads are still ignoring its ancient legend .
We reach ero from four hours through jeep from the Northern Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
This pleasant mountain place at a height of approximately 4500 feet hypnotises the hearts of visitors .
This is that charming place where climate stays .
It takes several days for the jeep to reach here before it forms the road .
On reaching here the views of high - high cedar trees , beautiful Premrose , Volatet , Wild Current , Strawberries and Rosberries enjoy .
Apples and spinaches are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometers .
This beautiful valley is the residence of immigrants .
With its untiring hard work the untouched people have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is the reservoir of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of agriculture .
Its irrigation gets fulfilled with Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley four folds .
In the middle of the snow laden chains of the left hand there is a slight redness emanating in the sky on the white surface .
Best cough in air is cold .
Along with the chilling cold in the environment one also gets the feeling of moisture .
With the sound of litter below the legs one gets to see the lining of the ladder spread on the floor of wood .
There is a humidity in the environment and much is not visible because of the blurredness before sunrise .
Thickness remains on redness of vision .
One feels like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the bed shines with the sound of a mild wrist and the hand separates with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneva or nearby .
On both the sides of the narrow Balkhanda river dense population settled in the valley is spread very high on the slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rohn valley on both the sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the vehicles roaming on it have begun to clear .
At a distance of 300 kms and a journey of two and a half hours from the car the Jeneva lake coming from the east side along the Jeneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the east side meets the Jeneva lake near the city named Montro which is called Lock Lames -LRB- Lock Lames -RRB- .
Geneva city is located at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke on the left side we leave this highway and come to the northern side on the mountainous path .
Due to the slopes of the mountain being south -- west the Sun of the Criminals has been giving abundant sunshine to all the birds .
As compared to the valley the amount of snow is less here - approximately not .
While moving towards the height of the living , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good cough on both the sides of the road being frozen with snow there is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of approximately 20 k . . on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thele .
Stones are slopy , completely wooden , large and enormous bunglows .
In the basement made from the cement concrete tower of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , lodge etc . along with parking of vehicles .
Valley is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes of grapes .
37 percent land of the entire cantonment is the cultivation of grapes .
The gardens of grapes in the villages located on both sides of the Ron Valley provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking out the orchards of grapes , touring them , taking rest in the night in the villages there and enjoying alcohol in the grapes of grapes is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small town named Agai there is a very big museum of grapefruits in a clock made in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to make an adventurous booking .
Once again we crossed the same jungle while descending from Dawal .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the sneezing questions of children going three - four kms on the way .
Perhaps on a turn a dramatic and charming change comes in the sight .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the top of a deep valley a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on spectacular slopes from above the village .
Above the skiing slope on the peak of the mountain a dense jungle of Makdev is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the colonies are sparkling because of the sun 's direct rays .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also silence is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley the empire of the Dhawal Himalayas .
Within the next five minutes we reach a large round chakra from the center of that town .
The name of the colony is Lukarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukurabad is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 1800 hotels for staying in Shoulay , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 sips of hot water have been found till now in Lukorabad .
40 lakh litres out of these everyday in the hot 510 water is provided in the whole of the town in approximately 30 small and big thermal pools , some pools are inside the five star hotels and according to the pockets of people coming from different classes .
On reaching the village one feels very hot .
In the open sunshine above the roof of the house a thick sheet of snow is sparkling .
The name of Albenin is of this village .
Albenin village is one of the protected places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only be a technique of Sikkim hence there is no checking .
The journey is on , the area is on , but the mountain is there , the trees and plants are there , the simple winds are there .
The moisture present on the whole body is the same .
There is a rhythmic light in the season of rains .
The plan for the journey of Darjeeling is fixed , first of all the decision was taken for the glimpse of Karsyang .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , complete with the jungles of sunlight .
Famous for producing excellent tea .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siligudi then in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the people moving towards it while roaming around Mussoorie .
The lure of a road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side is a green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side is Hagiri valley .
At times the jungles here and there used to be tea gardens .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I got upset , see these natural jungles or plants of tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful was the jungle the more beautiful was the tea gardens spread far .
If you look on the road on the way then it feels very strange .
The hustle-bustle and bustle of the snake was passing through .
Time was also passing .
If it was not past , then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes a small settlement is visible .
From a distance a hill appeared very dense from houses and houses .
This was Karsyang .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming the whole day .
That is why we set out on a tour of Karsyang taking a train .
The first deer park .
A small garden surrounded by large forests on all four sides .
To reach the upper climb i . . deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being immensely rich with the beauty of Karsyang the development of this place has not been done well in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very good and clean .
Despite the path being deserted the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and roaming amidst smoke trees was giving us the joy of roaming .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by attacking here .
For the moment , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a straight pocket here , from whose height a beautiful view of the whole city is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea gardens running by the hand at extreme speed wearing a bowl on their backs .
There is a museum outside Karsong city , but that day we could not go there , because touring the free environment of tea gardens became more necessary .
Next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was an adventurous experience in itself , but it was very worried that how would we roam as soon as it continued .
The coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we roamed around taking the pleasure of the open sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant than this .
On moving a little more below from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The view of waterfalls amidst rocks here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that if waterfalls are present in the empire of rocks then the miracle of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is worldwide covered with stones .
Both of these places are present very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw loops waking up on the basis of train in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescope the whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The mood of the weather was still frozen .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we decrease and start glittering .
Planning for strolling and shopping was made in the evening .
In the tour of Darjeeling tower trains put four moons in the journey .
The towai train journey from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and Alviram in the garden .
From this route travellers also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepali artisans are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but there is a stream of forest - waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot and Lolegaon , which is surrounded by jungle waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata .
My recent small journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor outside Rajasthan , but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like a pink city or lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of this a special attraction people start pulling .
The place where I am going to talk , this bus has been prepared approximately four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come here , that has really turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide Rambabu Meena resonates in my ears , sir , we could not even imagine before this that we could stay here in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that these local people did not get work in the heritage hotel as well .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in this tomb earlier in Jaipur and now in this unique royal style Amn Bagh .
He has given a new color to speak his own words .
Saheb ' is the prediction of the Amn Bagh .
Nobody tells you English words there .
Ammon garden is really a place with immense peace and all the facilities .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it will engage you in the areas nearby .
In the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people had toured Bhangarh of the past , why would they go away , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchh would probably have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of the Amman garden big people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there heartily but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh by traversing the way .
This time suddenly I reached there on the request of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a wonderful holiday in less time they should definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to run to hunt .
Its construction was done in the nineteenth century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Garden in the shade of mountains surrounded and dense trees will hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it seems that here divine peace has been paid attention .
Along with the binding of garland in wrist the mantra of Mangalacharan is lively pronounced .
We had reached the top in the evening and decided to set up a cycle of that garden .
Whatever sounds like my magnificence , my colleague said , this is interesting ' .
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Is everything new and artistic no wonder that Amn Bagh has got a recent prize as well .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a circular road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which peasants were cultivating .
This year it was not rainy season but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For this such a glimpse of the rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from Jeep .
In the morning and evening I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar precious moment .
The way to say the alumni of Amn Bagh was also traditional , he left for us after feeding jaggery and curd .
Now we understood that why tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing tributary life .
Is it right .
Otherwise this is not the case in many states and tourists also show coughing interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time travellers are taken to a different place .
In this staying there , food etc are also included .
This way there is an attempt to explore such a place where there is not much development and where there is no specific effect of time on nature and the lifestyle of people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing a tridental cuisine survey .
Actually , the aim of such tours is to make the tourists realize the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
Despite this being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book many times without being distorted .
Yes , it is necessary that along with giving less expenditure and a lot of time for peace these tours definitely keep a demand of surprising people .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior men of military , children etc get a discount on them , then there is arrangement of discount for both people also .
However , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to do the bus tour in the last minute that planning is done a little before .
Instead of towing tickets come to know about round trip .
It happens to be cheap .
The rules regarding bagge are particularly tight , therefore ask about the size and weight of the commodities .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your belongings on the terminal or you have to fill the extra percentage .
Also enquire about insurance or compensation for damages from tour company .
Carry on bags are right , lets go .
Because they come in the race above the seat .
Also keep in mind that during the tour while changing the bus the number of luggage will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , from there you reach an hour before .
During the Big Season you should take special care of this matter .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat operation will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the comfort .
If you feel more jerky at the back seat then it is not comfortable to read at the front seat .
If you have to go to Lou again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more distorted , then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now there is talk of a driver .
If you go to the back of both the arms , then sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then there will be planning .
If there is facility of vasroom in the bus then while chewing the seat also keep this thing in mind , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because if it is lost the bus do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops go back on time .
If you do not come in time , then you can find a new passenger in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is contiguous with its beautiful sea shores and diverse water bodies which is a heavenly glimpse for the travellers , where with the tour of ancient churches one gets to see the beauty of ancient times very easily .
Situated in the capital of Goa Panchim Ginger Hotel excells the journey of the western coast .
Ginger hotel located here is an excellent option to spend a comfortable day enjoying fully enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea cruise and world famous Goan food .
If seen on today 's date then for Maldives the cheapest person returns from Delhi is Rs . 28 , 000 .
After that if you stay in Malaysia even then you can get hotels on a little less rent but if you go on some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Sea creams prove beneficial here only .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started the single cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .

Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has already adjusted its services , but it is expected that it will be revived from October .

What else should you want .
Tea , breakfast , food all are included in the cruise fares .
Every time the entertainment of beauty is gathered .
After reaching the capital Malaysia you can enjoy the beauty of the beauty , activities available in Maldives in accordance with your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming around in the big airplane suddenly gets in front of you a sea plane then you will feel like a toy .
But this tissue of 12 - 15 seats is unique for roaming Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of water this time when it gets up in the air , it does not come to know .
In the entire flight you do not have the experience of flying ordinary airplanes .
Every time your sights keep looking down on the islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them with a twentieth plane .
If you want you can travel by air for an hour in approximately Rs . 1000 -LRB- per person -RRB- or the whole sea plane can be rented on a daily basis -LRB- condition is pocket filled -RRB- .
If you go beyond Malay Island on an island then a sea plane journey will be necessary because this is a mode of travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which may never let you feel like finishing .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometers to 183 kilometers -LRB- in Umma -RRB- on the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenir shops of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
All the sailors were listening very carefully to the address given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
Saying honestly , no Indian could see the President or the Prime Minister listening carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth then such seriousness was imperative .
Many people might have understood the meeting happening inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October but might well have gone to Maldives but if the wrath of nature loses it then how much will the world be
There is something special in its beauty .
In that small country it seems that such beauty does not encompass .
Returning from that tour of the market to go on its cruise while returning towards the jetty , when the eyes went in the waters of the sea along with the beauty of Brussels then we realized that how far people here understand the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of lamppost many fishes lying in deep depths were seen clearly with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you see some centimetres also clean in sea or river water connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself dry .
While returning to M . . . amorphous 2 hours of the evening spent in the mall were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- pearl rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones attached to the tombs you will find rocks of pearls .
Just before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
We did n't believe that the housing of the best personality of any country was ahead , there was no security work till far .
Interestingly we were taking photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty metres away by placing our hands inside the gate of its bungalow .
That you can think of such a leader 's house in India .
It was also known that the President sometimes crossed the road on foot and reached his office two blocks ahead .
Everything was surprising about Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day very carefully .
It seemed as if the day was going to be special .
In the morning from Cruise a boat took us to airport island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the cycle of the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the mall , we immediately recognized the plane passing by .
So many pictures that he had seen were hiss .
But then it was not known that next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were going to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away .
Watching the hundreds of lakes and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately a thousand metres was amazing .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling flight of thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Connaught Place of the Hillton Hotels on the Rangli island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world whose external world was not residing anywhere .
The architecture was not such that it was difficult to get out the beauty or architecture there .
Tour on Konark can be done on foot as well or by a battery operated car .
On both the sides of the bridge while going till the main island from the jetty the view of hydroelectricity was unique .
Now we could not even comfort ourselves with the surrounding nature , it was time to reach such a place .
While descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
All around crossing glasses we could see unique kinds of small fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating and drinking on decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch in this island in sea plane from Malaysia is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to dwell in our passport water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart beat you back with this hope that you will surely bring ' A ' on some turn .
They were planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to arrangement of evening this was not possible .
When wildlife was sleeping since childhood then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour after the biking of Ladakh from Khardungla Pass in 2006 till Pagong Lake .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal with which we had come out , Core circumscribed our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Kora from top and dirty roads in front .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there Corbett museum came out , which was near Dhangi Gate very difficult 2 kms away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It became quite evening while returning .
The lion would definitely see the lions roaming free in the jungle and I kept looking at the lions all night in a dream .
Amidst the depths of the night suddenly I heard a tremendous storm and after that the dogs who began to bark , they did not remain silent for two hours .
From the point of view , suggestions of touring Kaladungi and Corbett Falls came first .
Kaladungi is 30 kms away while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi , where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
It was twelve and a half past twelve while returning .
Kaladangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come and settled in this village .
On reaching Paris the safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they got the arrangement of skiing done in the number one seater journal there .
Asked about number one , Grasland is more there and Tigers come towards it only to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two towers of elephant , which had long teeth .
I got the photography done after roaming .
In the meantime the guide started trekking on the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of them have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad to see that the tiger was not visible .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a fountain of tigers in my brain .
Only then did I remember one of my old friends of Talchani .
I took him the phone in the same way .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
Whether she saw the tiger or not .
His words kissed like arrows .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone suggested us that you should take a safari for inside .
During the journey we came to know that because of being a busy highway near the park often animals get either injured or die by fighting with vehicles .
