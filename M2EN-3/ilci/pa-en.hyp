Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
As such it is ' bidding ' , it does not have its own script .
If you have to write Kutchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where several times earthquakes have come and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the monument of Jasal Toral .
The story of Jasal Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same route through which we had come then we will have to take another one month holiday and on the other hand schools will open in Mumbai .
What to do  Now you will travel by train calling the fast buses of Gujarat a toa .
A small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there a small train towards metre gauge will reach Ahmadabad and a big train to broad gauge will reach Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
These days the tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan has been passing through the bushes .
Due to trade recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia tourism has reached a deep impression .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been registered as cough during these days .
The recent figures released by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics number of national tourists decreased by 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 only 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism sector are very concerned about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajput gradually makers says that vicious recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to last year the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
For Rajasthan from the point of view of tourism the recent years have been the best .
After 2008 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , forests everything is that old for the tourists to graze .
Rural tourism in the area of tourism , working on the name of medical tourism , adventure tourism all the governments multiply but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign palace travellers incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan have also glimpsed the image of this state at international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism to a botany in the state but it has remained limited to only seven decades .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two trains , Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has been thin for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the deficit of RTDC was 180 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels have not been filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also reaching its destination .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This rail has not been able to become an attraction of the tourists .
Despite decreasing fare this could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years a dearth of tourists has been seen in Pushkar Fair also .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the village travellers made by RTDC there this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Train .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC got a profit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the stories of anxiety in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If you want to do something in the heart of man then he can produce gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it to be true by setting up modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had seen , progressing day by day , rejoicing in his eyes .
His pleasure was also visible during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as a wonderful city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available on only 9  land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many industrialists come forward to build their own houses in this city built for crores of people and today almost every family is living in this city .
In the beginning industrialists and rhinoceros bought their homes in the form of holiday homes but now they have made it their first home and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this region .
The ruins of Leekawali in the western Siyang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the idols of Kamal and Goddesses are very excavated which are mostly in dilapidated condition .
Malini Than is an important place in this very region .
On this spot a Dussehra statue of Devi Durga is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are popular among the residents here .
The ruins of Devpali are singing the glorious saga of Arunachal even today .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories one gets the description of the architecture of Tamraswari Devi .
During the time of Chetiya kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess had a distant identity .
The tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Sacrifices of humans used to go here which was later shut down by King Gaurinath Singh .
In the Lohit district of Arunachal some more ruins have been found .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak city which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Divang rivers here .
According to the famous stories here this place is old Vidarbha itself where once King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmkund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
The desert , mini etc tribes here guide the tourists .
These people themselves also have great faith in this Kunda .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in the Diwang- Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of the brick pond near Roing are still telling their stories .
Ghats of bathing , surrounded by pucca stairs and one more pond all around getting the remains of wide roads are still singing the silence of its ancient grand story .
We reach ero from four hours by jeep from Northern Lakhimpur city of upper Assam .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where peasants live .
It takes many days to reach here before the jeep is made road .
On reaching here the views of trees of high deodar , beautiful premrose , wild curtains , strawberries and raceberries overwhelm the visitors .
Apple and apricot are very rich here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the colonial people .
With its untiring efforts the people of the vicinity have made it their heaven .
Rice farming is very good here .
This place is the reservoir of rice .
This ten miles long rock is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of cultivating .
The need of irrigation gets fulfilled with the Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley four folds .
In the middle of the chains laden with the snow of the left hand a slight redness emanating in the sky occurs .
Excellent cough in air is cold .
Along with the chilling cold one also gets the feeling of moisture .
The sound of garbage under the feet is seen on the layer spread on the floor of the wood .
There is a silence in the environment and due to the shadow of fog before sunrise nothing is visible more .
The eyesight stays on the reddening of the vision .
One feels like sitting on a bench lying in balcony .
As soon as the hand is pressed the smooth layer of the claws slides with the sound of a mild crater and the hand moves away with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of living the night in this small village based amidst snow laden mountains of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spend most of the time in geneba or its nearby areas .
On both the sides of the slightly thin Balkhandi river the dense population settled in the valley is spread far and wide on the slopes .
This is the valley of Ron , the main river of Switzerland , on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
Highways contiguous with the Ron river and the vehicles shouting at it have begun to give a clear impression .
At a distance of 300 k . . the journey of two and a half hours by car is half way , parallel to Geneva lake and along half Ron river the Ron river coming from east direction meets the Geneva lake which is called in French -LRB- Lake -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled on the western tip of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there after becoming a river again the lake moves towards west .
On the right side across the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke from the left side we come towards the mountain road towards the north leaving this highway .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun of Afghan is giving full sunshine to all the birds .
The amount of snow in comparison to the valley is less here - almost not equal .
The lifestyle moves towards height , the density of the snow has increased .
Despite good cough and snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no specific cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this circular mountainous road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Shailken roofs are big , multi-storied bungalows made of pure wood .
In the basement made of the cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , lodge along with parking of vehicles .
Valaya is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of wine production of grapes .
Grapes are cultivated on 37  of the whole of the cantonment .
Settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of Grand present a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the botanical gardens to the ground , touring them , resting at night in the villages there and tasting wine in the factories of grapes is an integral part of tourism business here .
There is a huge museum of grapes in a tiny town named Age built in 12th century to see which foreign travellers have to make an aggressive booking .
Once again we crossed the same jungle having been dissolved from Dwanal .
The mind becomes even more frustrated by the pricking questions of the children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
At one turn a dramatic and charming change comes from the viewpoint .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the top of the deep valley a beautiful crowd of houses is settled .
On sloping from the top of the village people are skiing in the snow .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope a dense jungle of Mak deodar is spread .
Deep snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colonies are sparkling because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
The same silence is covered here as well .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley is the empire of the snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big circle in between that colony .
The name of the colony is Lukrabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Lukrabad is about 1500 .
The estimation of the number of tourists , sports persons and health workers coming here can be done from this point that there are 1700 apartments and shops of 6900 beds , 28 hotels to stay for 1500 stay , camping sites of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 sorts of hot water has been found till now in Lukrabad .
Out of these 40 lac litres everyday till 510 thermal pools made at various places in the entire towns of hot water are brought , some pools are inside the five star hotels and are according to the pockets of people of different classes .
Reaching the village one feels very hot .
In the bright sunshine above the roof of the houses a thick layer of snow is sparkling .
The name of Albenin is of this village .
Albenin village is one of the protected places in Switzerland in the form of heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can only go for Sikkim , that is why there is no checking .
The journey is continuing , the region is second , but the mountain is there , the trees are the same , the air is the same .
The smooth moisture of the whole body is there only .
In the rainy season the rhythmic light is the same .
The plan of the Darjeeling Yatra is firm and first of all the decisions of the Jhaki of Karsiyang was taken .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
It is famous for the production of excellent tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the people moving towards itself in Mussoorie .
Leaving a road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side is a green mountain full of forests and on the other is Hagiri trench .
There was a time when tea gardens were visible here .
All around was the empire of Har ki Doon .
Once I got tired , seeing these natural forests or plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the forest was the tea garden spread far and wide .
If we look at the road then it feels very amazing .
The current of snake charming and dilapidated paths were going on .
Time was also passing .
If we had not passed then forest and tea gardens .
At times small settlements are seen .
From a distance only one hilly house - house etc . were seen to be very dense .
This was Karsyang .
Staying at one place here we made the program of visiting the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Karsyang .
First of all Deer Parks .
A small garden is surrounded by huge forests all around .
To reach up to Sea Garden i . . Deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being brightened with the beauty of Karsyang now it has not been able to develop into a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the passage being deserted the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of walking amidst the trees of Dhupi was giving us courage .
The next place was Sea Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British , lovers used to give their lives by leaping from here .
Now , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a steep dome here on observing the entire city at a height of which a beautiful scene is seen .
In the nearby tea gardens women were engrossed in breaking tea leaf stretching their hands at a very fast pace .
There is a museum outside Karsyang city , but that day we could not go there , because touring the uninterrupted environment of tea gardens seemed very necessary .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was an adventurous experience in itself , but it was anxious that if it was raining so much we would roam around .
Incidentally it was very good that on reaching Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the fun of the scorching sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming .
On moving a little more down from here Gangamaya merges with hills .
Here amidst rocks the view of waterfalls is spectacular .
We found in Rock Gardens that the waterfalls of the rocks here are charming in the empire of rocks , then the charming world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is absorbed with worldwide stones .
Both these places are very low in the midst of Darjeeling hills .
On getting up on the support of the vehicle we saw Batasia Loop in Darjeeling .
The whole of the mountain and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telescope .
The taste of the weather was so far .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we get down and glittered .
In the evening there was a plan of strolling and shopping on the Mall Road .
In the tour of Darjeeling Towy Trains put four moonlights on the journey .
The journey from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and short stay in the garden .
From this route travellers also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans are found .
There is also arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , rather there is a stream of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Bell and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we have not been able to reach Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata and on the tour of Darjeeling the shadow of cold , and the tea gardens spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with us .
My recent small journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither from a foreign country nor from outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing in itself in which the journey sometimes draws towards itself , while sometimes it is a special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like a pink city or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of this only one special attraction people keep on pulling .
The place where I am going to talk about this bus has been prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation the place with which this place has come there , that has truly turned into a forest .
Not only for those going there , but also for those staying there .
My guide Ram Babu resonates in my ears , sir , we could not even imagine before this that we can stay so busy in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajbgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal look Aman Bagh .
He has given his speech to slope in a new color .
Saheb ' is the estimation of Amn Bagh .
Nobody calls you there by English .
Aman Bagh is actually a sanctuary with peace and all comfortable facilities .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also tells you about your familiarity with the nearby areas .
How many of the people spending holidays in Rajasthan 's royal style must have toured Bhangarh of ghosts .
After the opening of the Aman garden big people from the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Ajmi had called me there with Tehedil but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh via a road .
This time suddenly when I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guest , it seemed as if those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp to hunt .
Its construction was done in the nineteenth and twentieth .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Bagh appears to you .
As soon as you come inside the way you are welcomed , attention is paid to the divine peace here .
Along with the mauli dam in the wrist the mantra of Mangalacharan is made to live .
We arrived at the slope in the evening and intended to put a round of that garden .
Whatever is right like Meera Gompa , he said , This is interesting .
Inspired by all the havelis and palaces .
Their lighting is the most beautiful .
It is not surprising that on everything new artists have also received prizes in recent times .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajmer on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were cultivating .
This year on not raining we saw tobacco cultivation for the first time .
For this so much of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh via Jeep .
Early morning I had seen a traveller of Haland sitting in a deep meditation .
This is a million dollar precious moment .
The way to say the Alvida of Aman Bagh was also traditional , by feeding us jaggery and curd .
Now we came to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are kept to show tribal life as well .
Is it right .
Otherwise not only this happens in many states but tourists also show interest in coughing .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time travellers are taken to different places .
In this stay , food etc . are included .
This way there is an attempt to explore at such places where there has not been much development and where there has not been any special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this , old tourist spots etc are also present .
Besides this , attention is also paid on doing traditional cuisine survey .
Actually , the purpose of such tour is to make the tourists coordinate with the manners and traditions of the living and living of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
You can enjoy roaming alone despite being with a lot of people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without getting distracted .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with spending less and providing enough time these tours definitely keep demanding for sure .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is necessary to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching some foreign destination through bus tour .
Search the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc get discounts on them , then there is a discount for two people as well .
Although buying tickets is cheap in advance therefore it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moments that you plan plan first .
Find out about round trip instead of two way tickets .
It becomes cheap .
Rules are very strict regarding bags , so ask about the size and weight of the luggage .
It should not be so that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you have to fill the extra percentage .
Also know the rules of insurance and compensation of losses by the tour company .
Carry on bags are alright , lets go .
Because they fit in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the liability of the luggage will be your own .
From where you want to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the busy season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually the sooner you reach , the better seat options you will have .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the comfort .
If you feel more jerked on the back seat then reading at the front seat does not remain comfortable .
If you have to go to Loose again and again , then take a seat with a corner and if you do not like to be excessive then the seat with a window will be better for you .
Now this is the story of a hermit .
If you are in the middle of both the weapons , then sit on the seat at the edge and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then there will be plans .
If there is facility of basket in the bus , then keep this in mind while roaming around because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then in your place a new tourist can be found and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if you did n't see Rome in Europe then you did n't see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
Rome the capital of Italy is one of those old cities of the world from where civilization has developed .
This is the very reason that its influence is seen on western servicing .
Roman , Roman , settled on the Taibar river , is a pilgrimage for the followers of Catholic religion because the main ' Pope ' of this religion is in Rome itself .
Ancient Rome was settled on seven hills .
A wall cervical hair was built around it in the fourth century .

Here in the first world war unknown soldiers martyred were buried .
The excavation of this memorial and the victory symbols made on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you are interested in architecture then you must see it .
Along with the memorial is not only of Rome but also of Italy 's famous and magnificent chowk  Piazza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this chowk is famous as the Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this , Piazza de Spagana ' is also very popular among the tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying  Piazza Venezia ' you must also go to Rome 's famous road i . . Vya del corsa ' .
Big shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the grandeur of this road four folds .
It is significant that this road is the main road of Rome .
This magnificent building is built on ' Capitalin Hill ' and is located at quite a height .
Famous sculptor Michelangelo had built the stairs of climbing on it in 1536 .
There is a statue of the brass of riding emperor Marcus Orelius on a horse in front of Capitalin , who ruled Rome from 160 - 180 AD .
This magnificent statue will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capital Line is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and ancient temple are also built in  Captolin Complex ' .
The symbol of pimples is colossium .
This large arena was constructed in 80 AD and 50 thousand audiences could sit here .
Gladiator that is swimmers had shown their tricks in Kalosim .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These trembling wars of the heart used to continue with the waves of the other side or with the animals until one of the boys died .
In ancient Rome many ' Forum ' used to be there .
It is said that the place of meeting is called Forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political and other activities of the city used to take place .
Among these the most famous forum was Romani and the remains of Rajbhavan , temples and pillars are present even today at this place .
Surely by looking at them the glimpse of the beauty of ancient Rome becomes very beautiful .
Pathyan : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
In the middle of its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
Because of this place the devotees used to feel such as if their prayers are reaching directly to the gods .
Idols of gods - goddesses are built all around inside the temple .
Incidentally this temple was made a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome but Vila Bogris is unparalleled .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
Definitely go to the museum built here because on missing it you will miss the opportunity of being face to face with the best sculpture .
The idols built here are magnificent and seem to be so lively that it seems as if they are speaking now .
Here the statue lying on the platform of the first sister of Napoleon Palin , whose marriage took place in the Bogris Royal family , seems so lively that you will be able to see it for a while without seeing it .
The special attraction of Rome are its fountains .
Here there are approximately such buildings in which grand fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Tarevi Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome , then he should keep a coin with this wish .
It is believed that by doing so this desire is surely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not end until you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since sixth century this place has been the residence of Pope , the highest religious head of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter 's Square , fountains , museums etc of Vatican City .
Of course they will show you the view of a different world and will always give you a memorable experience .

Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option for cycling , reverse cruise , cold sea winds and enjoying comfortable holidays on the roads of Goa .
If seen on today 's date then the fare for Maldives is 28 thousand rupees per person for the most cheapest person .
After that if you stay in Malay you can still get hotels in less fare but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be smaller .
C cycler proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Church from Kochi started the sole Church of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Corbett is a European company and is quite popular in Corbett and Hotel Business .
Although due to some problems Lui Church has recently stabilised its services , but from October it is expected to start again .
You can go to Maldives for a three day tour at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at night on the ship of Louis cruise MV Aquarius .
That is the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two adults then children less than 15 years of age are totally free .
What else should one do .
Tea , breakfast , food are included in the fare of Church .
Every time entertainment gathers .
Reaching the capital Male . You can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket . From sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a plane stands in front of you while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But this tiny oater plane of 12 - 15 seats is unquestionably good for roaming in Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
On the surface of water while running like speed boat it does not get detected when it gets stuck in the air .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep looking at the blue water of different shades of Maldives , islands and coral islands .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them who has twenty sea planes .
If you want you can take an hour 's flight in around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or the complete sea plane for your day 's journey on rent -LRB- condition is full of pockets -RRB- .
As such if you go to an island beyond Male island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is a medium of journey amidst different islands .
And that is such a journey which you might never feel like ending .
Sea Plane runs from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttrakhand in Maveliwar -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and souvenir shops of the capital in the Ahmad Bazar of Male .
All the Selemen were listening very carefully to the speeches delivered by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
If we say honestly then no Indian has ever heard the speeches of the President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a unique creation of this earth then this seriousness was inevitable .
Many people might have considered the meeting held in water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October but Maldives has begun to go to Maldives but if the wrath of nature falls along with it then the world will be so rich .
There is something special about the beauty there .
In that small country no matter how beautiful it is .
Returning to the Jetty from that tour of the market to go back to its cruise , when the sight went in the waters of the sea along with the beauty cruises then it felt as if the people here understand the value of this beauty to a great extent .
The water was so clear that under the light of the lamppost fishes stuck in the depths of several metres were watching it clean with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see a few centimeters clearly in the water of sea or river attached to any city of India then you will consider yourself lucky .
Returning to M . . . Aquarius the evening spent in Malaysia was roaming around in the brain for two hours .
Coral reef -LRB- dry rocks -RRB- are the life here .
Even you will find mosquito rocks on the stones attached to the graves .
Just a while before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his official residence .
We could not believe that the residence of the best personality of any country was ahead , there was no security worker till far .
We were enjoying taking photographs of gardens and fountains just fifty metres away by placing our hands inside through the door of his bungalow .
You can think so about the house of such a leader in India .
It also came to be known that President sometimes crossing the road on foot he reaches his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day 's Vesbari .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of the Trans Maldives after crossing the runway .
Last evening when we reached near Cruise Mall then we recognized the plane as soon as we were passing from above .
Such pictures which were seen are of them .
But then it was not known that the next day there would be an opportunity to ride on it .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were about to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres away .
The scene of hundreds of monasteries and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from Sea Plane flying till the height of approximately thousand metres was unique .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was a breathtaking flight with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the corner of the Hillton Hotels on the Rangali island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which has no identity with any outside world .
Vasata was not so much that it was difficult to get out its beauty or grandeur .
Tour on Konark can be on foot as well or by a battery operated vehicle .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was marvellous .
Now we could not even make ourselves comfortable with the nature of the surroundings , that we reached such a place , was an epic .
Climbing down several metres down from the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Across all the sides we could see people doing unique types of small fish , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating and drinking sitting on decorated tables was extremely thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch on coming to this island in Sea Plane from Male is Rs . 47 thousand for a man .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to give our passport in water .
But I knew , it was not possible .
Return with this hope that you will surely find luck at some point of time .
We were planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to the evening arrangement this could not be possible .
Since childhood when wildlife was destitute then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking from Khardungla pass to Pegong lake .
On the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but due to the excitement in which we got out , Koray made our fast ropeway .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Kora from above and bad road in front .
Many a times it came to be known that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at eight in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our climber was in Dukuli near the park , whose booking we had done earlier .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to visit beside Kosi .
After spending two-three hours in the carpet museum came out which was very difficult at the Dhangri Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was quite evening while returning .
It was frozen from Delhi that when a lion roaming free in the jungle looked like a lion then in the dream of the whole night I kept showing her lions .
In the midst of the darkness of the night I suddenly heard a strong roar and after that the dogs who started trembling did not remain silent for two hours .
First a suggestion came to visit Kaladangi and Corbett Falls .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladangi , where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
We returned back and forth at twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this village .
On reaching Turkey the traveller Gypsy was waiting for us .
It has been told that they have arranged for skiing in the number one site of that place .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland there and during this time turtles come towards that side only to escape from cold .
Just as we reached Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees to roam around four hours .
We went inside for the jungle .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two twin elephants , which had long teeth .
I did photography regularly .
In between the guide started trekking the Tiger .
Guide said that there are around 150 turtles in the park out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but on not seeing the tiger I was sad .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind there was a fountain ride of Tiger .
That is why I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I brought him the same phone .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He asked whether he had seen the turret or not .
His words were kissed like arrows .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us that you take a safari for inside .
During the journey it was discovered that due to being on the highway near the park animals often get injured or die while jumping with the vehicles .
