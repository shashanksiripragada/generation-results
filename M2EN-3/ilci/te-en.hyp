Their language seems different from Gujarati .
Yes , otherwise .
On one side of Kuchh is Sindh and on the other hand Gujarat is therefore a mixture of both in language as well .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Although here is ' speaking language ' which has no copies of its own .
If you want to write kachhi then you have to write in the script of Gujarati .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where several times earthquakes occurred and the entire city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jasal-Toral is very charming .
The path through which we came back if we came back then we had to take a month 's holiday again and schools were opened there in Mumbai .
But what should we do now we make a journey by telling a taxi to the fast buses of Gujarat .
Small trains going to metre gauge from Bhuj reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad big trains of broad gauge will be taken to Mumbai .
Considered as the main base of the economy of Rajasthan tourism system is going on in a very bad situation during these days .
There is a great dearth of tourism due to the fear of increasing intensity in Vaishno Devi and South Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan with the point of view of tourism has become very less in these days .
It is said that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has come down by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to calculations there has been a reduction of 9 . 87 percent in national tourism and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 are domestic and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism department are worried a lot about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , founder of Rajputana Holiday Mekars says that the tourism system was completely affected by the mishap of Vishwik and the incidents of extremism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even developed the development of tourism here on a strong basis .
Due to this reason the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of time today .
This is the first time since 2002 that a reduction in the number of tourists of Rajasthan occurs .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests everything is ancient for the enjoyment of tourists .
In the area of tourism all governments talk of working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Travellers coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and mischief in Rajasthan with foreign tourists have also taken the beauty of this state to an international level .
Just a few years back the government of Rajasthan has given the status of tourism to a tourism industry but it has limited it to only papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
With the purpose of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism the government of Rajasthan established RTDC in 1979 AD .
These branches provide the facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 models , eight colleges , three journeys , one united journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels but this institute has also remained behind for many years .
It is estimated that the loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh and in 2009 - 10 it had increased to 632 lakhs .
The condition of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years in these hotels 40 percent rooms have not been filled .
Along with hotels other branches of the organization also cause a lot of harm to it .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Travellers are unable to attract this train .
Despite the reduction of fares it could not attract tourists .
Like this at present in the Pushkar Fair also the interest of travellers has been seen to be less .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair there were 398 foreign tourists who this year there were only 217 people reducing this number .
In the midst of all this the interesting thing of RTDC is that there was no reduction in attracting tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . city train .
This train is continuously profiting .
Last year through this train RTDC got a profit of nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to this reduction in the area of tourism in Rajasthan tourism has become easy .
Tourism is the biggest base of Rajasthan economy .
If a person has a desire to do something in his mind then he can make gold from soil .
Subrata Roy showed it the truth by building the modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dream which he dreamt was developing everyday and on seeing that glittering light is visible in his eyes .
His this joy was also seen at the start of the Amby Valley Airport .
The work of Amby Valley started and today Amby Valley has been successful in establishing its place as a good city .
In this city spread in more than 10 , 000 crores only hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available in 9 percent of the land .
Plants , ponds , waterfalls , potentines and other facilities have been made available in 91 percent land .
Built only for Kotishwar , many industrialists have come forward to make their house and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and wealthy people bought their rest houses here in the form of holiday home but today they have made it their first home and keep on coming to Mumbai for work from here .
Behind Amby Valley itself is Koyarigarh Fort which provides the region with immense beauty .
The ruins of the Likawali Bugyal in West Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found during the excavations .
Statues of gods and goddesses are found during excavations on the rocky pillars of this temple which are mostly in ruins .
Malininath is a major place of this mountain .
At this very place a ten-handed idol of Durga ji was found .
Behind the renovation of this idol and place many sweet stories and archaeological stories of the locals here are present .
The relics of Devlapani Bhagwan are singing the glorious stories of Arunachal even today .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories one gets the description of the gloriousness of Tamreshwari Devi .
During the reign of Chetiya kings in the north - eastern hills this god is believed to be of far - off places .
The wild people here used to worship Goddess .
Here humans were also sacrificed , after that King Gaurinath Singh was forbidden .
In Lohit district of Arunachal some more ruins have been found .
It is said to be the ruins of Bhishmaknagar that it is in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories published here this place was ancient Vidarbha itself where once King Bhishmak used to rule .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The Deegru , Mishmi , etc tribes here are the guides of the tourists .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith in this palace .
Near only to Brahmakund is the main Parashuram Kund .
On the day of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Apart from the above mentioned ruins describing the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of bricks made of bricks near rolling are telling their stories even today .
Bathing art , mud and another pond being surrounded by mud walls and obtaining remains of wide roads sings its ancient grandeur even today .
We reach ero from Shaharnaart Lakhimpur situated at the top of Assam by jeep at four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subasari district .
Located at a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts everybody 's heart .
This is that very entertaining place where very important situations are there .
It took several days to reach here before going to the jeep through the roadways .
On reaching here the views of trees of high cedar , beautiful primrose , vault , wild crocodile , strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the tourists .
Apple and aluch are grown here a lot .
Located at a height of approximately 1524 metres a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people settled in a state of decay .
They have made it their heaven by the people of very diligent state .
Vegetables are grown here a lot .
This place is  Vera Bhandaar ' .
This ten miles long field is a testimony to their hard work and professionalism .
Their cultivation is sufficient through Kali Nadi .
The beauty of this valley enhances by four folds .
The eye falls on the red color of the sky rising on the horizon amidst the snowclad mountain range located towards the left hand .
There is a very good cold in the air .
One also feels moisture along with the shivering coolness in the weather .
While putting your legs on the spreading layer of wood is paid attention to by a sound .
The weather is silent and before sunrise one does not seem to be very good due to dullness .
The eye sight stays on the red color of the east .
One feels like sitting on a bench situated in Balkanni .
As soon as the hand is fallen the thin layer of the hand slows down with the sound and the hand disappears soon after the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first feeling of spending the night in this small village based amidst these mountains of Switzerland covered with snow .
This is my third foreigner residence in Switzerland .
Before this spend a long time in Geneva or its nearby areas .
Most of the people settled in the valleys of both the sides of the thin Balkhati river are scattered to a great height on slight rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron valley on both sides of which are several small and big cities .
Parallel to the Rhone river the national highway and the vehicles passing on it are clearly visible .
At a distance of 300 kms and a journey of two and a half hours in the car , half past two and a half hours , along with the waterfall of Geneva parallel and the Ron river coming from east along with the Ron river , near the city of Montro , Geneva waterfall which is called Lake Lema in French is included in it .
In the west of this 100 km long and 10 km wide waterfall is Geneva city .
From there the waterfall again turns into a river and flows towards the west .
The waterfall on the right side is the sky touching Alps mountain range .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we left this highway on the left side , we come towards the mountainous road situated in the north .
Because of the hilly plains being towards the south the sun sets in the third watch .
The perimeter of snow in comparison to valleys can not be thought less here .
The way walking towards the height , the dense layer of snow is increasing .
Although there is a lot of snow on both sides of the roads but due to the calm and shining sun there is no cold in the air .
After covering a distance of about 20 k . . on these sloping hilly roads in half an hour we reached a small village called Thal .
Stone - slabs are large havelis made of wood , full of wood .
In this three storied building along with boarding vehicles in the foundation stone made of cement concrete there are parts of controlling essential facilities like electricity , water , laundry .
Valai is famous for grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of wine grapes drinking .
Grapes are found in 37 percent of the total area of the canal .
Grapes in the villages located on both the sides of the Rhone valley give importance to the unique beauty there .
Walking on foot in the vineyard , roaming around , resting at night in the villages there and showing the taste of alcohol by going to the liquor industry is a part of the tourism department here .
There is a very big museum of grapes in a 12th century made in a small business of Agne to see which foreign tourists have to do an agrim booking .
Once again we go through that deserted jungle with fire .
The mind of the children crossing three - four k . . . is even more obsessed with the question of asking .
Suddenly a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene of a turn .
Right straight , on the left side of the road on the very deep plains a beautiful group of houses are settled .
People are skiing on snow in a flat field beside the village .
Above skiing slope till Kond top dense forest of cedars is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The puja is shining because of the sun rays falling on the houses in the village .
In five minutes we reached that village .
The same calmness is spread here as well .
All around there is a bright empire of snow from the mountain peaks to the valleys .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that profession .
The name of Vrindavan is Lukarabad .
The population of Lukorabad based at a height of 4500 feet from sea level is approximately 1500 hundred .
The number of tourists , sports and healthy people coming here can be estimated with the fact that there are 1700 apartments with 6900 beds and style 1500 hotels for staying , 28 hotels for camping site , 90 bed health centres and 50 restaurants .
Till now 65 waterfalls of hot water has been discovered in Luckerabad .
40 lac litres -LRB- up to 510C -RRB- litres of hot water coming out of these reach everyday the small and big dharamshalas situated at every asked time , some bridges are inside five star hotels and people of different age groups according to the fees .
On reaching the village you feel full heat .
In the bright sunshine of the brightening sun the ice above the roof of the house is shining .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village , Switzerland has got the place of national wealth conservation .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim ' s only Sikkim ' s taxis are run so that checking does not happen .
The journey is on , the area is different , but the hill is same , the same is the trees - plants , the sounding wind is same .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the blue light of the rainy season .
With the decision of the journey of Darjeeling first of all a decision was taken to take blankets of Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of smoke is filled with forests .
It is famous for the production of excellent tea .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siligudi then in the beginning tea gardens smile and greet the people coming towards you .
Going on the road from the middle of the tea gardens attracts the heart the first time .
On one side green mountains full of forests , on the other side dense jungles .
There was a time when tea gardens were seen here .
All around there was a green empire .
Once I was nervous whether I had seen this natural jungle or had seen a tea garden set up by humans .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness , the more beautiful wilderness the tea gardens .
While walking on the roads on the roads the creation seems marvellous .
We were passing by the curves going to Pamula and passing through the way .
Time is also passing .
Forest and tea gardens are not finished at all .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From a distance on a hill houses and buildings etc . have been seen very queuing .
This is Karsiyang .
Staying here at one place we made a plan to visit the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a journey of Karsiyang .
First of all Deer park .
A small garden has huge forests all around .
One has to go up that is to reach the deer park the vehicle has to be left very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang is spread upwards but now it has not been able to develop into a tourist spot .
Although the city is very good and very peaceful .
The way was getting ready to reach the deer park filled with forests , the joy of climbing the way between the trees of ecstasy and incense used to give us courage .
The other place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that in British times lovers used to take their lives by jumping from here .
Although there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Siddhuma dome here which looks beautiful from the heights to see the whole of the city .
In the nearby tea gardens women are engrossed in snatching tea leaves with great speed tied in binoculars .
There is a museum outside Kaisang city but that day we could not go there because touring the beautiful environment of tea gardens seemed very important .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
This was an adventurous feeling for us , but it was very painful because of this that if it was raining this way we could roam around .
But the weather was very good and after reaching till the rock garden we roamed around enjoying the bright sunshine of that time .
This garden is a beautiful place adorned with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
On walking a little below from here Gangamaya was visible having picked up some mountains .
Here amidst rocks a magic of waterfall is seen .
We saw in Rock Garden that the waterfalls falling in the empire of rocks and stones here were decorated with the rocks of the world by the waterfalls of Gangamaya .
Both these places are very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw smoke in Darjeeling after climbing up with the help of vehicle .
With the help of telescope from here all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen .
The quantity of weather was very clear till now .
When we set out towards Monastery , then the crowd of clouds came from where we did n't know and the clouds were hanging .
In the evening there was a plan of shopping on the Mall Road .
The journey of Toy Train in the journey of Darjeeling enhances the beauty of the heart by four folds .
Train journey from Darjeeling to Gum and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake here and a short break in the garden .
Through this way tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazaar , where hand made sweaters etc are available in Nepali industry .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also available .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different from colors .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but the sound of forest - waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling to tour Darjeeling in the winter season but the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling here had bound our face on their own .
A small journey of my state was very charming and thrilling .
This journey is not of foreign countries but is not outside Rajasthan , but is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing of ourselves in which the journey draws towards itself sometimes , sometimes some special place , water ship or city can be a city like a city full of roses or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place about which I am talking about was made only four and a half years ago , but with the construction that this place came here , he actually blessed the forest .
Not just for the people going there but also for the people staying there .
In my ears my guide Rambabu Minar resonates , sir , before this we did n't even think that we could stay like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent of the population is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did n't get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabgarh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and today this magnificent palace is in the Aman garden .
He made his own words and deeds appear a new way .
Ayodhya ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
Nobody speaks English language over there .
Amman Bagh is actually a peaceful and peaceful tourist place .
This garden has its own history and the most important thing is that it will also introduce you to the nearby areas .
How many people have spent their holidays in the havelis of the emperors of Rajasthan who have roamed in the ruins of the past , why do they have to go away even among the people of Jaipur who have spent the night at this very place .
After the construction of Aman Bagh large and big people of the country and abroad came there .
I remembered that night also when Shabana Azmi called me completely there but I could not go .
This thing that she herself got lost and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there with the invitation of our foreign relatives but it seemed as if those people who wanted to spend their holidays in less time they had to go to Aman bag .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen hundred and twenty .
Its ancient wall is testimony to those days .
Full of mountains and in the shadow of sulphur the first glitter of Aman bag hypnotises you .
As soon as you come inside you will welcome you , by which you will feel that you have paid attention to the great peace here .
Along with tying a bandage on the head of the wrist the mantras of Aarti are sacrificed .
We reached there in the evening and felt as if we were putting in that garden around .
The jewellery of our host was decorating us , immediately we gave peace that it was very interesting to me .
All monuments and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Yes , all new things , artistic , no wonder Amman Bagh has got the award even today .
The manager set up our program in the morning .
First of all a walk with Rambabu and then a jeep journey of Bhangad .
While walking on small roads we saw the fort of Ajmer on which the sun rays were spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farming was done .
This year it did n't rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
This splendor of rural life in Jackie Kosam is a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangad by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit of millions of dollars .
Aman Bag 's way of living is also hereditary that by feeding jaggery and curd we were asked leaves .
Then it came to be known why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also being made to show trail life .
What is it true .
There is no doubt and this happens not only in many states but tourists also show great interest in it .
This tour is usually decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying , eating etc are also included .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where there has not been much improvement and there has not been an effect on the nature and the lifestyle of people on time .
Along with this there are also ancient tourist sites etc .
Besides this , paying attention to traditional cooking is also done .
Actually , tourists with the goal of such travel have to show straight the methods of dressing and tradition at that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think but such tours are really very interesting and experienced .
A lot of journey is enjoyable for us .
With this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone despite being with people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a long time clearance .
Yes , here it is so important that we make a request to spend a lot of time and to be comfortable in this journey .
This is the very reason that for enjoying this definitely remember some things , specially sometimes even foreigners are watching with you through local tourism .
Look for a good middleman before taking a ticket .
Students , seniors of the army , kids , etc get rid of this in which there is facility of stone both .
It will be better if you take a ticket earlier hence it is better to plan a bus tour for the last minute before planning .
Know about the total tour rate instead of tour ticket .
This is cheap .
There are some suggestions for the stuff as well , therefore one should also know about the quantity and weight of the stuff .
If this is happening somewhere then you have to leave some of your stuff in the terminal or you have to pay more money .
Also know about insurance and loss in tour companies .
Carry on bags are alright , take them and go .
Because they fit in the rocks above the seat .
Also keep in mind that during the journey while changing the bus the luggage will be yourself .
From wherever you want to board the bus you should reach there an hour before the time .
You should take special care of this thing in the time of rushing .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better you will have the chance of getting a seat .
While choosing the seat keep in mind your convenience also .
There are many irritations in the back seat but reading in the front seat is not appropriate .
If you have to go for urine frequently then take the last seat and do not like to get over it then the seat on the window side will be appropriate for you .
Now one more interesting thing .
If you are in the seat by keeping the hands on both the sides then sit in the last seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much people in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washing in bus then keep this thing in mind while choosing a seat because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Introduce to the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get to know very important things from them .
They ask everyone to come out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat so that the bus does not take responsibility for it if they go .
Whenever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , you can get your place to a new tourist and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

Cycling river cruise on the roads of Goa , cold seashore winds and Ginger hotels located here are very convinient to spend comfortable days enjoying the best wishes of the world famous Goans .
In today 's situation the fare for going to Maldi is 28 thousand rupees per person coming back very cheap from Delhi .
After this if you stay in the fair then you can still get hotels at a slightly less price but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives if you go to any island nearby then money will be lost in your pocket .
Sea cruise is very useful here .
In the first week of December itself Luickruz Maldives and Colombo had started a single cruise of India from Kochi .
Louis Cruise has achieved a lot of reputation in the European companies and cruise hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Lui cruise has reduced its services now but it is expected that it will start resuming from October .
You can go to Maldives on a three day cruise on a cruise of approximately Rs . 5850 per person per night in the ship of Louis cruise Emvi Aquatic .
Meaning the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two adults then the child in the age of 15 years is completely free .
One more thing .
Tea-tiffin , food are available on rent for cruise only .
Every moment there are pillars of time .
On reaching capital Male you can enjoy the options and activities available in Maldives according to your pocket , from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a sea plane comes before you and then you will feel like a toy .
But this twin oator plane of 12 - 15 seats is the best for roaming in archipelago like Maldives .
Do n't know when it flies in the air running like a speed boat on water .
You will not feel like flying in the entire flight on an ordinary plane .
Each moment your sight will be able to look downwards from the window and in the blue colored waters of different parts of Maldives you will get covered with fog of the resort islands and coral islands .
Everything looks so good .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldivian is one of them which has twenty sea planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or you can take it on rent for spending the entire day in the entire sea plane .
Although if you go to another island from the island then a sea plane journey is necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey that your mind will never feel like finishing it .
The journey of 12 k . . to 183 k . . of sea plane is done on Maldives island .
We were in the biggest antique and souvenir shops of the capital of Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
Salesmen are listening with great care to the contribution given by the president of Maldives Mahmood Nasheed in the contribution of world environment tourism in Copenhagen a day earlier .
Actually I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of state presidents or prime ministers so carefully .
But when there are questions of a new creation on this earth then this seriousness is incomparable .
Many people considered it unsuccessful in meeting waterfalls through carbonates in Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it feels as if nature calamities are drawing from us that how bad the world is landing .
There are some such specialities in its beauty .
As if the beauty of that small country is mesmerising .
While returning to the jetty to return back to its cruise from that market , when our sight goes towards the waters of the sea while moving towards the road then it feels as if the people here can understand the value of these beauty .
The water is so clear that fish swimming in depth of many metres below the lappost light is seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can fully see a few centimetres of sea or river water from any city of India then you will consider yourself very fortunate .
Reaching Emvie Aquarin the evening spent in Male were roaming around for two hours .
Coral reef is the life here .
As far as possible you will get to see the rocks of coral on the stones of the tombs .
We were standing outside their government residence just moments before listening to President Nasheed 's speech .
It is not a belief that we are in front of the highest courtyard of the other country and for some time no one is safe .
We enjoyed going through the gateway of their house taking photographs of vasara and gardens located at a distance of about fifty kilometres .
Can you think of any royal family in India in such a way
Here it is also known that president sometimes crossing the road walking on foot goes to his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about Maldives is astonishing .
This is why I was waiting for the next day .
Devvani i . . on that day some special incident would take place .
In the morning a ship from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached around on the runway to Maldives base .
Earlier in the evening when the cruise reached near Male we immediately remembered the sea plane moving above .
How many photographs have they seen .
But then it was not lost the next day there was a chance to travel in it .
Through the sea plane of Trans Maldives we had to go to Rangali island of hundred and five kilometres .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea level flying till the height of approximately a thousand kms .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is a thrilling and exciting courage to climb the breath by holding it fast .
But on reaching the conrad resort of Hillton Hotels in Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which has no relation with any country outside it .
Vasta is also not that it is difficult to find such beauty or luxury outside .
Walking on the Konark is also possible or by the vehicles running with the battery .
On both the sides of the bridge while moving towards the main island from Jetty the views of the lifestyle of the tribes are unique .
Now we are not even naturally able to believe ourselves in the surrounding nature , we have reached such a place , which is incredible .
With the help of stairs many metres below the sea water we reached the room with glass which was inside the water .
This room is usually a dining room .
We will see all kinds of small and big fish , corals , snow crawling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating and drinking while sitting on the chairs decorated there was a lot of thrill for us .
The fare of seeing and underwater rushing on this island in Siplane from Malanche is 47 thousand rupees per person .
One did not feel like returning from there .
We were also ready to throw our passports in water .
But you know , this is not that easy .
With this belief that unlike this belief whenever there is a chance , then its fortune comes here for sure .
For many days plans are being made to come out of Delhi but due to work pressure nowhere could be possible .
Wildlife was liked since childhood , but because this time I thought not to go to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking from Khardungla pass to Pegog Lake .
In the month of 27 December we set out from Delhi for Jim Corbett , but the enthusiasm with which we set out the fog disappeared our speed .
The journey between Hafd to Gajrola is really hypnotised .
Snow above and roads in front .
Many a times it felt as if we had fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
Exactly we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhuli near the park , whose booking we had done beforehand .
That day there was a special program when we were in cold then first we went to roam on the shore of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we set out for Corbett museum , at a distance of 2 k . . from hard work Dhangadi is near Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar situated below .
Returning is the right evening .
As soon as we got out of Delhi we saw a lion roaming around in the jungle then we saw a lion roaming around in dreams all night .
At night in the middle of deep sleep I suddenly heard a very big sound and after that the dogs did n't start till two hours .
Incidentally the decision to visit Kaladungi and Corbett fall had come beforehand .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , only then came on the way to Corbett Fall .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett is a museum where some special things related to their real life are kept .
It was twelve and a half to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come into this village .
After reaching the resort gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that the facility of skiing was provided in number one point Bijarani there .
If we ask about number one then it is said that Grassland is more there and Tiger comes in that direction only to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide who took two hundred and fifty to roam around for four hours .
We set out to go inside the jungle .
We saw several types of animals and deer of different species there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had big teeth .
I photographed bravely .
In between the guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide said that there are around 150 tigers in the park among which some have died now .
At many places we also saw their twisted marks , but because of not seeing tigers I was disappointed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain the Tiger was enjoying the Earth .
That is why I remembered an old friend of Haldani .
I called him Saradake .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He asked whether he had seen the tiger or not .
His words are like an arrow for me .
I said softly , no .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us that you should take in safari .
