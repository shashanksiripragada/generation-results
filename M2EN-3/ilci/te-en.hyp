Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yeah, another one.
On one side of Kuchh is Sindh and on the other is Gujarat , that is why there is a mixture of both in languages as well .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Though there is a saying here , there is no writing of its own .
If you want to come to Kachhi then you will have to come to Gujarati script only .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has been devastated .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very charming .
The way through which we had come back on that way if we returned then we had to take the holidays of one month and there schools were opened in Mumbai .
But what to do  Now for the fast buses of Gujarat we will take a ride on the train by telling you the taxis .
Small train passing through metre gauge from Bhuj reaches Rajkot .
From there one more small train of metre gauge reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad vast train of broad gauge reaches Mumbai .
The tourism system believed to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going on in a very impoverished condition these days .
Due to the acute dangers of rising widespread growth in worldwide and South Asia tourism sector has become very difficult .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has reduced a lot during these days .
According to a new survey published recently by the Rajasthan government , the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 came down by more than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
According to calculations there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participate . In 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are there .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik the founder of Rajputna Holiday Makers has said that due to the incidents of Vishwavik Mandir and fast speed the tourism system is completely affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even developed the tourism industry here in a strong and dependent manner .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of French tourists is the maximum .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of time in the present year .
After 2002 this was the first time that there should be a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests all are also ancient for enjoying the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments say that working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism is very important but nothing has been done in this direction .
Travellers coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and molestation have also taken the beauty of this state to international level with foreign women tourists .
The Rajasthan government has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan a few years ago but it has become limited to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation is an example of the Rajasthan government 's victory in tourism .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them on the basis of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This shaft provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 motorways , eight batteries , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels are there but this institute is also lagging behind for many years .
The loss of RTDC during 2008 - 09 is estimated to be 185 lakh , this year there is an increase of 632 lakh in 2009-10 .
The location of hotels in this institute is such that even in the last five years in these hotels forty percent rooms are not filled .
Along with hotels other facilities of the organization are also very harmful for this .
Among these the main ones are the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Travellers are unable to attract this train .
Despite the reduction in fares this could not attract tourists .
This way during the Pushkar Fair at present also the favourites of travellers were seen less .
In the year 2007 - 08 this fair was organised in the tourist village constructed by the RTDC and 398 foreign tourists stayed that year this number has reduced to 217 .
The interesting thing about RTDC amidst all this is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the city train .
This train is continuously benefitting from it .
Last year RTDC benefited nine and a half crores by this train .
Due to this deficiency that has come in the tourist area of Rajasthan it has become quite natural to see the destruction of the area of tourism .
Tourism is the most base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from soil .
Subrata Roy showed it to be true by building a modern city Embo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dream that he dreamt of seeing while developing everyday looks fascinating in his eyes .
His joy was seen at the start of Amby Valley Niger Airport as well .
The work of Amby Valley started and today Amby Valley has been successful in making its place a good city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 thousand crore only in 9 percent land hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available .
Plants , ponds , waterfalls , ponds and other facilities have been made in 91 percent area .
Several industrialists have come forward to make their houses in this city only made for the fortnight and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and rich people bought their shelter here in the form of holiday houses but today they have built their first houses and from here they keep on coming to Mumbai for work .
Behind Amby Valley is the fort of Koyarigarh which makes this place very beautiful .
The ruins of Likawali in western Siyang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple were found during the excavations .
On the stone pillars of this temple idols of gods and goddesses have been found excavating which are in very dilapidated condition .
Malininath is a major place of this mountain .
At this place a ten hand statue of Durga Maa was found .
Behind this idol and region 's nomenclature many sweet tales and ancient tales of the local people are present here .
The ruins of Devilpani are still singing the glorious stories of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari goddess found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient stories the description of the glory of Goddess Tamreshwari is found .
During the reign of Chetia this goddess is considered to be of far flung areas in the mountains of north - east .
The jungle people here used to worship Goddess .
Here men were also sacrificed , after that King Gaurinath Singh was imprisoned .
Some more ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmaknagar , which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers .
According to the popular stories here this place was the ancient Vidarbha , where once King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes of Deeg , Mishmi etc . here are guides for the travellers .
These people themselves also take great care of this Homkund .
The main Parashuram Kunda is just near the Brahmakund .
On the day of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of ponds made of bricks near roaming are telling their stories even today .
The ruins of bathing , mud and other ponds around which are the walls of mud and the ruins of roads wide on which even today hypnotise its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero in four hours from the jeep of the upper Assamese king Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subasiri district .
Located at a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts the hearts of all .
This is that charming place where there is an urgent situation .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before going through the roadways .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful Premaroz , walnut , forest contracept , strawberries and rasberries enjoy .
Apple and aluch are very thrilling here .
Located at a height of approximately 1524 metres there is a valley spread till 26 kms .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people living in the deserted state .
They have made it their heaven .
There is an abundance of vegetation here .
This place is ' V Van Bhandagar ' .
This ten miles long field is a testimony to its labor and agricultural expertise .
Their farming is enough from Kali Nadi .
The beauty of this valley is enhanced by the pine .
Located towards the left hand in the middle of the snowclad mountain peak the eye falls on the red colored red colored skies emanating from the sky on the horizon .
There is very good cold in the air .
Along with the cool breeze blowing in the atmosphere one also feels the moisture .
A sound emanating from keeping the legs is seen on the layers of wood .
Because of the silence of the weather and the slowness before sunrise one does not get to see very well .
The vision remains on the red color of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balcony .
The thin layer spread just as the hand falls down slips with the sound of a slight sound and the hand breaks immediately after getting cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , Switzerland has come to this small village situated in the middle of these mountains covered with snow and this is the first experience in the life of spending the night .
This is my third foreign country in Swiss .
A long time before this was spent in Janiva or nearby .
Maximum people settled in the valleys on both the sides of the thin Balkhti river are spread up to a very height on the slopy rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rohn valley on both the sides of which are many small and big cities .
The national highway parallel to the Ron river and the vehicles passing above it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and half an hour journey in the car the Janiwa waterfall , parallel to the Janiwa waterfall and half a ropeway from the east with the Ron river , the Geneva waterfall near Montro city which is called Lake Lama in French is included in it .
Geneva city is located in the west of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the waterfall again flows westward after becoming a river .
On the right side are the peaks of the Alps while flowing brightly , touching the sky .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we left this highway on the left side by the road , and came to the northern side by the mountain way .
Due to being in the southern face of the mountainous plains the third day the sun is giving sunshine to all the corners .
The percentage of snow in comparison to the valleys is not less than this .
As we go towards the height , the snow keeps on increasing .
On both sides of the road despite being extremely snowy the weather is calm and shining sun there is no coolness in the air .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this barren mountainous road we reached a small village named Thale in half an hour .
There are large storied palaces with roofs of rocks , completely made of wood .
In this three storied building along with parking vehicles in the foundation stone made of cement concrete important facilities like electricity , water , laundry are also there .
Wallai is famous for grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of wine grapes .
In the total area of canals 37  grapes are found .
The grapes of the villages located on both sides of the Ron Valley provide a magnificent view of the gardens here .
Walking on foot in the vineyard , roaming around them in the villages there for night rest and exhibiting taste of alcohol by taking them into the liquor industry is a part of tourism department here .
There is a big museum of grapes in a narrow garden built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to do agrim booking .
Once again we crossed that desert jungle with Dawagan .
Children crossing three - four k . . become even more disappointed with the question of asking .
Suddenly from a turning point of view a dramatic and charming change comes .
Right straight , on the left side of the road in the field situated on a very deep valley a beautiful group of houses is established .
People are skiing in snow on the plains flat from the edge of the village .
On the skiing slope till Konda peak a dense forest of deodar is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The reason behind sun rays falling on the houses in the village is shining .
In five minutes we reached that village .
Here also the same peace is spread .
Snow laden empire ranging from mountain peaks to valleys all around .
Within five minutes of the coming we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that cycle .
The name of Vrikshana is ' Lukarbad ' .
The number of people of Leukarabad settled at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated with the fact that there are 1700 apartments with facilities of 6900 beds and style 1500 for stay , 28 hotels for stay , temporary camping site , 90 bed health centres and 50 restaurants .
Till now 65 waterfalls of hot water have been found in Lukarabad .

On reaching the village one feels extremely hot .
Snow stuck on the roof of the house glitters in the bright sunrise .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the survivors of the national wealth in Switzerland .
It has been said in Darjeeling that Sikkim only taxis go and therefore chewing can not be done .
The journey is going on , the place is on the other side , but the mountain is the same , the trees and the trees are on the other side , the wind is blowing .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the light of the blue color that rises in the rainy season .
As soon as the decision was taken for the journey of Darjeeling , the decision was taken for the first time to take caravans of Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small town in Darjeeling .
Complete with the tea gardens is filled with the jungles of Dhoopi .
It is famous for producing good tea .
If you go towards Darjeeling from Siligudi then in the beginning the tea gardens welcome the people coming towards it while searching for smiles .
Going through the road from the middle of the tea gardens attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains laden with jungles , on the other side a dense valley .
There was a time when tea gardens were visible in the jungle .
There was a green empire all around .
Do I once look at these natural jungles of Karnataka or see the tea gardens put by humans
Both were drawing towards themselves .
As beautiful as forests , tea gardens are so beautiful .
If you look at the roads on the way then the creation appears marvellous .
We were walking with crookedness going to Pamula and passing through the way .
Time is also passing .
Forest and tea gardens are not just the end .
Sometimes small settlements were visible .
From a distance on a mountain houses and buildings etc . were seen very nicely .
This is Karsiyang .
After stopping here we prepared a plan to tour the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out for the journey of Karsiyang .
First of all a deer park .
There is a large jungle all around a small garden .
Go up that is to reach the deer park one has to leave the vehicle very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang has spread till far and wide , till now the development - development of tourist spots has not taken place .
Although the city is very good and very peaceful .
The joy of climbing the path between charming and smokey trees was on our way to Deer Park full of jungles while the way was unfinished .
The other place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to take life by jumping from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Sidhuma cave here , looking at from a height a beautiful view of the entire city can be seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women were made to wear shoes on their backs , leaps and blankets .
There is a museum outside Kasyang city , but that day we could not go there , because it seemed necessary to tour the beautiful environment of tea garden .
Next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience in ourselves , but it was very painful that we could roam around in the same way as rains .
But the weather was very good that reaching till Rock Garden we had to roam around the setting sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
Going a little down from here the Gangamaya flowing above some hills was visible .
Here amidst rocks a mix of waterfalls is seen .
In Rock Garden we saw that if waterfalls break in the empire of rocks and rocks then the magic of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with rocks in the world .
Both of these places are very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of vehicle we saw smoke in Darjeeling .
All the hills and cities of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of turtles .
The quantity of the weather was very clear till now .
When we set out towards Monastery , the group of clouds came from where we did not know and the clouds were bursting .
In the evening there is a plan to shop by stopping on the mall road .
In the journey of Darjeeling the journey of the tower train enhances the beauty of the moonlight .
From Darjeeling to Gum and from Dhoom to Darjeeling the journey of tower train is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake here and a slight break in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath bazaar by this route , where sweaters etc . generated by hand are available in Nepali industry .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , whose size is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but there are sounds of jungles and waterfalls .
The most famous tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are filled with jungles and lakes .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
When we came to Darjeeling from Kolkata for a tour of Darjeeling in the winters , then the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling here turned on their faces .
A small journey in my condition was very pleasant and thrilling .
This journey is not of foreign countries but of Rajasthan , but is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes the journey pulls towards itself , sometimes it can be a major place , water ship or a city full of rail or pink cities or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place I am talking about was made just about four and a half years ago , but the construction with which this place came here , that is why he really praised the jungle .
Not only for the ones going there , but also for the ones living there .
Our guide Rambabu Mina was repeating in my ears , we did n't even think before this that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent of the population is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabagarh resident Rambabu had previously worked in Jaipur and today this great Shahi beauty is present in the Amman garden .
He himself has tired of a new method of expressing his words .
Ayya ' is the estimation of Aman bag .
Nobody will ever talk to you in English .
Aman Bag is indeed a peaceful and comfortable tourist spot .
This garden also has its own history and the most important thing is that you will also get to know about the regions nearby .
In the royal palaces of Rajasthan how many people have toured Bhangarh of the past , why should they go away even among the people of Jaipur if Kuchek had spent the night in this area .
After the construction of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad came there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there completely , but I could not go .
Another thing that she had herself gone to Bhangarh on her own .
This time suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreigner friends but it seemed as if those people who want to spend their holidays in a very short time have certainly left for Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen hundred and twenty years .
Its ancient wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman bag in the shadow of the mountains and sulphur trees will hypnotise you .
As you come in the same way you will be welcomed by which you will feel that you will pay attention to the great peace here .
Together with folding the head of the wrist the mantras of Aarti take the life of life .
We reached there in the evening and felt as if we were putting in that garden .
The joke of hosting for us was decorating , I immediately relaxed that it was very interesting for me .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Yes , all new things , are artistic . No wonder Amanbagh has received a prize today .
Manezer organised our program in the morning .
First of all a walking trip with Ramba and then a jeep journey in Bhangadh .
While going on the small road we saw the fort of Ajabagarh on which the rays of sun set gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the trains were trading .
This year it did n't rain but for the first time we saw cultivation of tobacco .
Jaiki Kosam is a unique experience of this glimpse of rural life .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning itself I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in a deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit of million dollars .
The same way as Aman bag Alavind was also hereditary and by feeding jaggery and curd we were given a ride .
Then it came to be understood that why do tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also put up to show the triple life .
Is it true .
No doubt and it does happen not only in many states and tourists also show much interest in it .
This tour is usually decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating , etc are also included in it .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where much development has not taken place and the quantity of life of nature and people have not been able to dominate over time .
Along with this ancient tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this , it is also taken care of doing treading , serving .
Actually , tourists accomplished with the goal of such journeys have to show the dressing methods and traditions of that place directly .
Although for thinking this feels a little difficulty here , but such tours are really very interesting and a different experience is experienced .
Several journeys are enjoyable for us .
With this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone even when you are with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can leave your favorite book for a long time .
Yes , it is so important here that along with expense and for a long time we oblige to stay comfortable in this journey .
This is the very reason that for enjoying these some things definitely keep in mind , specially when you are watching the destinations of foreigners by a tour .
Before taking a ticket look for a good deal .
Students , senior officers of the army , kids etc . get rid of them both .
As soon as it is cheaper to take a ticket beforehand so it is better to put a bus tour plan for the last minute before the planning process .
Instead of a tour ticket know about the entire tour rate .
This is cheap .
There are some indications of stuff as well hence you should also know about the amount and weight of the stuff .
If this happens somewhere then you will have to leave some of your things in the terminals or you will have to pay more money .
Also keep in mind the information of insurance or losing in the tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they come fit in the rocks situated on the seats .
It should also be kept in mind that during the journey while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage is on your own .
Wherever you go by bus , you reach there an hour ahead of time .
You should take special care of this point on rental times .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better the chance of getting the seat is also with you .
While choosing the seat keep an eye on your convenience as well .
There are many knots in the back seat , but it is not appropriate to read in the front seat .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again then take the last seat and if you do not like that much then the seat on the window bed will be very nice for you .
Now there is one more interesting thing .
If you are in a seat keeping your hands on both the sides then sit on the last seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is no more people in the bus then planning is successful .
If there is facility to wash in the bus then keep in mind that while choosing the seat also it is difficult to sit there after a while .
Inform the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
They ask everyone to come out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because if they go then the bus do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe , then you will not see anything else .

The statues of gods and goddesses are built around the temple .

The most famous fountain here is ' Trevie Pountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come to Rome again then he should put a coin in this fountain along with this desire .
It is believed that by doing this the desire will definitely be fulfilled .

Goa , the neighbouring state of Maharashtra , has its own beautiful sea shores and varieties of water reservoirs which is like a heaven for tourists where on seeing ancient churches the beauty of olden times is easily visible .
Situated on the western coast of the Ginger Hotel located in the capital of Goa , Panjim , is even more exciting for this journey .
Cycling river cruise on Goa ' s roads , cool sea cruise , and Ginger hotel situated here is very convenient to spend the comfortable days fully enjoying Goa ' s famous Goans .
If seen in the present situation then for going to Maldi the fare from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees per person .
After this if you stay in the fair even then you can get hotels for a little less but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then money will be reduced in the pocket .
Secrets have proved to be very useful here .
From Kochi in the first week of December itself Lake Cruise , Maldives and Colombo had started the only cruise of India .
Louis Cruise has got a lot of name in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has now reduced its services but it is hoped that it will start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a cruise of approximately Rs . 5850 per person in the Luis Cruise ship Aquamerin for a three day cruise .
That is , the fare for a person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then the child in the age of 15 years is absolutely free .
One should take it any more .
Tea-tiffin , food everything is available on the cruise fare .
Every moment there is time consciousness .
On reaching the capital Malai you can enjoy the moments and activity of the Maldives in accordance with the number of pockets - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
On roaming around in big airplanes suddenly one sipline comes in front of you and you will feel like a sportsball .
But this twin oterflane of 12 - 15 seats is the best for roaming in archipelago like Maldives .
Running like a spider boat on water it is not known when it flies in the air .
On flying fully you will not feel like flying ordinary airplanes .
Every moment your sight will start looking down from the window , in the blue water of the multicoloured sights of Maldives the resort islands and coral islands will be covered with fog .
Everything looks so good .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them near which are twenty sea planes .
If you want you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in air for an hour or you can take the fare of spending your whole day on the entire sea plane .
Although if you go to another island from the island then there is a need of a sea plane journey because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which your heart never feels like finishing .
The journey of 12 k . . to 183 k . . from sea plane is done on Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovereign shops of the capital of Ahmadi market of Malaysia .
The salesmanship of Maldives is listening very carefully to the conference given by the President of Maldives Mahmoud Nasheed in Copenhagen the World Environment Day .
The truth is that no Indian has ever seen so much listening to the talks of the presidents of the state or prime minister .
But when there are questions of a new creation on this earth , then such seriousness is incomparable .
Several people consider it unsuccessful in the meeting happening in the water of the Maldives in October but going to the Maldives it feels as if the nature has drawn from us the opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite the world to be so bad .
There are some such places in the beauty there .
Believe it that how much beauty is there in that small country .
When we returned back to the jetty to return to our cruise from that bazaar safari then as we turned our gaze towards the waters of the sea and felt as if the people here could understand the value of these beauty .
The water is so clear that the fish swimming in depths of several metres below the lappost can be seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you will see a few centimetres of water of sea or river separate from any city of India then you will consider yourself very lucky .
The evening spent in Malaysia while returning to Aquarius was roaming in the jungle .
Coral reef is the life here .
As far as possible you will get to see thunderstorms of coral in the stones situated on the tombs as well .
A few moments before the conference of President Nasheed we were standing outside his government residence .
It is not believed that we were ahead of the supreme testimony of the other country till some time no one could be safeguarded .
It 's a lot of fun , we take photographs of Vasara and Garden situated about 50 kilometres away after entering through the gateway of their house .
Can you think of a political house in India like this
It was also known here that the president sometimes went to his office two blacksmiths after crossing the road on foot .
Everything was surprising about the Maldives .
That is why I have waited a lot for the next day .
That is Devvani i . . some special incident will happen on that day .
In the morning a ship from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Maldives by roaming around in the highway .
The next evening when the cruise reached near Male we immediately remembered the sea plane moving above .
They had seen how many photographs .
But then it did n't get lost the next day opportunity of traveling in it .
We had to go to Rangli Island of 100 five kilometres through the sea plane of Trash Maldives .
Watching thousands of resorts and coral islands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately a thousand kms is an unforgettable experience .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous and thrilling adventurous to ascend fast in breathing .
But after reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel in Rangli Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , outside which there is no relation with any country .
It is not like that also where it is difficult to get out such beauty or luxury .
Walking on Konark is either possible on foot or by battery-driven vehicles .
The lifestyle of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge going till the main island from Jetty is unique .
Now in the nature around us we are not even able to believe ourselves naturally , we have reached such a place which is unimaginable .
With the help of stairs we reached the room with glass which was under water going through the sea water several metres below .
This room is normally a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small and big fishes , corals , snow crawling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating and drinking on decorated chairs here makes us very thrilling .
The fare of visiting this island in Siplane from Malaysia and underwater ring is 47 thousand rupees per person .
Heart did n't feel like coming back from there .
We were also ready to tear our passports into water .
But you know , this is not that easy .
Beware of this belief that whenever there is a chance , then fortune brings it here for sure .
I was planning to get out of Delhi for several days but due to pressure of work it was not possible to go anywhere .
Since childhood wildlife was liked but because I had thought of going to Jim Corbett this time .
After biking till Pegog Lake situated ahead of Khardugula in Laddakh in 2006 this is the second bike tour .
In the month of 27 December we set out for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the enthusiasm with which we got out we forgot our speed .
We really got hungry in the journey between food and Ghazola .
Smoke on top and uneven roads in front .
Several times we felt that we had gone further .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had booked beforehand .
That day there was a special program that was during winters when first we went to roam on the coast of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett museum , which was at a distance of 2 k . . from extreme distress was near Dhangadhi gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar situated below .
It is evening for the return .
After deciding from Delhi we definitely saw a lion roaming around in the jungle and in the dream of a lion was visible to me all night .
In the middle of a deep sleep at night I suddenly heard a very loud sound and after that the dogs started screaming and did not get up for two hours .
The decision to visit Kaladungi and Corbett Falls had come just a while ago .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away only then came on the Corbett Fall road .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett is a museum , where some important items related to his real life are kept .
On returning it was twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
On reaching the resort the jeepsy of the journey is waiting for us .
It was told that they got the facility of singing in a suitable Bijarani there number one .
Asked about number one where Grasland is more and Tiger is there at this time itself to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide , who takes two hundred fifty rupees for roaming for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw several types of animals and deer of many species there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which has big teeth .
I took photographs with patience .
In the midst of this the guide started trekking on the tiger .
The guide said that there are around 150 tigers in the park , some of which are at present dead .
At many places we also saw signs of their claws , but because of no tiger being visible I remained sad .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a terrible earthquake in my mind .
That is why I remembered one of my old friends of Haldani .
I made a phone call to him only .
I told him that I came to Corbett .
He asked whether he had seen the tiger or not .
His words pierced me like an arrow .
I didn't say so slowly.
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone suggested us that you take safari inside .
