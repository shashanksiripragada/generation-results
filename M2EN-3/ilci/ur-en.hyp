Its tongue looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of some is Sindh and on the other hand Gujarat is also a mixture of both in this language .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
Although it is ' bidding ' , it does not have its own custom .
If something has to be written then it has to be written in the Gujarati routine .
Near Bhoj only is that Anjar city where several earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral .
The tale of Jaisalmer - Turel is very interesting .
If we return by the same route through which we had to come then we will have to spend a month 's holiday and get our school opened in Mumbai .
Now telling the fast buses of Gujarat they will travel by train .
A small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhoj .
From there another small train of metre gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry believed to be the main source of livelihood of Rajasthan is passing through both these illusions .
Due to the increasing threats in world recession and South Asia the profession of tourism has received a deep impression .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan among the major states of the country has been found to be very less these days .
The latest figures released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has come down by more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to the figures there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 thousand tourists came in Rajasthan , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 thousand and 14 lakh 77 thousand and 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
Of them 2558691 was included national and 1073414 foreign tourists .
People associated with the tourism sector are very anxious about this situation .
The director of Rajput Holiday Home Shri Sanjay Koshk says that accidents of worldwide renunciation and temptation have adversely affected the business of tourism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to prepare a strong infrastructure for our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the present year is the best option for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
Nothing new has happened with the point of view of tourism .
Desert , havelis , forts , palaces , forests , everything is the same old for attracting tourists .
In the area of tourism all governments do so in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done on this side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the warriors of breeding and mischief have also portrayed the importance of this state at an international level .
Years before Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it remained closed only on paper .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to encourage tourism infrastructure the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides the facilities of lodging , transportation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one traffic unit and two non-vegetarian palaces , Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The rate of RTDC in 2008 - 2009 was 185 lakh which is expected to be 632 lakh in the year 2009 - 2010 .
The condition of hotels of this colony is this that in the last five years even 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also reaching it vastly .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of the Royal Rajasthan .
The attraction of tourists towards this railway was not sinky .
Despite lessening the taxes it did n't attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair .
In the year 2007 in the tourist villages built by RTDC in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year this number has reduced to 217 .
In the midst of all this there is no dearth of the attraction of the tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This train is continuously providing benefits .
Last year from this train RTDC had a profit of nine and a half crore rupees .
From this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan the lines of anxiety has been seen naturally .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economics of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the heart of man then he can make one lie down on the soil .
Subrata Roy has done the truth by settling the modern city Amboveli in the Samadhishwar mountain range of Maharashtra .
The joy in their eyes is reflected in their dreams that they had seen while developing the body .
Its pleasure was also visible during the inauguration of the Naiji Airport of Ambuvali .
The work of Amby Valley started and today Amby Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of an excellent city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been established on only 9  land .
On 19 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many entrepreneurs came forward to build their houses in this city built for only crores of leaves and today there are around 800 families living in this city .
Initially entrepreneurs and priests bought their home here in the form of holiday houses but now they have made it their first home and from here Mumbai comes in search of work .
Behind Amveli itself is the Kyarigarh Fort which enhances the beauty of this area .
The ruins of Leeka Valley are very important in the western Siang district .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the idols of lotus and Gods and Goddesses are obtained which are mostly in a broken state .
Malininathan is an important place in this area .
An idol of Goddess Durga has been obtained at this place .
Behind the colonies of this idol and place many charming stories and ancient stories of the people here are famous .
The remains of the palaces of Deepavali even today is the glorious song of Arunachal .
The temple of Goddess Tamareesh is very famous among these ruins .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories one gets to see the colossal reference of the goddess Tamaswari Devi .
During the time of Chetia kings the distance of this goddess was accepted till far in the mountains of north and south .
The tribes here used to worship Goddess .
Humans were sacrificed here as well due to which King Gaurinath Singh had shut down .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohat district of Arunachal .
They are called ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the ground between the Debang and Dibang rivers here .
According to the popular folktales here this place is an ancient Vidarbha itself where once King Bhoja ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohat river which is a special place of Lohat district .
The Degru , Mishmi etcetera here show the way to the travellers .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pond .
Near Brahmakund only is the famous Parasuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned Khandharas described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal , the Khandhar of Roing in Divangiri district is also of very historical importance .
The ruins of the brick ponds near Roing even today are telling their stories .
The ruins of bathing ghats , pucca stairs and another pond being surrounded by pucca on all four sides and getting the remains of wide roads are still singing the silent songs of their ancient pride .
We reach ero from the city of Upper Assam , Norathpur , Jeep through four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lore Subansari district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place captivates the hearts of the people coming to it .
This is that charming place where you live .
Before the construction of the road of jeep it used to take several days to reach here .
On reaching here the sights of trees of high deodar , beautiful perimeter , wild crane , strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the visitors .
Apple and apricot are very rich here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of Orissa .
With their hard work their own people have made it their heaven .
Rice farming is very good here .
This place is a store of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and the expertise of farming .
The water of Kali Nadi fulfils the needs of its irrigation .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The eye falls on a slight redness rising in the sky on the peak right in the middle of the mountain range covered with snow of the left hand .
The air is very cold .
Along with the shivering coolness in the air one also gets the feeling of moisture .
The sound of garbage under the legs is seen on the layer of crevices scattered on the wooden floor .
There is moisture in the atmosphere and due to the shadow of light before sunrise much is not visible .
Eyes stay on the redness of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench lying in the balcony .
The smooth layer of the leg goes rolling with the sound by slightly grinding and the hand gets distinct from the shock by feeling cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of life to come and spend the night in this small village based amidst snow laden hills of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Soys .
Before this maximum time was spent in geneva or near it only .
The dense population of Khati river on both sides of thin streams is spread till quite a height on slopes .
This is the valley of the main river of Switzerland -LRB- Hone -RRB- on both the sides of which are several small and big cities .
Balanced highway of Ron river and ring vehicles have started to be seen clearly on it .
At a distance of 300 kilometres and half an hour journey by car meets the Geneva lake , which is called Lakkima -LRB- Lakkima -RRB- , near the Rondi river coming from eastern direction along with Geneva lake and half an hour journey by car .
Geneva city is settled on the western tip of this 300 km long and 10 km wide lake .
From there the lake again forms a river and moves forward towards the west .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
Crossing the city from a beautiful valley named Leuk we leave this highway from the left , come on the mountainous path towards the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun is giving full sunshine to all the corners of the evening .
In comparison to the valley the amount of snow is less here , almost not equal .
Lives move towards heights , the amount of snow starts increasing .
Despite good snowfall on both sides of the road there is no specific cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 k . . on this circular mountainous road in half an hour we reach a small village named Hale .
Chalet -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - many big storey bungalows made of slopy roofs are there .
In the basement made up of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of vehicles .
Valai is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine -LRB- Line -RRB- is a major center of grapes making alcohol .
Farming of grapes is done on 37 ' landmass of the whole of Cantonment .
The gardens of grapes in the villages on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking them to the gardens of grapes -LRB- inheritance -RRB- , roaming about them in the village at night and enjoying drunkards taking them to the factories of grapes -LRB- inexpensive -RRB- is an integral part of tourism beauty here .
A small town named Aizawl is a very big museum of Aguri Wine built in the 12th century in Chateau , to see which foreign tourists have to book first .
Once again we pass through the middle of the deserted forest .
Throughout the way of three - four kilometres mind gets distressed even more by the pressing questions of the children .
Suddenly at one turn a dramatic and charming change comes from the viewpoint .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley towards the left of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the flat slope from the top of the village .
The dense forest of Deodar is spread from the Skiing Slope to the peak of the upper mountain .
Great snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the villages are shining because of the direct sun rays .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same fun is spread .
All around there is a kingdom of dust from the top of the mountain to the valley .
Within five minutes we reach the middle of this town at a very big round chowk -LRB- foundabuot -RRB- .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Leukorabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sports persons and those who come here can be estimated with this fact that there are 1700 apartments and Shelley Chalits with 6900 beds . 28 hotels for staying -LRB- 1500 hotels -RRB- , camping sites of tobacco , the center of 90 beds for patients and 50 restaurants .
So far 65 sleeps of hot water have been found in Luckerbad .
40 lac litres -LRB- till 51 H . . -RRB- coming out of them reach the thermal bridges near about 30 big water colonies -LRB- Hermal Pools -RRB- , some of them are inside the five star hotels and others according to the pockets of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the scorching sun the thick surface of snow on the roof of the house is shimmering .
The name of Albenin is of this village .
Albanian village is one of the safest places in the form of national heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that in Sikkim only taxis of Sikkim can be done hence checking does not happen .
The journey is continuing , Prades may be another , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are the same , they are the serpentine winds .
The moisture on the whole body is same .
In the rainy season the sunrise is the same .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling was fixed it was decided to take the pleasure of Kurseong .
Kurseong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine jungles .
Famous for production of high tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning tea garden Muskrahat welcomes the people proceeding towards itself .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea estates enjoys the heart the first time .
Green mountains full of forests on one side and deep greenery on the other side .
The forest here used to be seen sometimes in tea gardens .
All around was the reign of greenery .
Once upon a time a lot of greenery has been done , to see these natural forests or to plant tea plantations by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful was the forest , the more beautiful tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we look at the streets of the road then it seems marvellous .
The trick of a snake was curving and going narrowly .
Time was also passing .
I wasn ' t passing , there were gardens of jungles and tea .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From afar only a very dense sight was visible from a mountainous house - house etc .
This was Kursing .
Staying at a place here we made a program of roaming the whole day .
We took a vehicle and set out on a tour of Crossing .
First of all the Deer Parks .
A small garden around is surrounded by large forests .
Upper had to be covered i . . till Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being brimming with the beauty of Kurseong the development of tourist spots has not yet been found to be popular .
Although the city is quite beautiful and clean .
Despite the deserted roads the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by the jungles and the desire to climb amidst the trees of sunshine was giving us calmness .
The next place was England Craig .
This is a point situated on the other side of the city at a height .
It is also called psychoid point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to get to know about jumping from here .
At present , this is decorated with a park and a restaurant .
There is a ladder like dome here from whose height the whole city has a beautiful view .
In the nearby tea gardens women were engrossed in breaking tea leaf stretching their hands very fast on their backs .
There is a museum outside Kurseong city , but that day we can not be found there , because it seemed necessary to roam around the charming atmosphere of tea gardens .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was in itself a charming experience , but there was a lot of anxiety about it that if it rained then how would we roam around .
But its unfathomable that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed playing sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On a little more than a little ahead from here on moving a little towards the top of the mountains Ghura Gangmaya was found .
Here amidst rocks the magnificence of waterfalls is spectacular .
We found in Rock Gardens that if waterfalls are blooming in the reign of leopards and rocks then worldwide waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with worldwide stones .
Both these places are located very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Botsia Loop in Darjeeling rising above the vehicle .
From here the whole of Darjeeling mountain and city can be seen with the help of Durban .
The nature of the weather was shining till now .
But just as we moved towards the monastery , where did we get down and started sliding .
In the evening walk and shopping programs were made on the Mall Road .
In the tour of Darjeeling the tourist trains enjoy the pleasure .
The tour of Darjeeling and the journey of the tour of Darjeeling from Dhoom to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
There is a bit of rest in the boating and garden in the Mirak lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by the same route , where sweaters made by the hand of Nepali artisans are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also available .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different .
Here tea gardens are not greenery but forests and waterfalls are available .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lole villages which are filled with forest waterfalls .
But in a short span of time this time we have not been able to get Kalimpong done .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of winter , but here tea gardens spread from Salligudi to Darjeeling tied me .
My recently a small journey was very interesting and mesmerising .
This journey was neither of a foreign country nor off Rajasthan , but of very close proximity to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself , in which the journey draws towards itself sometimes , sometimes there is a special place , water ship or some other city like a royal train or a pink cart or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people start pulling .
The place where I am going , that bus is made almost four and a half years back , but with the preparation of which this place has come there , it has truly turned into a forest .
Not only for people going there , but also for people staying there .
In my ears the guide recites the words of Rambabumina , but before this we could not even imagine that we can live like this in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this very area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did n't get work in the heritage hotel as well .
The residents of Pathankot Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this magnificent royal garden .
He has installed his own conversation in a new color .
The nearest railway station from Payyambalam - Karipur International Airport is at a distance of 2 K . .
Nobody calls you English there .
Shanti Bagh is truly a tourist place with peace and happiness .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also gives you information from the nearby areas .
How many of the people who spent their holidays in Rajasthan 's royal style would have spent the night in this area , wherefrom they would have gone far and wide , some would probably have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of the peace garden big people of foreign countries have reached there .
I remember that night also when the Prime Minister had invited me there at night but I had not gone .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Mangdhar by cracking the road .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guest , it seemed as if people want to spend a splendid holiday in less time , they must go to Peace Bagh .
This garden is a garden conserved in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp to hunt .
Its construction was done in 1950 AD .
Its old wall is witness to these days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of peace garden is drawing you .
As soon as you come inside the way you are welcomed , it is estimated by this that a lot of attention has been paid to the spiritual peace here .
Along with tying radish in the wrist mantra of Mangalachar is made to live .
We had reached at the slope of the evening and made a plan to set up this garden .
My host Jaiki who is a decorator specialist , is suddenly speaking this is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are impressed .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic , it was not surprising that Peace Bagh has also received prizes recently .
Manager arranged our program in the morning .
First of all a pedestrian journey with Rambabu and then a jeep safari of Bhangad .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Kaziranga where the light of the sun was gradually spreading .
Dry lake was seen in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rains , but first time we saw tobacco farming .
This glimpse of village life was a unique experience for Jaiki .
After this we reached Bhangadh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting closely .
This is a priceless bridge of millen dollars .
The way to say goodbye to Peace Bagh was also traditional Thagad and by opening curd they bid us farewell .
Now we came to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing triple life .
Is it right
And not only this happens in many states but tourists also show special interest in them .
These tourists are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this stay , food etc . are included .
This way there is an attempt to explore at such places , where there has not been much progress and where there has not been a special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides this , attention is also paid on not only doing traditional cuisine .
Actually the objective of such a tour is to make tourists communicate with the comfortable lifestyle and traditions of this place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tourists are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to distribute your favorite book .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with spending less time and giving enough time these tourists would definitely like to satisfy you .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is necessary to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign destination by bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking tickets .
Students , senior people of malaria , children , etc get discounts on them so there is a discount for two people as well .
Although buying tickets is cheap in advance , this is why it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moments that you plan a little before .
Find out about round trip instead of 2 Way Ticket .
It becomes lazy .
Taking bags are very strict and laws are strict therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be so that you have to leave some of your luggage on a terminal or you have to pay a different fee .
Also know the laws of insurance or compensation of losses from the tour company .
Carry on bags remain right , walk with them .
Because they come over the seat right in the rake .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage will be yours .
From where you have to take a bus , from there you reach an hour before time .
During emotional season you should take special care of this fact .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat you will have .
While choosing the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If there is too much shock on the last seat then the chair on the front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to go again and again , then take the seat of the corner and do not like to get overwhelmed , then the seat with the window will be better for you .
Now talking of a trick .
If you are in the clutches of both the palms then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is convenience of vapor in bus , then pay attention to this fact while liking the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are called to go out .
They don't take the responsibility of being on the bus because the settlements don't leave them during their time.
Wherever the bus stands , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then in your place a new traveller can be found and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see room in Europe then you did n't see anything .
The capital of Italy Rome is a fabulous city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its stuff .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those old cities of the world from where culture has developed .

This magnificent statue will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capital Line is also a different identity of this building .
A church museum and ancient temple is also built in Cape Valley Complex .
Symptoms of Rome are colossal .
The construction of this huge island was done in 80 years and 50 thousand visitors could sit here .
In colossal gallery i . . swordsmen used to show their performances .
They used to fight not only with each other but also with wild animals .
Whether it is from other swordsmen or from animals , these beatings of the heart go on till one of the warriors die .
In ancient Rome many forums were held .
Keep in mind that the place of burning sensation is called in Rome .
All the social , religious , economic , political etc activities of the city used to happen here .
Among these the most famous forum was Romani and the ruins of royal palace , temples and pillars are present even today at that place .

Statues of gods and goddesses are made all around the temple .
Incidentally in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although many gardens are gardens in Rome but Velaborguese is incomparable .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to this room .
You must go to the museum built here too , because after doing this you will miss the opportunity of being face to face with the best art works .
The idols made here are incomparable and appear as if they are going to speak now .

The main attractions of Rome are in its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which grand fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Triventin ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome , then he should be put in a coincidence fountain with this wish of Delhi .

Between the industrial area of Pampari and the place named Wakad located on the Pune - Bangalore highway , the double hotels of Ginger built on the way are equipped with all the modern facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra , Goa is brimming with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports , which is like a heaven for tourists , where one gets a glimpse of the gloriousness of ancient times from the tour of ancient churches .
Janjar Hotel situated in Goa ' s capital Panaji makes this journey extremely excellent .
Cycling on Goa ' s roads , resorts , cool sea winds and enjoying world famous dinner and living comfortable days Ginger Hotel situated here is the best option .
If seen in today 's history then for Maldives the cheapest person returns to Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Mall then you can get hotel in less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then your pocket will be reduced .
Sikrus prove to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise started the solitary secretariat of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is a coffee named village in Cruise and Hotel Buchar .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped its services right now , but from October it is expected that their boating will start .
Louis cruise ships can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at a cost of at least Rs . 5850 per person per night on an aquarium .
That is the fare of a person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two adults then the children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what to do .
Tea , breakfast , food are included in the rents of cruise .
Entertainment of all the time together .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from Siplenriding to Underwater Lunch .
If a sapling is standing in front of you while roaming in big airplanes then you will start feeling like a toy .
But this twelve - 15 seats is excellent for roaming in archipelago like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air while running like a speed boat on the surface of the water , one does not know .
In the entire flight you do not get to know the flights of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes are filled with windows -- seeing the blue water of different shades of Maldives , the islands of resorts and coral islands are worth seeing .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sapling companies in Maldives .
Transmal Devine is one of them , which has 20 saplings .
If you want then you can stroll for a flight of almost a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or you can rent the whole sapling for your entire day 's entertainment -LRB- pocket deep -RRB- .
Although if you go to an island far from Male island then the journey of Selene will be necessary because this is the only means of travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey whose ending will probably never make you feel like .
The journey of Siplin from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- excellent Maveliwar -RRB- is done in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and shower shops of the capital in the Ahmad Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening with great care to the speech delivered by the chief of Maldivian Maldivian Mohammad Nasheed in Copenhagen a day earlier in the General Assembly .
Believe me honestly that I have not seen any Indian listening to the president or prime minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land then it was so serious .
Many people might have thought the sitting inside the water through the cabin of Maldives in October , but if you go to Maldives then how impoverished would the world be if you had snatched it from the natural disaster .
There is something special about the beauty there .
In this small country such beauty does not combine .
From this stroll of the market to go back to its cruise , when we turned towards the jetty then suddenly we felt as if we were going in the water of the sea along with the road then we felt that to what extent does the people here understand the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of lamppost the fish swimming in depths of many metres was visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was totally contiguous with the city .
If you are able to see even a few centimetres clean in the water of the sea or river contiguous with any city of India then you will be able to find yourself fortunate .
Returning to M . . . Airlines spent two hours in Malley 's mind was roaming around .
Coral Rifles -LRB- Mongoose Cheetahs -RRB- is the life here .
Even the stones attached to your tombs will find pearls .
Some time before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his official residence .
There was no belief that far ahead of residence of the highest personality of any country there was no security worker .
Enjoying ourselves we were pulling gardens and explorations 50 metres away by raising our hands inside the gate of its bungalow .
Can you think so about the house of any Indian leader
When we got to know that two blocks ahead of us reached our office crossing the road on foot .
Every thing about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day uninterruptedly .
Allahabad was that day was going to be special .
A boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island in the morning .
From there we reached Maldives by cutting the circular path of the runway .
Last evening when we had reached near the cruise mall then we immediately recognized the saplings passing from above .
He had seen such pictures which he had seen .
But then there was no dearth that the next day there would be an opportunity for a ride in this .
We were going to Rangali Island a hundred and five kilometres away from Siplin of Transplant Diu .
Seeing hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from saplings flying till the height of about a thousand metres was unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a breathtaking flight with romance and passion .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Halton Hotlus on Rangali island it felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world whose external world was no less than an external world .
It was not even so much that it was difficult to enjoy the beauty there .
One can also walk on foot on the contrary or by a vehicle by a battery .
On both the sides of the bridge while going till the main island from Jetty the view of water life was unique .
Now we were unable to preserve ourselves from the nature of the surroundings , that such a place had reached , there was unparalleled humidity .
Climbing down several metres down from the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Across all the glasses we could see some strange types of small fish , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving .
The thought of eating while sitting on the tables decorated there was overwhelming in itself .
The fare of seeing this island on coming to Saplane from Malayalam and doing underwater lunch is only Rs . 47 thousand for a person .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to throw our passport in water .
But I knew , this was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with the same expectation that at times at some point of time we would surely bring him here .
For many days plans were made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this could not be possible .
If there was a hobby of wildlife since childhood then thought why should this time be gone to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking from Khardungla Pass in Ladakh till Kathgong lake .
On the morning of 27th December we set out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but the zeal that came out from here , the leopard gave us speed .
The journey between Happad and Gajraula was really tired .
The road from Upper to Kara and ahead .
Many a times it seemed as if it had fallen now .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhakali near the Park whose booking we had done earlier .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to visit beside Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we went out to the Corbett Museum which was near Dhangri Gate 2 kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening .
When we saw a lion roaming in the jungle then we kept on watching a lion throughout the night in a dream .
Amidst the depths of the night I suddenly heard a loud cry and after that the dogs who started roaming did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first consultation of turning black dhangi and carbohydrate came .
Kaladangi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett National Park falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladangi where some important things related to their life are kept .
Returning back I went for 12 and a half o'clock .
Kaladangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come and settled in this village .
On reaching the resort safari jeepsy was making arrangements for us .
It has been told that he has arranged for sighting in Site Bajrani there .
Asked about number one , there is greater grassland there and during this time tigers come towards that side to escape from cold .
Just as we reached Bajrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees to roam around four hours .
We went inside for the jungle .
We saw many kinds of animals and deer species there .
Inside we hired two tiny elephant rides , which had long teeth .
I did photography by collecting .
In the middle the guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide told that there are only around 150 tigers in the park out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but due to no sight of the tiger we were unable to see them .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind there was a ride of a tiger .
Then I remembered my old friend Haldwani .
I gave him such a phone .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He did n't see the tiger asked .
These words were pierced like arrows .
I gradually said , no .
There was no permission to carry baboons in the park .
Take that inside for the safari, the counsel you gave us.
