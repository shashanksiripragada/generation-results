Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On the one side of some side there is a mixture of both sinus and on the other side in Gujarat simultaneously .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
As such it is ' word ' , it does not have its own original form .
If you have to write something then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhoj is that wonderful city where many times the entire city has been devastated .
The tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very interesting .
If we return by the same route from where we had come then we will have to take a month 's leave and take a holiday and at some places the school will open in Mumbai .
So , what will you do now , by calling fast buses of Gujarat Tata , you will travel by train .
A small train of metre gauge from Bhoj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metre gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan 's architecture is passing through these two long distances .
Due to the increasing threats of world recession and south Asia the hustle-bustle of tourism has deepened .
From the point of view of tourism a considerable reduction has been brought in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan from the point of view of tourism .
The latest figures released by the Rajasthan government recently show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than 10 percent in comparison to the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of foreign tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 in Rajasthan a total of 2 . 98 crore 364 thousand 564 tourists came out of which 2 . 83 lakh 83 thousand 918 lakh Indians and 14 . 77 lakh foreign tourists were included , whereas during 2009 a total of 2 . 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In these 25558691 foreign tourists and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the area of tourism are very concerned about this situation .
The director of Rajput Damascus Vijayakosh of Rajput Helady Marcus says that the incidents of world recession and mishap have affected tourism badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not even create a strong structure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
The tourists of France are the most among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the present year has been the best for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , pools , jungles , everything is the same old for attracting tourists .
In the area of tourism the talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism increases but nothing has been done on that side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists the recent years in Rajasthan the observations of obstacles and obstacles have also kept the importance of this state on an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it remained confined to newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic infrastructure of tourism Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of lodging , commuting , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one dharamshala , one dharamshala and two Train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
In 2009 - 2008 the valley of RTDC remained 185 lac whose year 2009 - 2009 is expected to be 632 lac .
The condition of hotels in this corporation is this that even in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with the hotels other factories of the corporation are also reaching it in a big way .
Among these the main ones are the Royal Rajasthan of the Hills .
Tourists do not get attracted towards this train .
Despite losing their fares they did not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist villages made by RTDC , this year this number has decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the belief of RTDC is this that there has been no dearth of tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This train is continuously gaining profit .
Last year from this train RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees .
Worries of concern in the field of tourism are seen naturally from this fall in the area of tourism in the state of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of Rajasthan 's architecture .
If a person wants to do something in his heart then he can make sleep with soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled it by establishing a modern city Amboveli in the Saradhari mountain range of Maharashtra .

Behind the memorials of this idol and place many charming stories and old towns are famous .
The ruins of the palaces of Devi Pani are still singing the glorious songs of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi obtained from these remains is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .

During the time of the Chaitia kings in the mountains of north and south there was acceptance of this goddess till far .
The tribes here used to worship goddess .
The martyrdom of the humans was also given here due to which the king Raghunath Singh had stopped .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohat district of Arunachal .
They are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the midst of the Debang and Dibang rivers .
According to the popular towns here this place is the old Vidarbha , where at one time the royal family used to rule .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohat river , which is a major place of Lohat district .
The tribes of Deegro , Mysore etc . here show the way to travellers .
These people themselves have great respect for this lake .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Prasuram lake .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from afar come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in the district of Daidagoli are also very historical .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their stories .

We reach ero from four hours to four hours through the jeep from the city of Upper Assam , North - East .
This place is the headquarter of Laur Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the hearts of the people coming here .
This is that charming place where tourists live .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before becoming a path .
On reaching here high deodar trees , beautiful premieres , wild crafts , strawberries , and juicy scenes allure tourists .
Apples and walnuts are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kms .
This beautiful valley is the residing place of the tourists .
With their vigorous hard work your travellers have made it their heaven .
The cultivation of rice is very good here .
This place is the repository of rice .
This ten miles long rock is the living example of their labor and the achievement of farming .
Its climate is compensated by the Kali Nadi .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls just in the middle of the snowclad mountain ranges covered with the snow of the left hand on the peak on the slightest redness emanating in the sky .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the cool breeze blowing in the atmosphere one also gets the feeling of moisture .
From the sound of raw raw raw raw material below the legs one gets to see the layer of poultice laid on the wooden floor .
There is moisture in the air and nothing is visible because of the brightness before sunrise .
The sights are rested on the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on the bench lying in the balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the spinal cord shrinks with the sound of a mild crust and the hand separates with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of the life of Switzerland to come and spend the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneva or around it .
On both the sides of the river eating thin streams the dense population settled in the valley is spread on a very high slope .
This is the valley of Honey the main river of Switzerland on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
The charming road of the Ron river and the ringing carts on it have begun to appear clearly .
The journey of half an hour from a distance of 300 kilometres and a half an hour by car is found in Geneva lake and near a city named Rondie Montoro which is called French -LRB- Luckyma -RRB- along with half a ropeway .
300 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide is situated Geneva city at the western end of this lake .
From there the lake again moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
Crossing the city through a beautiful valley named Leuk we leave this highway on the left side , come to the north on the mountainous path .
Due to the slope of the mountain being towards the south the evening sun is giving complete sunlight to the corner .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less , almost equal .
Jeans move towards height , amount of snow starts increasing .
Despite good snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular mountainous road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal -LRB- Hel -RRB- .
There are many big storied bungalows with slopy roofs , completely made of wood .
In the basement made from the cement concrete of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , laundry along with the parking of vehicles .
Wildlife Sanctuary is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This wine is a special center of making grapes .
On 37  land part of the entire cantonment is the field of grapes .
The gardens of grapes in the village based on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a unique experience to the beauty there .
Taking till the gardens of grapes -LRB- Lineards -RRB- , taking rest in the night in the village there and taking them to the intoxicated liquor shops is an integral part of the tourist beauty here .
There is a very big museum of grapefruits in a small town named Aizawl built in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to first bouquet .
Once again we pass through the deserted jungle .
Mind becomes even worse by the pungent questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kilometres .
Suddenly a thrilling and charming change comes in the sight by a bend .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley towards the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the Spot Slope from the top of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of Upper mountain from the skiing slope .
Snow has fallen on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses of the village are shining due to the presence of direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reached Us village .
Here also the same fashion is spread .
All around there is a government of dusty snow from the peak of the mountain till the bank of the valley .
Within the next five minutes we reach the middle of this town by a large circular fountain -LRB- roundabout -RRB- .
The name of the colony is Leukarbad .
The population of Laukarbad located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , travellers and acquaintances coming here can be estimated from the fact that there are 1700 apartments and shilaets -LRB- 1500 -RRB- hotels for staying here , camping sites of Tamboo , centres of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
So far 65 sips of hot water has been found in Lakshadweep .

Reaching the village one feels a complete heat .
The thick layer of snow above the roof of the house is sparkling in the scorching sunshine .
Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- is of this village .
Bahrain village is one of the preserved places in Switzerland in the form of a legacy of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that in Sikkim the taxis of surf-silk can be done only hence there is no checking .
The journey continues , but the hill is the same , the trees and plants are the same , the same is the circumstance .
The moisture present on the whole body is the same .
In the season of rains surmai oozla is the same .
With the completion of the program of Darjeeling journey the decision to take the decision of Kurseing was first taken .
Crossing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea estates , full of sunny jungles .
Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary is near the Idukki dam .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then the tea garden initially welcomes the people moving towards it .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens attracts the heart in the first time itself .
On one side green mountains lying filled with jungles , on the other side deep greenery .
Sometimes the jungles here and there sometimes tea gardens are visible .
There was the rule of greenery on the four sides .
Once upon a time I got dried up , seeing these natural jungles or planting tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful was the jungle , the more beautiful is the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you look at the roads on the way then it seems strange .
The snake charmer was lying flat and narrow .
Time was also passing .
It was not passing , then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes a small settlement is seen .
From a distance only a hill house and house appeared very dense .
This was Kursing .
After staying at a place here we made a program of roaming the whole day .
Then taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Crossing .
First of all darbar park .
A small garden is surrounded by thick forests on all four sides .
Upper i . . to reach the deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being immersed in the beauty of Crossing the beauty of Crossingha has not yet been found to be famous in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very high and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the lure of reaching till the deer park surrounded by jungles and the chance of climbing the path between the sunshine trees was giving us comfort .
The next place was Egggrade .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is also called Swiss side point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to live by jumping from here .
Currently this is decorated with a park and restaurant .
There is a staircase here , with the height of which a beautiful view of the whole city comes in front .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea leaves running very fast on the back with a binoculars .
There is a museum outside the Crossing city , but that day we can not go there , because it is necessary to tour the pleasant environment of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was a charming experience in itself , but it was a big worry as to how would we roam if it rained .
But the surprising thing was that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed the sunrise .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more attractive than this .
On moving a little more than here we got ghera gangamaya from the hills .
Here amidst rocks the mirror of waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls in the reign of rocks and rocks are iron then in Gangamaya the circumference of waterfalls in the world is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are located quite below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Baisia loop in Darjeeling by climbing up with the help of a car .
From here the whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durban .
The climate was alpine till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we come down and shine .
Make a program of strolling and shopping at the mall road in the evening .
In the tour of Darjeeling the toy train starts roaming in the journey .
The journey of tour from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and from Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Maryak lake and a little rest in the garden here .
From this route only tourists go to Pashupatinath bazaar , where sweaters made by the hand of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its face is different .
Here not the greenery of tea gardens but the habitation of forests and waterfalls is happening .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which is filled with forest waterfalls .
But in scarcity of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had just come to Darjeeling from Kolkata .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and adventurous .
This journey was neither of a foreign country nor of outside Rajasthan , but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself , in which sometimes travels towards itself , some special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like Gulabbagiri or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to know of it .
The place where I am going to talk , that place has been prepared approximately four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come here , it has really burnt in the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears my guide resonates with Rambabumana , but before that we could not even imagine that we could live like this in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Rambabu the resident of Bastar used to work in Jaipur before this and now it is in this unique royal palace .
He has embraced his own words in a new color .
It is the style of Shahjahan empire .
Nobody calls you English there .
Shanti Bagh in reality is a tourist spot of peaceful China and complete Sikh convenience .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it will engage you in the region nearby .
Of the people passing the holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people will have to go for a tour of Bhangra . Go away , among the people of Jaipur , some may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of the Shanti Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night also when Samadhishwar had called me there with a loud heart , but I had not gone there .
It is a different matter that he himself had gone to Mandhavgarh by wandering on his own .
This time when suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in a short span of time they should definitely go to Shantibagh .
This garden is protected from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to run for hunting .
Its construction took place in sixteenth century .
Its old walls are the witnesses of these days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Shanti Bagh draws you .
As soon as you come in the way you are welcomed , it seems that here spiritual peace has been given great attention .
Along with tying roots in Kali the Mantra of Mangalore is celebrated with fervor .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we made a plan to plant this garden .
My wife J . . , who is a decorative expert , uttered suddenly , that is interesting .
All are influenced by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything new but artistic . No wonder that Shanti Bagh has received the award recently .
The manager decided our program to do the morning .
First of all a walk with Rambabu and then a jeep journey of Bhangra .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Kathgodam on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which peasants were cultivating .
This year it did n't rain but for the first time a farm of tobacco was seen .
For J . . such a glimpse of the life of the village was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangra from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist from Holland in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable bridge of million dollars .
Even the traditional way of saying goodbye to the peace gardens was bad and by giving curd they bargained us .
Now I understood why tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal Life .
Is this right .
But it is not so in many states and tourists also show immense interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this stale , food etc . are also included .
In this way an attempt is made to face such places where very much development has not taken place and the lifestyle of nature and people have not been affected much .
At the same time old tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this paying attention to tridental consciousness is also given .
Actually the purpose of such tours is to make the tourists aware of the ways and means of living of this place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
Despite having a lot of people with it you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to your favorite book making a disturbance .
Yes , it is necessary that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace this tour will surely satisfy you .
This is the reason that for enjoying them it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching foreign destinations by bus .
Find a best deal before taking a ticket .
Scientists , senior citizens of the media , children etc get a discount on them , then there is a discount on them for two people as well .
However , buying tickets in advance is cheap , so it is better to feed bus tours in the last moments that you do planning a little ahead .
Instead of two wheelers get to know about round trips .
This falls inexpensive .
The rules taking the bagge are very tough , therefore enquire about the size and weight of the goods .
Somewhere it should not be that you have to leave some of your things on the terminal or you have to pay a different fee .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation of loss from tour company .
Careful onion bags stay right , take them away .
Because they come properly in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of the goods will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During a passionate season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach the better settlement will be with you .
While choosing the set keep in mind comfortable things .
If the jerks on the back seat will be more then the seats ahead will not be comfortable .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be overwhelmed , then the window set will be better for you .
Now there is talk of a trick .
If you are in a position to hold both , then sit on the seat below the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is the facility of washroom in the bus then while liking the seat also keep this thing in mind , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identification of bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its grave the bus do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then at your place you can find a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus on terminal .

Amidst the Pampri Industrial Region and at a place named Wakad situated on Pune - Bangalore highway the Generator 's Doon hotels are equipped with all modern facilities .
The neighbor state of Maharashtra Goa is laden with its beautiful sea shores and different water sports , which is like a heaven for tourists where one gets a unique view of ancient times from the tour of ancient church .

Skiing on Goa ' s roads , river cruise , cold sea climate and Ginger Hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend a comfortable day enjoying world famous Goan food .
In today 's history the cheapest person for Maldives earns 28 thousand rupees per person .
After this if you stay in Malayala Kalagramam then you can find hotels in a very less rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the actual beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Sycrose proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Loui cruise from Kochi started the single series of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is a very village named in Cruise and Hotel Beapour .
Although because of some problems Louis Cross has stopped his services yet , but there is a possibility of his sugar starting from October .

That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two years are old then the child below 15 years is absolutely free .
And should be done .
Tea , breakfast , food are included in the cruise fares .
With the entertainment of all the time .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives in accordance with your pocket - from seaplane riding to sealed underwater litch .
If a plane stands in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like toying .
But this tincture of 12 - 15 seats is excellent for touring Archipeligues like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boot on the surface of water , it does not know .
In the entire flight you do not have the idea of the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Your waves keep on flowing through the windows all the time - watching the blue waters of different shades of Maldives , different reserve islands and coral islands .
How clear is everything looks .
There are only two sapling companies in Maldives .
Transplant god is one of them with 20 saplings .
If you want you can roam around for an hour in approximately a thousand rupees -LRB- approximately a hundred rupees -RRB- per person or you can take the entire supplement for an entertainment throughout your day -LRB- the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from Male Island then the journey to Selene will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is one such journey whose end will probably never make you feel like .
The journey from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- excellent Mavilivaro -RRB- of Seplain takes place on the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and Shownier shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Malaysia .
All the salesmen were listening very carefully to the reports made in Copenhagen -LRB- Copenhagen -RRB- by the chief minister of Maldives one day before .
Saying sincerely , I have not seen any Indian listening to the president or chairmanship so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a rare creation of that period then it was so important .
Several people might have understood the deterioration of the water sitting inside by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but Maldives might well have gone to Maldives that if natural disasters were to take them away from us then how much would the world have lost .
In the beauty there such a thing is very special .
Such beauty does not disappear in this small country .
When we turned towards Jetty to go back to our cruise from this tour of the market , then suddenly when we went in the water of the sea along with the road then we realized how far the people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of leopard fishes floating in depths of several metres were seen all along with their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely settled from the city .
You will find yourself lucky if you can see some centimetres clean in the water of sea or river connected with any city of India .
The evening spent in Malayalam while returning to Empowerment was roaming around in two hours .
Coral reef -LRB- Mungachatta -RRB- is the life here .
You will also find mugs on the stones attached to the graves here .
We were standing outside their official residence a little before the hearing of President Nashad .
We did n't believe that there was no security worker till far ahead of the residence of any country 's higher education .
Interestingly we were pulling the bugyals and bugyals 50 metres away by spreading the hand inside the gate of its bugyal .
Can you think this about the house of any faithful leader of India
Even then it came to be known that once the chief minister crossed the road on foot and two blocks ahead reached his office .
Everything about Maldives was thrilling .
That is why I had to wait for the next day uninterrupted .
It was obvious that the day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to Airport Island from Cruise .
From there we reached on the base of Train Maldives crossing the cycle of the ropeway .
Next evening when the cruise was reaching near the Mall , then we immediately recognized the slippers passing from above .
Such pictures which were seen , are of it .
But then there was no pride that next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We were about to go to Rangli Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the Saplin of Transplant Dev .
Seeing the hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives was unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a romantic and emotional breathing breeze .
But on reaching the Corradges Fort of Hulton Hotles on the colorful islands it felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world , outside which there was no relation between any world .
It was not even like this that the beauty of that place would have been difficult to get out .
Tour on Konark can be done on foot as well or by a train running from the battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was unique .
Now we were unable to conserve ourselves with the natural beauty of the surroundings , it had reached such a place , had become unforgettable .
Coming down several metres down the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Throughout the glasses on all sides we could see strange types of small fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
There the thought of eating while sitting on fixed tables was in itself a bit fascinating .
Coming to see this island from Malaysia and doing underwater lunch is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to float in our passport water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with the same hope that sometimes , sometimes on some turn we will surely bring the message here .
Since many days we were planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
If you were fond of wildlife from childhood then why not think that this time you will go to Jim Corbett .
This was the second bike tour after the biking of Laddakh in 2006 from Khurdungla Pass till Kaziranga lake .
In the morning of 27 December we set out for Jim Corbett with comfort , but the passion that had come out of miracles , uickly gave our speed a frozen reflection .
The journey between Hapad and Gajraula was really tired .
From Upper to Kira and ahead bad roads .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhakili near the park , which we had already got bucking done .
This day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was near Dhangdi Gate , 2 kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went to roam around Ramnagar .
It was late evening while returning .
I was stunned that if I see lions roaming in the jungle then I would see lions in dreams all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night I suddenly heard a lot of curse and after that the dogs start bursting and do not stop for two hours .
Therefore it came to pass in the first instance that the advice of roaming black pepper and carbonate fall came .
Kaladangi is thirty kilometres away while on the way to Corbett National Park it falls .
There is a museum of the Jim Corbett National Park in Kala Dungi , where some important items related to their life are kept .
Returning we went back 12 and a half o'clock .
Kaladangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Jupsi was waiting for us .
It is said that he has got an arrangement of skiing in the number one September market there .
On asking about number one said that Garland is more there and tigers come towards it to prevent winters .
On reaching Bajrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We went inside for a jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we sprinkled two towers of elephant , which had long teeth .
I got a photography done after getting stuck .
In the meantime the guide started trekking for the tiger .
The guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , out of which leopards have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but were excited about the absence of a visit to the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I had a guide of tiger in my mind .
Then Mughal Emperor Haldwani remembered one of his old friends .
I started calling him the same .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He did n't see the tiger asked .
This edict is like a swimming pool .
I said gradually .
There was no permission to take rest in the park .
Somebody advised us to take the safari inside.
