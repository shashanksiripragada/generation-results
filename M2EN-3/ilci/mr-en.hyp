Its language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other hand there is a mixture of both in the language of Gujarat .
This is called kachchi .
As such this is ' dialect ' , it does not have any such script of its own .
If you want to write kutchi then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Anjar is just near Bhuj where several times earthquakes occurred and the whole city got destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisalmer .
The talk of Jasal-Tural is very entertaining .
If we come to Maghar by the same route through which we have come then we will have to leave for another month and schools will start there in Mumbai .
So what to do . Now let us travel by train after commuting fast trains of Gujarat .
A small rail of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there one more small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
Tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad situations these days .
Due to global recession and the increasing threat of South Asia the tourism industry has suffered a serious setback .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan among the major states of the country has been registered at this time .
According to the figures recently announced by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent compared to 2008 years .
According to statistics number of national tourists decreased by 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included while in 2009 total 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 national and 10 lakh 73 thousand and 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
The director of Hollywood Makers in Rajput Sanjay Kaushik says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected tourism business .
Comparing with other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong base of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent in the last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has remained good for the past few years .
This is the first time after 2002 when the number of tourists decreased in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing like this happens .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , wilderness , everything is old to see tourists .
With regard to rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism all governments do a lot of things in the area of tourism but nothing can be done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
Together with this the state has been spotted on international level by the incidents of rape and shedding on foreign women tourists .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism to industry a long time ago in this state but it remained limited to papers .
Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 with the goal of enhancing tourism and developing the basic nature of tourism in Rajasthan .
This institute provides facilities like residence , food , communication , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 divisions of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one component of communication and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but for a few years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lac which is likely to be 632 lac in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years in its hotels 40 percent rooms have not been filled .
Along with hotels other components of the organization are also harming it .
Among these the major ones are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There can not be any attraction among tourists regarding this railway .
By decreasing the fare also this could not attract the tourists .
Likewise in the present year tourists have become angry with regard to many fairs .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair the tourist village constructed by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year there has been a fall in this number and it is 217 .
The most satisfying thing about this RTDC is that there is no dearth of tourist attraction for Palace on Wheels i . . Shahi train .
This vehicle is becoming profitable .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
This recession occurring in the area of tourism in Rajasthan is natural for anxiety in tourism .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can take out the gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has exhibited this by setting up modern city Ambo Vali in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
Those dreams which he had dreamt , seeing them progressing day by day , he feels happy in their eyes .
His joy was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres there are only 9 percent restaurants , houses and other facilities on the ground .
91 percent land has been provided with trees , lakes , fields , fountains and other facilities .
Many entrepreneurs came forward to build their homes in this city built for crores of people and today there are around 800 families living in this city .
Initially entrepreneurs and architects bought their Asiatics in the form of holiday home but now they have made it their home and do the work of traveling to Mumbai .
Behind Amby Valley is Koyarigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
The ruins of Leekawali in West Siang district are very important .
The ruins of a large temple have been discovered while digging .
On the stone pillars of this temple the carvings of lotus and gods - goddesses have been done which are very fragmented .
Malini Than is an important place of this very area .
On this spot a ten-sided idol of Goddess Durga is established .
Behind the renaming of this idol and place in the residents here many sweet stories and ancient stories are popular .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruin is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient tales the description of the importance of Tamreshwari goddess is found .
During the reign of Chetia kings in north - east mountains this goddess had a distant belief .
The tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Hunting of humans was also done here which later on was closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other remains have been found in Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is said to be the ruins of Bhishmak city which is situated in the landmass between the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the famous heroic stories here this place is an old sculpture where once King Bhishma had ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tourists like Digru , Mishmi etc . guide the tourists here .
These people themselves also have great faith in this Kunda .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
Devotees from far off places come here on the occasion of Makar Sankranti .
Besides the above mentioned ruins in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the remains of Roing in the Diwang-Villa district are also historically important .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roeing are still telling their story .
The ghats of bathing , pucca living and being surrounded by firm edges of other ponds and getting the ruins of wide roads are still singing the silent songs of our ancient grand heroic story .
From the city of north Lakhimpur of upper Assam we reached ero in four hours by jeep .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place captivates the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where people of Aptani community live .
It took many days to reach here before the jeep was made road .
On reaching here the views of trees of high deodar , beautiful premrose , vaolet , wild current , strawberries and raceberries overwhelm the people .
There are many products of apple and apricot .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of its own people .
With their untiring efforts their own people have made it their heaven .
Cultivation of rice is very high here .
This place is the store of rice .
This ten miles long rope is a living example of their hard work and cultivation .
The necessity of irrigation of black river Mulas , is fulfilled .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The vision emerges from the sky on the horizon amidst the snow laden mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
One also gets the feeling of loose motions along with the cool breeze touching the environment .
The sound of garbage under the feet is seen on the layer of leaves laid on the floor of the wood .
There is dullness in the atmosphere and much was visible before sunrise because of the sunset spreading .
The eyesight stays blooming on the redness of the east .
I felt like sitting down the benches lying in balcony .
The layer of snow gets stuck on the roll of hands with a sound of light sound and the hand gets shaken with a feeling of cold .
This is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village based amidst snow laden hills of Switzerland thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third journey to Swiss .
Before this very long time was spent in or around Jeneba .
On both the sides of the shallow Balkhati river a dense village based in the valley is spread up to a great extent on a light slope .
This is the main river Rhone of Switzerland on both the sides of which are settled many small towns .
Highways parallel to the Ron river and the vehicles running on them are clearly visible .
At a distance of 300 kms and a journey of two and a half hours is half way and along with the Geneva lake and half Ron river near the city named Montreux the Ron river coming from east meets the Geneva lake which is called as Lec Lemon -LRB- Lock Lamon -RRB- .
Geneva city is located on the western end of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there after becoming a river again the lake moves westwards .
On the right side beside the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we come by the mountainous roads of north leaving this highway on the left side .
Because of the slopes of the mountains being towards south the sun sets in the evening in abundance .
The amount of snow less than the valley - almost not right here .
As the height moves towards the direction , the density of the snow has started increasing .
There is no special cold in the air because of the clear sky and the shining sun on both the sides of the road .
After covering a distance of approximately 20 k . . on this circular mountainous juice in half an hour we reached a small village named Thel .
Chalet -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - Descending roof , full of wooden huge multi-storied bungalows are there .
In the grooves built with the cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , landery etc . along with parking of vehicles .
Valai is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of grapes making garlic .
Farming of grapes takes place on 37  of the total area of Canton .
The gardens of grapes in the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley give a magnificent dimension to the beauty there .
To take wine yards to the base of the grapes , to roam around them , to relax at night in the villages there and to make them taste the wine tasting by taking them to the factories of grapes are the integral parts of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aizawl in a small fort made in the 12th century a huge museum of liquor made of grapes is there to see which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we go through that jungle passing through Dwanal .
The mind gets even more distraught by the querying questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
Suddenly a dramatic and charming change comes from the viewpoint of a sight .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the slope above the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the flat slope situated in the upper part of the village .
From Skiing Slope to the mountain top dense forest of Deodar is spread .
Snow has fallen all around .
The roof of the houses of the settlements is sparkling due to the direct rays of the sun falling .
We reach that village in five storeys .
Peace is spread here as well .
All around there is a kingdom of snow laden from the top of the mountain to the valley .
Inside the next five minutes you reach a big round wheel in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The estimate of the number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 sadnikas and shales with a capacity of 6900 beds . 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants for staying .
So far 65 sources of hot water has been found in Luckerbad .
40 lakh litres -LRB- up to 51OC -RRB- water coming out of it is taken to the Thermal Pools around 30 small and big towns , some bridges are inside the five starred hotel and others according to the economic level of the people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
A huge layer of snow is shining on the roofs of the houses in the lush green sunshine of the trunk .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village , in Switzerland it is one of the conservation places in the form of national heritage .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can go only by taxi , therefore checking is not possible .
The journey is on , the region may be another , but the mountains are same , the trees are same , the sloping wind is same .
The wet cloth that blows the whole body is that itself .
In the season of monsoons the weather is bright and sharp .
The plan of Darjeeling tour was fixed and it was decided to take a glimpse of Kurseong first .
Kurseong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of smoke jungles .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move ahead from Siliguri towards Darjeeling then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming towards us .
Going by the road passing through the tea gardens hypnotise the mind in the first time .
On one side is a green mountain full of forests , on the other side a deep green valley .
Sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens were visible here .
All around there was a green kingdom .
Once upon a time I got scared to see these natural jungles that look at the plants of tea plantations planted by humans .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
As beautiful a forest was the tea garden spread far and wide .
If we look at the roads on the roads then it seems marvellous .
The curved and curved ways used to move ahead like a snake 's bed .
The time was also clear .
If we could not finish it would be a jungle and tea garden .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From far off places a mountainous house - house looks very dense .
This happens to be Karsiyang .
Staying here in one place we made the program of touring the whole day .
Therefore taking a train we left for a picnic of Kurseong .
Deer park first .
A small garden is surrounded by huge forests on all the four sides .
To reach the deer park the train had to be left very low .
Kurseong despite being full of beauty has not been able to develop in the form of a tourist spot .
While the city is very good and clean .
Despite the lack of roads reaching till the deer park surrounded by forests the greed of reaching through the trees of smoke and the joy of climbing the road was giving us the adventure .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that in the time of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
At present there is a park and hotel here .
There is a genetic dome here from the heights of which on observing the whole city a beautiful sight is formed .
In the tea gardens nearby women were engrossed in breaking the tea leaves by pressing a cap on their backs .
There is a museum outside Kurseong city but that day we could not go there because it seemed necessary to roam around in the unfathomable environment of tea gardens .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was a matter of great concern that if such rains continue then how will we roam around
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we enjoyed the blooming sunshine .
This park is a beautiful place very attractive with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful .
After walking a little more down from here the Ganges got surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls located in the rocks here is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that the waterfalls in the empire of rocks are very beautiful here and Ganga maya is adorned with the grandeur of waterfalls .
Both these places are located very low in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia Loop in Darjeeling rising up with the help of a train .
The whole of Darjeeling mountain and city can be seen from here on the basis of binoculars .
The waves of the weather were clean till now .
But as we went towards the monastery we did n't know where we came and started sparkling .
In the evening there was a plan of roaming and shopping in Malrod .
In Darjeeling toy train enhances the beauty of the journey .
The journey from Darjeeling to Ghoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and halt in the park .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar through this route , where sweater etc . are found wrapped with the help of Nepali artisans .
There is also arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its colors and shapes are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but there is an abundance of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lap and Lolegaon , which are full of forest - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had just come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadow of cold but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here kept me tied with you .
A small journey of my present was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither from a foreign country nor from outside Rajasthan but from Jaipur very near .
Tourism is an attractive topic in itself in which the journey sometimes draws towards itself , while sometimes it is a special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like Pink City or Lake Palace in Udaipur .
People get attracted to some special attraction .
The place I am going to talk about is prepared only about four and a half years back , but with the preparation this place has come there , that is why they did the good of the forest .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide in my ear rings the word Rambabu Meena . Even before this , we could not even imagine that we could stay in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did n't get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in Aman Bagh of this unique royal style .
He brought his own conversation to a new color .
Sahiba ' is an estimate of Aman Bagh .
Nobody speaks to you English language there .
Aman Bagh is actually a peaceful and peaceful picnic spot .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it should also introduce itself to the nearby areas .
In the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people would have spent the night in that area to go to Kashla , from the residents of Jaipur .
After the opening of Aman Bagh large numbers of people from within the country and outside had reached there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azami had told me there with heart but I could not go .
It 's a different matter that he had himself reached Bhangad after quitting .
On this occasion when suddenly I reached there my companion of my foreign guests then it felt as if people want to spend a good holiday in less time then he must go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden out of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp to hunt .
Its construction was done in 1121 AD .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Bagh attracts you .
The way you enter inside , the way you are welcomed , that is why attention has been paid to the divine peace here .
In Mangat along with tying apricot the chanting of Manglacharan Manglachar is done with eternal pronunciation .
We had reached at the end of the evening and decided to kill that garden all around .
My host Jackie , who is a decorator , can easily say , This is charming .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
It is all new but artistic , it is not surprising that Aman Bagh has also received the award at present .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangad .
While walking on narrow roads we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the rays of the sun were spreading gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rains but first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie there was such a unique experience of rural life .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Just in the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting close to me .
These are invaluable moments of billion dollars .
The method of bidding farewell of Aman Garden was also traditional which gave us leaves by feeding jaggery and curd .
Now we came to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that a tour package is kept to see the life of the tribe .
Is it right
No doubt and such happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this stay , food etc . are included .
In such a situation an attempt is made to find such a place , where there has not been much development and where there has not been any special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At that time only where old tourist places etc are also present .
Besides this , attention is also paid on doing all the tridial cuisines .
Actually the purpose of such tour was to make the tourists aware of the life style and traditions of that place .
Actually this idea seems a bit difficult , but such tours are really attractive and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
With this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone despite being with people for a long time .
Not only this , in this journey you can give more time without interfering in books of your choice .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with spending less and providing enough time these tours definitely keep on expecting patience from you .
This is the very reason that it is necessary to keep in mind some things for enzymes , specially when you see a foreign destination with the help of a bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , seniors of the military , children etc get suits on these , while there is arrangement for giving suits for two people as well .
It is cheap to buy advance tickets , therefore in the last moment plan is better than bus tours .
In place of two way ticket keep in mind the subject of round trip .
These become cheap .
Rules regarding baggage are very strict therefore think about the size and weight of the luggage .
It should never happen that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you will have to pay more fee .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , go on taking them .
Because they sit together in the rock on this seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of the luggage is yourself .
From where you want to take a bus , from there reach an hour before time .
During the busy season you pay special attention to these things .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better you will have the option of seating .
Keep in mind whether it is pleasant to choose a seat or not .
If you sit at the back seat then reading at the front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take the seat of the elbow and do not like more obstacles , then the seat of the window will be good for you .
Now there is a talk of one fourth .
If both of you are thinking of splitting then first sit on the seat of the elbow and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then while choosing the seat keep in mind that it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Make the identity of the bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because when they lose they do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time then your place can be found by another person and you will have to wait for the bus .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe then you did n't see anything .

Certainly this will show you a different world view and will give you a memorable experience .

The Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option to enjoy cycling , reverse cruise , cold sea wind and world famous Goan food substances on the roads of Goa .
Today on the date the fare for returning to every individual inexpensive from Delhi for Maldives is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Male you can also find hotels on less fare but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be a bit smaller .
C cruise only proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started the sole cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis Cruise has now postponed his service , but it is likely to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least Rs . 5850 every night on the vessel MV Aquarin of Louis cruise .
That means the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two adults then complete freedom for children less than 15 years of age .
What more needs .
Tea , snacks , meals are included in the rent of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a plane stands in front of you while jumping in the big aeroplanes then you will feel like a game .
But with 12 - 15 seats this Tiwan Oter plane is undisputed for roaming in the island of Maldives .
He does n't even know that while running on the surface of water like speed boat it starts flying in the air .
In the entire journey we do not feel the journey of ordinary planes .
Our eyes are constantly moving beneath the windows with different views of blue water of Maldives , Neelkurinji islands and coral islands .
Everything looks so clean .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies which has 20 planes .
If you want then you can take a flight of around 4 thousand rupees -LRB- everybody -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire plane with your own control on rent -LRB- just be full of pockets -RRB- .
If we go to an island separate from Male island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on different islands .
And this is such a journey that we will not feel like ending .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- north Maveliwaru -RRB- in Maldives Island .
We were in the most ancient and Sovenier shops of the capital in the Ahmedabad market of Male .
All the sellers listen to the address delivered by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
If I tell you honestly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speech of the President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But the question of the existence of a supernatural object on this earth was so adventurous .
Many people might have understood this meeting held by the Cabinet of Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it feels that if you take it away from yourself by the wrath of nature then the world will be lost .
There is something special in its beauty .
There is not so much beauty in that small country .
After that journey of the market while returning to the port for going back to the cruise if your eyes go in the waters of the sea then it feels as if the people here do so much of beauty .
The water was so clean that in the light of the lamppost swimming fishes were seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see a few centimetres in the waters of the sea or rivers near any city of India then you will find yourself fortunate .
While returning from M . . . Aquarius the evening spent in Male was mesmerising .
Coral rock -LRB- munga rock -RRB- is the life here .
So much that we will get to see mung rocks on the stones of the tombs .
After listening to the speech of President Nasheed for some time we were standing outside his government residence .
It did n't seem like that we were standing outside the residence of one of the highest personalities of the country and there was no protector at a distance .
We were enjoying taking pictures of gardens and fountains just fifty metres long by hand inside the door of their bungalows .
Can you think of a leader in India
This was also understood that President sometimes walking on foot crossing both his houses ahead reach his office .
Everything related to Maldives was enhancing curiosity .
That is why I kept waiting for the next day .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a name from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we made a round of runway and trained on the base of Maldives .
Last evening when cruise reached near Male then we immediately recognized the plane going from above .
We had seen so many photographs of them .
But then it was not imagined that the next day there would be an opportunity to roam around .
By the sea plane of Tross Maldives we had to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres long .
Seeing hundreds of monasteries and coral islands spread on the seashore of Maldives by the sea plane flying at a height of about thousands of metres is unforgettable .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
There was an unusual flight of breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konark of Hilton Hotel in Rangali island it felt as if we have reached in a different world .
In such a world which has nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such relation that getting the beauty and comfort of that place was not possible .
The journey of Konark can also be done on foot or by a battery or a car .
The scene of water on both the sides of the bridge going from the port to the main island is marvellous .
Now if we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place which was incredible .
While descending down to the sea by several metres from the shafts in the water below the sea we went into such a glass room which was in water .
Our room was mainly a dining room .
Across the glass we were able to see different types of small fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving men .
The idea of eating while sitting on the table was very thrilling .
The expense of a person coming from Male to see this island by sea plane and taking lunch inside water is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passports in water .
But it was known that this was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with this hope that we would sometimes take our luck back to this place .
For many days it was decided to go away from Delhi but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
There was an interest in wildlife since childhood , then thought that this time Jim Corbett should not be visited .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking from the Pegong lake near Khardungla in Ladakh .
On 27 o'clock in the afternoon we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement in which we had come out that our speed was blown by the storm .
The journey from Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Wash it from the top and bad road from the front .
Many a times it felt that now it has fallen .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We arrived at Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our rendezvous was passing through the park which we had registered earlier .
That day there was no special program and despite being cold we went to visit the shore of Kosi first .
After spending two - three hours we went out to see the Corbett Museum situated near Dhangri Gate at a very far distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to see Ramnagar below .
It was very late in the evening while returning .
While getting out of Delhi we decided that the lion roaming freely in the jungle will definitely see why all night I was seen lions .
In the darkness of the night I heard suddenly loudly and after that dogs started roaming like that which did not stop for two hours .
Initially Kaldhungi and Corbett waterfalls were to be seen .
Kalatungi is 30 kilometres away and Corbett Fall is on the way .
In Kalatungi there is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb where some important items related to his personal life are kept .
It was half past twelve till return .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place the Jim Corbett had come and settled in this village .
On reaching the resort safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It is said that he has arranged for sighting in the Sight Bijrani of one of the numbers there .
On asking about one number it was said that there is more greenery and tigers come to that place to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees to roam around for four hours .
We went inside for the jungle .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
We saw two tusked elephants inside which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide said that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park out of which some have died .
At some places we also saw the ruins of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tiger .
The third day we had to return to Delhi .
The wad of a tiger was filled in my head .
Then I remembered one of my friends of Haldani .
I called him like that only .
I told him that I had come in carbot .
Whether he saw the tiger asked or not .
His words are like arrows .
I said gradually , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone told us that you take a safari to go inside .
