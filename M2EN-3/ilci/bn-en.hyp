Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yeah, different.
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat , that is why there are mixtures of both in language .
This language is called Kuchi .
However there is no script in this language .
If you want to write Kutchi then you will have to write it in Gujarati script .
Near the ground is that Anjar city where several times earthquakes took place and the entire city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar itself .
The stories of Jaisalmer are very exciting .
If we want to return by that route then we will have to take another one month 's holiday and on the other side the school will open in Bombay .
Then what can be done  Now we will take the train by taking the buses of Gujarat in a hurry .
Small trains of metre gauge reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there another train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad situations nowadays .
Due to the fear of depression and increase in South Asia tourism has been profoundly impacted .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan tourism counted in the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the recent numbers issued by the Rajasthan Government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is 10 percent less in comparison to 2008 .
According to the number the number of national tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 there were a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 were national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists , in comparison to this a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
Director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to the incidents of trade recession and terror the tourism industry has been affected badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop and develop strong fundamentals in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is the maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has been spent quite a lot .
For the first time since 2000 the number of tourists in Rajasthan has reduced .
Nothing is happening from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , palace , fort , pond , forest everything has been kept in the old condition for tourists .
To work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the area of tourism all the governments are comprehensive but nothing has been done here .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get less facilities .
Along with foreign tourists the incidents of rape and disturbance happening in Rajasthan in the past few years have also spoiled the pictures of this state at an international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry to the state several years ago but it was limited to newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of a success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism .
The Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1947 with the goal of developing the infrastructure of tourism and tourism infrastructure in Rajasthan .
The facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . is available for the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units in this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one passenger single and two travellers Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has worsened for a few years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was Rs . 185 lakh which was estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel condition of this Nigam is such that even in the last five years forty percent houses of this hotel are not filled .
Along with the hotel the other islands of Nigam have also faced big losses .
The main among these are the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this railway .
Even after decreasing the fares this could not attract the tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair is less .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair in the form of RTDC there were 398 foreign tourists in the tourist villages where this year the number has decreased to 217 .
The satisfaction of RTDC among all these is that Palace on Wheels i . . the attraction of tourists towards the royal train has shown some deficiency .
There is uninterrupted benefit by this railway .
In the past year RTDC has achieved nine and a half crore rupees in this railway .
In the area of tourism in Rajasthan being disturbed due to this loss is natural .
Tourism is the biggest festival of Rajasthan economy .
If there is desire to do something in the mind then it can produce gold from the earth .

We reached ero in four hours taking a jeep from the upper city of Assam , North Lakshmipur .
The headquarters of Lower Subbasiri district at this place .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the visitors .
This is that charming place where companions live .
It took us a long time to reach here before making a road to the jeep .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful Premrose , Violet , wild currents , strawberry and rosary enjoy the tourists coming here .
Apple and potato are abundant here .

This beautiful valley is the residence of local people .

Rice is cultivated here .
This place is called the reservoir of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is the living example of their labour and farming .
Their necessity of irrigation gets mixed with Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight also falls on the left side in the midst of snowy mountain ranges .
The air is very cold .
In the weather one also feels cold and humidity in Kanken .
Beneath the trees on hearing the chirping of whispers one gets to see the sand lying on the floor of the wood .
Nothing is seen more in weather due to dullness before sunrise and mist in sunset .
The eye gets stuck on the eastern slope .
One feels like sitting on a bench kept in the verandah .
On applying the hand light sounds of the bright layer of the saliva begin to shine and the hand gets removed with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country this is the first experience in the life of Switzerland to spend the night in this small village amidst snowy mountains .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this more time has been spent in Geneva or around it .
The dense population settled on both the sides of the Saru river in the valleys is spread till far on the slopy slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , on both the sides of which are situated many small and big cities .
Along with the Ron river the carriage on the highway and the road is clearly visible .
At a distance of 300 kms and a journey of one and a half hours by vehicle the Ron river coming from the east side parallel to Jeneva lake and half an hour enjoys the Geneva lake which is called French Lake Lema .
Geneva city is situated at the western end of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
The lakes here again proceed towards the west by crossing the river .
Dhawal , Gaganchumbi , Alps mountain ranges in front of Dyani and Lake .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke on the left side by exit we reached the mountainous roads of the northern side leaving the highway .
Due to the slopes of the mountains being southern the sun at noon provides abundant sunshine all over the place .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow here is not less than the normal .
The higher the density of snow increases as it goes .
Despite good snowfall on both the sides of the road the clear sky and bright sunlight does not cool much in the air .
We reached a small village named Thale after completing a journey of approximately 20 k . . on this toured hilly road in half an hour .
Shale - This is a very large multi-purpose building made up of wood with slopy roof .
In the basement made of this three storied cement concrete along with the arrangement of keeping cars in the basement there is also room for controlling essential services like cartilage , water , landlord .
Switzerland is famous for grapes .
This is the main center of making wine - grapes intoxication .
Grapes are cultivated in 37 percent land area of the whole cantonment .
On both the sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of grapes in the village provide a unique view of the beauty there .
Taking in the gardens of grapes , strolling , resting in the night in the village there and making the grapes of grapes wine wrap is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named earlier there is a big museum of grapes built in a palanquin made in 12th century to see which foreign tourists keep making preference booking .
Once again we are going through the deserted forest of Daman .
The mind was getting worse by the question of children three to four kms of road way .
Then only a turn comes the dramatic and charming change of the scene .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road many houses are there .
People are skiing on the slopes above the village .
The dense forest of cedar trees is spread till the head of the mountain on the skiing slope .
There are dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colonies are shining with the sun rays .
We reached the village in five minutes .
This silence is spread here as well .
White snow empire ranging from peaks of mountains to valleys on all four sides .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round chakra in the middle of that time .
Sometimes the name of the place is Laukarvad .
The population of Leukarabad settled at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
1700 apartments and shelters with a capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for accommodation of 1500 , camping site for tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants here we can guess the number of tourists , sportspersons and patients coming here .
Till now a total of 65 heat waves have been found in Leukarabad .
From this 40 lac litres -LRB- 250 feet -RRB- of hot water can be reached in the small and big 30 thermal pools made in the entire atmosphere , some pools are there in five star hotels and pocket followers of different income groups .
On reaching the village a hot feeling is felt .
The thick level of snow is shining on the roofs of the house in the bright sunshine .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albanian village is one of the preserved places of Switzerland in the form of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxi and therefore there is no checking .
The journey is on , the state is on the other , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are also one , the wind is also one .
The moisture in the whole body is also one .
During rainy season the shine of the weather is also one .
As soon as the project of Darjeeling safari is completed the decision of taking a circus joke was taken first .
Carsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens are filled with dry deciduous forests .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
Moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the tea gardens welcome you in a humorous way .
The heart gets enchanted just as one goes through the road in the middle of the tea gardens .
On one side green mountains full of jungles and deep green fields on the other side .
Sometimes the jungles here and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once upon a time it was difficult to see these natural jungles and plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens .
Creation takes a strange look on the roads .
Like snake charmers , tails and moulded roads were moving .
Time was also passing .
Whatever was not cut , that is forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance many mountainous houses - houses etc . were visible .
This was Carciang .
Standing at one place here we make the program of roaming the whole day .
So took a car and came out to roam around in Carsiang .
First of all a deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by thick forests on all four sides .
To reach till the Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsong the tourists have not yet been able to develop or become famous in the form of tourist spots .
However the situation is quite clear .
Despite the desolate roads reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles the joy of climbing the road between the greed and smoke trees was giving us the thrill .
Next place was Eagle Craig .
On the other side of this city at a height is a point .
This is called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a dome here on the top of which a beautiful view of the whole city is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women become efficient in bringing a token on the back with their hands very fast .
There is a museum outside the Carsiang city , but that day we could not go there , because the circular weather in the tea gardens seemed to be more necessary .
Next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but it seemed as if it was raining then how would it be
But the connection was very good that reaching till Rock Garden we were able to enjoy sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant than this .
If you go a little below from here then you will find Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the view of waterfalls is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that if waterfalls are scattered in the empire of rocks then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is found in rocks .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw the air loop in Darjeeling climbing upwards through the vehicle .
From here the whole of the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen through binoculars .
The mood of the weather was still good .
But the one we proceeded towards Monastery , who knows from where the clouds started collecting and shining .
Walking and shopping in Malroad in the evening is planned .
In the journey of Darjeeling the tour of Toy Train makes it even more attractive .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Sleep and Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake and a bit of breakfast in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on the same route , where sweaters etc . made by Nepali artisans are found .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here rather there is a sound of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Love and Lolehgaon , which are full of jungle waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for roaming in the winters in Darjeeling but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me automatically .
A journey of my recent past was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan , was very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an adventurous subject in which sometimes the journey attracts us and sometimes another special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like pink city or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to a special attraction .
The place where I am going to talk about it has been prepared four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has been made in reality that is worth enjoying in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears even today my guide Ram Babu was thinking of minarets . could not even imagine that I could stay in this way in my jungle .
Fifty percent staff are in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in heritage hotels .
The residents of Ajmer used to work in Jaipur before Ram Babu and now this is a royal palace .
He has rebuilt his lifestyle in a different style .
The estimation of Sahib Aman Bugyal .
There no one will ever address you in English .
Such gardens are really a place of peace and happiness .
This garden also has a history of its own and the biggest thing is to introduce it to the nearby areas .
The royal holidays of Rajasthan , how many Ghosts have traveled in Bhangarh . There is no need to go away . few among the residents of Jaipur perhaps have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of such gate many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana had invited me there but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh forgetting the road .
This time I reached there suddenly to invite my foreign guests . felt as if those who want to spend a good holiday in less time should go to such a bag .
This garden is one of the seven gardens in which the king of Alwar had taken rest to hunt .
This was constructed in nineteenth or twentieth .
Its old walls are the witnesses of those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bugyal surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees will hypnotise you .
The way you will be welcomed in the entrance that you will feel that here the attention of divine peace is paid .
Manglachar ' s mantra is said to be simple with the hand binding with mule .
We reached in the evening and decided that we will set out to cover the garden .
My table sister Jackie said with a joke . It is very interesting .
Inspired by all havelis and palaces .
The beauty here is enchanting .
Everything new and artistic . It is not surprising that such a garden has been rewarded recently .
The manager fixed our program for the morning .
First of all Ram went walking on foot with Babu and then toured Bhangarh jeep .
Walking on the way to Katra we saw the fort of Arambgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw Sukhi lake in which peasants are growing .
This year it did n't rain but for the first time it was observed to be the cultivation of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life for Jackie was very pleasant .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars.
While leaving such bugyals they say goodbye to us by eating jaggery and curd in traditional ways .
Now I realized why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that for seeing the lifestyle of tribals also tour packages are prepared .
That's right.
Definitely this is done in not only one state but also in many states and tourists get special pleasure in this tour .
These tours are generally made for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included among these .
This way an attempt has been made to travel such a place where there was not much development and there was no significant impact on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this old tourist sites etc are also there .
Apart from this concentration on food habits is also taken care of .
Actually the aim of such tours is to bring the tourists face to face with the habit of living and tradition at all these places .
Though it feels a bit difficult to imagine but such tours are really thrilling and a different experience .
There is a different kind of fun to travel by bus .
Despite being with many of them you can take the pleasure of staying alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can read your favorite books for a long time without interruption .
Yes , this is exactly that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace this journey demands you all .
For enjoying this trip it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are touring a foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , elderly people of military , children etc . get rid of this trip and there is arrangement of leaves for both of them .
However , tickets are a little cheaper beforehand hence better than plans for bus journey in the end .
Instead of taking tickets on both the sides take information about round trips .
It is cheap .
Goods related rules are done specially hence enquire about the weight of the luggage .
It does not happen that you have to leave your luggage on the terminal or you have to pay more rent .
Also ascertain the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags is appropriate for this journey .
Because it gets stuck on the top of the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods is yours .
From where you board the bus you reach there an hour before the scheduled time .
Keep this in mind specially during busy season .
Actually , the sooner you reach the better place to sit .
Remember the comfort while choosing a place to sit .
There is more stiffness in the back and one is unable to fall straight towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then in what direction do you take place , and if you do not like to get very tired then it would be better to take a seat towards the window .
This time it's a clever thing.
If you are both trying to cleave then first sit in the seat of the angle and keep your bag on the nearby seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then while choosing the place to sit keep this in mind because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Talk to the bus driver or conductor .
By this you will be able to know many important information .
While cleaning the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this you will not leave your luggage in the place of your own luggage because if you lose it then the residents will not take charge of it .
Wherever the bus stops come back in time .
If you do not get time you can take a new passenger at your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe then you did not see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is famous for glorious cities of ancient Europe and many other things .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is one of the oldest cities in the world from where civilization emerges .
This is the reason that its imprint on the Western civilization is worth seeing .
Rome , located near the Taiwa river , is a pilgrimage for the Roman Roman Roman Roman religious followers because the residence of the main Pope of this religion is in Rome .
Ancient Rome is located on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , Saravial Wall was built around it .
The ruins of this can still be seen around Rome .
For ancient buildings and many ruins Rome is famous in the whole world .
This city with royal palace , beautiful church , beautiful fountains , domes and magnificent palaces hypnotise it in the first glimpse .
The construction of this large and incomparable building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy , Divine Victor Emanuel began in 1885 and ended in 1911 .
In front of it there is a idol sitting on the horse of Emperor Imanuel which takes 20 years to build .
Here unmarried soldiers sacrificed in the First World War are given burials .
The carvings of this memorial and the victory marks built on it are worth visit .
This is also a museum .
If you are interested in art works then you must see them .
Along with the memorial not only Rome but the famous and magnificent turn of Italy is ' Piazza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this verandah is famous as the Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this Piata de Spagnao ' is also very popular among tourists and people come to visit each other in the evening .
After enjoying Piazza Venezia you must go to Rome 's famous road i . . Via Dale Course .
Big shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the beauty of this road .
This road is the main road of Rome .
This unique building is built on the Capitoline Hill and is located at a very height .
Famous for climbing this , Michael Angelo of the stairs was built in 1536 .
Sitting on a horse in front of Capitoline is the idol of Emperor Marcus Arrelius who ruled Rome from 160 - 180 AD .
This beautiful idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capitoline is also a different identity of this building .
There is a church , museum and ancient temple in Capitoline Complex .
The symbol of Rome is Colosseum .
This huge summit was constructed in 80 AD and 50 , 000 audience can sit here simultaneously .
In colossal gladiators i . . swordsmen show their duties .
This would not have happened in itself , it would have been fighting with wild animals .
Whether it is with the other swordsman or with the animals , this fight keeps on going on till the time one dies .
There were many forums in ancient Rome .
We did n't say that the place to visit was called Forum .
All social , religious , economic , political etcetera of the city take place here .
Among these the most famous forums were Roman and the remains of Raj Bhavan , temples and pillars are present even today .
Seeing this the importance of ancient Rome can be estimated very well .
Panthiyan - This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 AD .
In the middle of its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
For this place devotees feel that their prayers are reaching straight to the God .
Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are made all around .
Although in 6100 AD this temple was converted into a church .
There are many gardens in Rome but Villa Borgis is incomparable .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to Rome .
You must go to the museum here as well because if you do not see this then you will lose the chance to see beautiful carvings .
The idols made here are unique and so lively that they feel like speaking at once .
Here first Napoleon ' s sister Polin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis royal family , the idol sleeping in her palanquin seems so lively that you can not see for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is the fountains here .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which beautiful fountains are built .
The most famous fountains here are trivial fountains .
It is believed that if someone goes to Rome again then he should pay a penny in this fountain with a desire .
By doing this the heart gets full .
The journey of this ancient city is not complete until you see Vatican City .
This place in the sixth century is the residence of the highest religious head Pope of the Roman Catholic religious followers .
Although it is in Rome but in 1926 the status of an independent city was given .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter 's Square , Fountains , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Actually this will show you a different world and you will always feel like remembering .

If you suddenly stand in front of yourself on a plane strolling around the big airport then you will feel that it is a toy .
But this twin Ooty plane with 12 - 15 sitting places is excellent in the form of a tour of an island group like Maldives .
You do n't get to know when suddenly you get up in the air to run like a speed boat on the water .
Throughout the flight you start feeling like climbing on the normal flight .
You will always remain under your sight - you will see resort islands and coral islands in different kinds of blue waters of Maldives .
How clear is everything looked .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these which has 20 c planes .
If you want you can travel by air for about four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- an hour or the whole sea plane can hire it for a day -LRB- although the pressure of tax -RRB- .
If you go to another island from Malley island then it will be necessary for you to travel a sea plane because that is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you never want that end .
The journey from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilavaru -RRB- of Sea plane is done on the island of Maldives .
We were at the biggest antique and sweet shops of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Mall .
The speeches given by the President of Maldives Mr . Ambassador of Maldives to the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier were heard very carefully .
In a way I could not see the speech of the president or the prime minister in any Hindustani so much as possible .
But when there is a question of a new existence being created on this earth then it is necessary to have such seriousness .
Many people would go to Maldives even after seeing the bathrooms made in the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October and would feel that if the wrath of nature snatches it from us then how much poverty will be on earth .
There is a different kind of thing in the beauty there .
In this small country so much beauty is not felt .
While going towards the jetty to return to the cruise again from that journey of the market when we turned back on our way to the sea water then we realized how much people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water is so clear that in the light of the lamppost colorful fish is seen in a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
You will have the privilege of seeing some differences in the water of the sea or river connected with any city of India .
On coming to the top of Ambie Aquarine it took two hours in the evening spent in the mall .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find refreshment in the crampons .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest personality house of any country , no security personnel could be seen till far .
In fun we were taking photographs of the garden just fifty metres away by spreading our hands in the entrance of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader 's house in India like this
It was also known that the President sometimes went to his office two blocks before crossing the road on foot .
Everything in the matter of Maldives makes us feel astonished .
That is why we were waiting for Brussels the next day .
It seemed that this day would be special .
In the morning taking a boat from the cruise we went to the airport island .
From there crossing the cycle of the runway we reached the base of Trans Maldives .
The next day in the evening when the cruise was reaching near the mall , then we immediately recognised the aeroplane passing above .
I had seen many pictures .
But then did I know that next day we will get a chance to ride on this plane .
We were going to Rangoli island five kilometres away from Trans , Maldives and Sea plane .
It was unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives while flying at a height of approximately thousands of metres .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
In excitement and excitement breathing was stopped .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on the Rangoli Island it felt as if we have come to another world .
In such a world which has no relation with outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and luxury found here was difficult to get out .
Tour of Korade can also be done on foot or in battery driven cars .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going till the main island from Jetty was unique .
Until now we have not been able to get along with the natural beauty of the surroundings , we have reached such a place which was unimaginable .
Descending down several metres above the stairs in the sea we reached such a room of glass which was under water .
This house was actually a meal house .
On all sides small and big fishes of rocks , corral , snorkelling and scuba diving people were watching .
The imagination of eating and drinking on a decorated floor over there is very thrilling .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch on this island from Male to Airlines is 47 thousand rupees per person .
He did n't feel like returning from there .
We were ready to float in our passport water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With the feeling of sadness I returned with this hope that sometimes luck will come here .
I was planning to get out of Delhi for a long time but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
There was a lot of interest in wildlife in childhood , so I thought lets go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking till Penang Lake before Khardungla Pass in Ladakh .
We left for Jim Corbett from Delhi on 27 December but the fervor that we had taken out , the fog had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajraula was very tiring .
Again on it is the path of despair and bad weather .
Many a times it felt that it would have fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Tikuli near the park itself , which we had booked beforehand .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we went for a stroll on the edge of Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for Corbett museum which was near Ghangadi gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening to return .
I had come out firmly from Delhi that I would definitely see tigers roaming in the jungle but I had seen tigers throughout the night .
In the depths of the night suddenly I could hear the sound of a loud voice and then the dog which began to chew , began to walk for two hours .
Initially Kaladungi and Corbett came to the advice of visiting the fruits .
Kaladungi is located at a distance of thirty kilometres on the Corbett Falls road .
There is an exhibition of the Mr . Jim Corbett in Kaladungi where some special things related to his life are kept .
It was half past twelve to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village only .
After reaching the resort the jeepsy of the safari was waiting for us .
It is said that they have made arrangements for sighting in the number one site Bijrani .
It is said about number one that the grass there is more and the tigers come to save themselves from the cold at this time .
On reaching Bijrani we are given a guide that we will take two and a half rupees for a four hour tour .
We went out for the jungle inside .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two teeth elephants which had long teeth .
I got a photograph on the ground .
In the midst of this the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park , many of them died in these days only .
At many places we got to see the footprints of the lions , but the heart was restless due to the lack of sights of the tiger .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
There was a lion 's ghost in my head .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I just called him.
I told him I had come to Corbett.
He asked if I had seen a tiger .
His words were tied like a shore .
I said slowly that I did not see .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
One of us told us to take a safari for roaming inside .
