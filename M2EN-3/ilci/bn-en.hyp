Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yeah, it's different.
On one side of Kutch is Sindhu and on the other side Gujarat is also a mixture of both in language .
This language is called Kutchi .
Although there is no writing in this language .
If you want to write Kutch then it will have to be written in Gujarati script .
Near only to Bhuj is that Anjar city where several times earthquake took place and the whole city got destroyed .
Near Anjar only is the tomb of Jaisalmer - Toral .
The stories of Jasal Toral are very adventurous .
If we want to return by that route through whichever road we have to take another month 's vacation and on the other side schools will open in Bombay .
Then what can one do  Now we will take a journey of the train by pulling the buses of Gujarat fast .
A small train of metre gauge reaches Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there a metre gauge train will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad big trains of broad gauge will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry considered as the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through very bad situations these days .
Due to the fear of recession and increased terror in South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has come very less .
According to the recent numbers published by the Rajasthan government in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan decreased by ten percent in comparison to 2009 .
According to the number of national tourists 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists less than 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 . 98 lakh 36 , 564 tourists came to Rajasthan from which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were there in comparison to foreign tourists in 2009 total 2 . 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 . . 58 , 691 were national and 73 , 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism are very anxious due to this situation .
The director of Rajput Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to business recession and fear incidents tourism business has been affected badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop and develop strong baseline structures in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism this year has been very good .
This is the first time in 2000 that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
For desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forest tourists everything has been kept in old conditions .
For working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , thrilling tourism in the area of tourism all governments are increasing but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
The incidents of rape and irritation happening with foreign tourists in Rajasthan in the last few years have also made this state 's pictures internationally bad .
The Rajasthan government had given the preservation of tourism industry many years ago in the state but it was confined to papers only .
One example of a success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the purpose of enhancing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the baseline of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1997 .
This corporation provides facilities like residence , food , travel , boating etc to the tourists .
A total of 75 units are there in this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 battalions , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one train , one and two trains , palace on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the situation of this corporation has worsened for a few years .
In 2008 - 09 RTDC had a loss of 185 lacs which is estimated to be 632 lacs in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel situation of this corporation is such that in the last five years 40 percent houses of this hotel have not been filled .
Along with hotels other groups of corporations have also faced greater losses than this .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction for every tourist of this railway .
Even after reducing fare this could not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair has been lessened .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 AD in the Tourist Village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year the number of tourists decreased to 217 .
Among these the satisfaction of RTDC is that of palace on wheels i . . royal train has shown some deficit in the attraction of tourists .
There is unparalleled benefit from this railway .
Last year RTDC got a profit of nine and a half crore rupees from this rail .
It is natural for Rajasthan to be disturbed due to these losses in tourism .
Tourism is the biggest festival of Rajasthan economy .
If a person has the desire to do something then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has proved it by building modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahadri Mountain ranges of Maharashtra .
The dreams which he dreamt were a little successful everyday and he was happy to see them .
His happiness was seen at the time of the inauguration of his own airport Ambo Valley .
The work of Ambo Valley started and today Amby Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a beautiful city .
This city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres has been made available hotels , houses and other facilities on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Many entrepreneurs have come forward to build their houses in this city made for millions of people and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially entrepreneurs and elders bought their houses in the form of holiday homes but now they have made it their home and are coming to Mumbai for work from here itself .
Behind Ambel Valley is Koirigadh fort which provides the beauty of this area .
In the west Siang district the ruins of Likabali are of utmost importance .
Remains of a large temple were found after excavation .
Statues of padmas and goddesses carved on the rocks of this temple have been found which are found mostly in Bhagswamy .
Malini Than is an important place of this region .
Dussehra of Devi Durga has been found at this place .
Behind the names of these idols and places many sweet stories and ancient legends are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalapani even today reflect the glorious story of Arunachal even today .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythical stories the description of the greatness of the Goddess Tamraswari is found .
During the time of Chaitra kings this goddess was valid upto afar off on the North - East hills .
People worship the goddess here .
Here Narbali used to be there which later King Gaurinath Singh shut down .
In the Lohira district of Arunachal some other ruins have been found .
This is called the ruins of Bhishma Nagar .
According to the popular story here this place is also ancient Vidarbha , where once King Bhishma had ruled .
Brahmakund is located below Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tribals like Digaru , Mishami etc . visit the travellers here .
These people have their own devotion towards this Kunda .
Near the Brahmakund is the famous Parshuram Kund .
During Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins decorated in the form of pilgrimages the ruins of Roranga of Dibang - Bailey district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of a brick pond near Roranga tell their story even today .
The ruins of bathing in the valleys , ripe stairs and another pond surrounded by concrete paths on all four sides and widening wide roads even today reflect their ancient grandeur .
We reached ero in four hours by jeep from the upper city of Assam , North Laxmipur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of about 4500 feet this charming mountainous place captivates the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where ancestors live .
Before making the way to the jeep it used to take several days to reach here .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premrose , violets , wild currents , strawberries and rabbits enjoy the pleasures of the tourists coming here .
Apple and potato are very good here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of Patan .
By doing their tired labor wealthy fellows have made this place a heaven .
Rice farming is done here .
This place is called the store of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and cultivation .
The need for irrigation is fulfilled from Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
Eyes fall towards the light redness rising in the sky in the middle of the snowclad mountain range towards the left .
The wind is very cold .
In the weather Konkan also feels moisture along with cold .
Under the trees after listening to the sounds of murmur we get gazed at the sails lying on the floor of the wood .
Nothing can be seen in the weather due to sluggishness and fog before sunrise .
Eyes get stuck on the redness of the east .
He wants to sit on the bench kept in the verandah .
On applying the hand the glare of the teeth becomes shining and the hand moves as soon as it feels cold in the hands .
This is the first experience in the life of spending a night in this small village in the midst of these mountains covered with snow thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third migration to Swiss .
Before this more time has been spent in Geneva or near it .
Located in the valleys of both the sides of the Saru river the dense population is spread up to a great extent on the slight slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Ron , on both the sides of which is a small and big city .
Along with the Ron river the vehicles on the highway and the roads are clearly visible .
A distance of 300 k . . and a journey of one and a half hours , half way , parallel to Geneva lake and along half Ron river the Ron river coming in eastern direction meets the Geneva lake which is called the French lake .
100 km long and 10 km wide is situated in the western part of this lake Geneva city .
The lakes here again move towards the west through the river .
Responsible and lake beside Dhawal , skyscraping mountain ranges of Alps .
After crossing a beautiful small town named Luke leaving the highway on the left side we reached the hilly path of the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun sets in the afternoon in full swing .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow here is less than required .
The more the height goes the more the density of the snow increases .
Despite good snow being frozen on both the sides of the road the clear sky and shining sun does not get special cold in the air .
After covering a distance of about 20 kms on this turning hilly road in half an hour we reached a small village named Thal .
Shelley . It is a slopy bungalow made of wood with full sleeve .
In this three storied bungalow built with cement concrete along with the arrangement of staying in the basement there is also a room for regulation of essential services like current , water , laundry .
Switzerland is famous for grape farming .
This is the main center of wine - grapes making alcohol .
Grapes are grown on 37 percent of the total area of the cantonment .
The gardens of grapes in the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley give a unique view of the beauty there .
Taking in the gardens of grapes , roaming , resting at night in the villages there and going to the factories for the manufacture of grapes , drinking water is an integral part of tourism here .
There is a big museum of grapes in a Pallivavan built in 12th century in a small colony named before which foreign tourists keep on booking for sightseeing .
Once again we were passing through the deserted jungle in the courtyard .
The road till 3 . kms was getting worse on the question of children .
Then only a dramatic and charming change comes in view .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley towards the left of the road many houses are there .
People are skiing on the slope above the village .
On the skiing slope the dense forest of cedar is spread till the head of the mountain .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlements shining like the rays of the sun .
We reached the village in five minutes .
The same silence is spread here as well .
From the peaks of the mountains all around to the valleys is the empire of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round in the middle of that basket .
The name of Kasbar is Luckerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Lucarabad is approximately 1500 .
Here we can estimate the number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming to this place from the 6900 bed capacity apartments and shops , 28 hotels for the stay of 1500 people , camping sites for tents , 90 bed health centers and 50 restaurants .
Till now a total of 65 yards of hot water has been found in Lukorabad .
Around 40 lac litres -LRB- everyday -RRB- of hot water -LRB- 51 centegrade -RRB- of small and big pools made at places can be reached , some pools are of five star hotels and pockets of other income groups .
One feels a hot feeling after reaching the village .
In the shining sun the thick surface of the snow is shining on the roofs of the house .
The name of this village is Albinin .
Albinin village is one of the reserved places in Switzerland in the form of a rickshaw .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxi , so there is no checking .
The journey is on , the region is different , but the hills are same , the trees are also same , the air is also one .
The moisture in the whole body is also one .
Brightness is also the same in the season of rains .
As soon as the plan of Darjeeling is clear it is decided to take a ride of carsings first .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens filled with thick forests .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
Moving from Siliguri towards Darjeeling first tea garden welcomes you in laughter .
In the middle of the tea garden the heart beats up for the first time through the road .
On one side is a green mountain full of jungles and on the other a deep green trench .
Sometimes jungles here and sometimes tea gardens are seen here .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once we had fallen in difficulty - we will not see these natural jungles , this tree planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle was the more beautiful the tea gardens of the country .
Looking at the streets it feels strange .
Travellers and travellers like snakes were passing through the way .
Time was also flowing .
The one which was not cut is the garden of forests and tea .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance a hilly house - house etc . were seen to be very dense .
It was Karsiyang .
Standing at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we set out to roam around in Kaisang .
First of all Deer Parks .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach Chadaipur i . . deer park we had to leave the vehicle quite below .
Despite being brimming with the beauty of Karsiyang the form of a tourist spot has not yet been developed and famous .
Although diarrhoea is quite clean .
Despite the destruction of the road reaching till the deer park surrounded by the jungle we were giving the pleasure of climbing the road amidst the greed and thick trees .
Next place was Eagle Craig .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
This is called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers committed suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a dome here from where one gets to see a beautiful view while observing the entire city .
In the nearby tea gardens women are efficient in pressing tea with a blanket on their backs at a very fast speed .
There is a museum outside the city of Kaisang but that day we could not go there because the open weather of tea gardens seemed very important .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but there was a lot of worry as to how would we wander if there was such rains .
But the connection was very good that by reaching till Rock Garden we could take the benefit of sunrise .
This garden is a beautiful place adorned with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On going a little below from here the Gangamaya surrounded by mountains is found .
Here the magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls of the rocky empire are adorned here and the fountains of waterfalls in the Ganges are adorned with the magnificent rocks .
Both these places are located quite below the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw the air loop in Darjeeling rising upwards with the help of a car .
From here the whole of the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The temper of the weather has remained good till now .
But the one who moved towards monastery knows from where the clouds started gathering and shining .
There is a plan of walking and shopping in the mule road in the evening .
Toy Train in the journey of Darjeeling makes the journey even more attractive .
The journey of toy train from Darjeeling to sleep and sleeping till Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik Lake here and a little rest in the garden .
On the same way tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where sweaters made by the Nepalese artisans are found .
Arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , rather there is a sound of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolehgaon , which are filled with jungle - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the winters but tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me by themselves .
A recent journey of myself was very thrilling and entertaining .
This journey was neither of foreign countries nor of Rajasthan very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an exciting thing in which at times the journey attracts us and at times some special place , ships of water or some royal train or lake palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where I am going to tell is prepared about four and a half years ago , but the preparation that was made with this place is really like decorating the jungle .
Not only for those who stay there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears even today speaking of my guide Ram Babu Mina ' Saheb , we could not even imagine this way in my jungles .
Fifty percent stuff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get jobs in heritage hotels as well .
The inhabitants of Ajanta Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before this and now this is the royal atmosphere .
He renovated himself in a different way in his walking .
Saheb is the guess of such a bugyal .
There no one addresses you in English .
Such a bugyal is really a peaceful and peaceful place .
This garden has a history of its own and the biggest thing is that it also introduces to its nearby areas .
How many of them have been touring the ruins of ghosts during the royal holidays of Rajasthan . There is no need to go away . very few people have also spent the night in this area among Jaipur residents .
After the opening of such a garden many big personalities of the country and abroad came here .
I remember that night when Shabana Ajmi had invited me there but I could not go .
It is a matter of fact that he had himself gone by mistake to Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , it seemed as if those who want to spend a good holiday in less time they should go there .
This bug is one of those seven bugs where the king of Albert took rest to hunt .
This was built in nineteen or twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of such a bugyal will hypnotise you .
The way you enter inside the way you will be welcomed you will feel that attention is paid to the divine peace here .
Manglachar ' s mantra is uttered vivaciously by tying mule in hand .
We reached in the afternoon and decided to take a dip in the bugyal .
My table sister Jackie said , It is very charming .
Inspired by all the havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is the light house here .
Everything is new and dangerous , it is not surprising that such a garden has been given prizes recently .
The manager arranged our program for morning .
First of all on walking with Ram Babu we went and then roamed Bhangad jeep .
While walking on the path of crookedness we saw the fort of Ajmer on which the light of the sun was gradually flowing .
We saw Sukhi lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but first time we saw tobacco cultivation happening .
The opportunity to see rural life for Jackie was very enjoyable .
After this we went to Bhangarh via a jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist from Holland sitting stuck to him in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars.
They bid farewell after eating jaggery and curd in traditional style while leaving such a bag .
Now we got to know why tourists used to spend so much money here .
I have heard that a tour package is made to see the lifestyle of the tribals .
Is that right
Certainly this is not so much that the tourists in many states also show special gaiety to this tour .
This tour is ordinarily made for four days to two weeks time and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying , eating etc are also included .
This way attempts are made to tour such places where there has not been much improvement and there has not been a special effect of nature and human lifestyle on them .
Along with this there are also old tourist sites etc .
Besides this concentration is also given on consumption of traditional food .
Actually the purpose of such tour is to make the tourists confronted with the customs and traditions of lodging at these places .
Although it seems a little difficult to think but such tours are really thrilling and unique .
Travelling by bus is a different joy .
You can enjoy staying alone despite being with many of them .
Not only this , in this journey you can also read your favorite books for a long time without interruption .
Yes , it is true that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace this trip also demands from all of you .
For enjoying this tour certain things should be kept in mind especially when you are touring some foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior citizens , kids etc . get a chance to travel in this journey and there is also facility of accommodation for both .
Although buying tickets from before is a bit cheaper hence at the end doing bus travel is better than before planning .
Instead of taking both the tickets take information about round trips .
It is cheap .
Goods related regulations are specially done so ask about the loads and weight of goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your luggage in the terminal or you have to pay an extra rent .
Along with this know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags is appropriate for this journey .
Because it gets stuck on the surface of the seat .
Keep in mind this thing that while changing the bus the luggage of the luggage is yours .
From where you will board the bus you will reach there an hour before the scheduled time .
In the busy season you should keep in mind this thing specially .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better you will find place to sit .
While picking up place to sit keep in mind the rest .
There is a lot of jerk in the back side and one does not get to read properly in the front .
If you are going to the bathroom again and again then take a place at the corner , if you do not like to be excessively disturbed then it would be better to take a seat towards the window .
This time it's a trick.
If you are both trying to swim then first sitting in the seat of the corner keep your bag near the seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while choosing the place to sit because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Talk to a bus driver or conductor .
With this you will get to know many important information .
Everybody is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time you will not leave your stuff in place because if you lose it then the residents do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back in the right time .
If you do not have time then you can take a new passenger to your place and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

If a plane stands before you all of a sudden while roaming around in the big airport then you will feel it to be a toy .
But this twin anterplane with 12 - 15 seats is indescribable for roaming in the group of islands like Maldives .
One does not even know when suddenly one gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the water .
In the entire flight you get to feel the flight of ordinary flights .
Always keep your eyes underneath - to see the different kinds of blue waters of Maldives , resort islands and coral islands .
How clear everything is visible .
There are two plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them which has twenty C planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or you can rent the entire sea plane for a day -LRB- although it should be for that -RRB- .
If you go to any other island from Male island then you will need to travel by plane because that is the only way of traveling between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want to finish .
Sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Utma Mavilavaru -RRB- in the island of Maldives .
We were in the shops of the capital 's biggest antique and suvenire market in Mall .
The speeches delivered by the president of all the Salesman Maldives at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier were being heard carefully .
Saying like this I have not been able to hear the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister of any Indian with so much interest .
But when the question of a new existence arises on this soil then it is necessary to be so serious .
Several people would also like to go to Maldives after meeting in the bottom of the water through the cabinet of Maldives if the wrath of nature snatched it from us then how poor the world would be .
There is a special thing in its beauty .
In this small country one does not feel so beautiful .
While going towards Jetty again from that trip of the market to go back to the cruise , when the eyesight turned towards the waters of the sea passing through the way then we realized how much people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water is so clear that in the light of the lamppost colorful fish is seen a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
You will be able to see some miracles clearly in the waters of sea or rivers attached to any city of India .
In order to come to the amby aquamine the spending of the male is spent two hours in the evening .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get coral on Crumber .
Just a while before listening to the speeches of President Nashi we were standing outside his government residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest personality house of any country , till far no security personnel were seen .
We were enjoying taking photographs of the garden just fifty metres away by opening our hands inside the door of his bungalow .
Can you think of the house of any leader in India in such a way
It also came to be known that the president had gone to his office two blocks ahead crossing the road on foot .
Everything in the matter of Maldives impresses us .
This is why we were waiting for the next day for Brussels .
It seemed as if this day would be special .
In the morning taking a boat from the cruise we took to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives after crossing the runway .
The next day in the afternoon when the cruise reached near the mall then we recognized the airplanes flying above us promptly .
I had seen a lot of pictures .
But then what did I know that the next day there would be an opportunity to board this plane .
We were going to Rangoli island at a distance of five kilometres by plane of Trans Maldives .
Flying on this plane above a height of approximately thousands of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives are unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
With thrill and excitement airplane was to stop breathing .
But on reaching the conrad resort of the Hillton Hotel on Rangoli Island it feels as if we have come to some other world .
In such a world which has no relation with external world .
There was no such relation that it was difficult to get the beauty and luxury found here .
The journey of Konark can be done walking on foot or in a battery operated car .
The scene of water life on both the sides of the bridge goes from Jetty to the main island .
Till now we were unable to adapt to the surrounding nature , reached such a place which was unimaginable .
After climbing down many metres down through the stairs in the sea we reached a room in which was at the bottom of the water .
This house was actually a mess room .
Above all the glass small and big fish of Bilkin Rock , coral , snorkelling and scuba diving people were seen .
The imagination of eating sitting on the floor decorated there gives a lot of thrill .
The fare of lunch underwater on this island by plane from Male is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I did not want to return from there .
We were ready to drive our passport in water .
But I knew that it was not possible .
With a sad heart I returned with the hope that sometimes , sometimes luck will certainly bring here .
I had been planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but it was not possible because of the busyness of the work .
There was a lot of interest in wildlife in childhood therefore we thought that this time we should go to Jim Corbett .
After biking till Peng Lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 this was the second bike tour .
On 27 December we set out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but with the courage that we had come out the fog had reduced our speed .
The road between Hamud and Gajrola was very tiring .
Again fog and bad roads are above them .
Many a times it seemed as if it would fall .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres prior to Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Tikuli just near the Park whose booking we had done beforehand .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we set out to roam around Kosi earlier .
After staying there for two - three hours we went out for the Corbett museum which was at a distance of two kilometres from Ghangadi gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening to return .
It was getting stronger from Delhi that I would definitely see a tiger roaming in the jungle but I saw a tiger all night in a dream .
Suddenly I heard loud voices in the depths of the night and then the dogs who started shouting started walking for two hours .
Initially the advice of visiting Kaladungi and Corbett fruits came .
Kaladungi is located at a distance of thirty kilometres , falls only on the Corbett Falls road .
In Kaladungi there is a circumambulation hall of Jim Corbett Sahib where special things related to his life are kept .
It was half past two and a half times to return back .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village only .
After reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they had arranged for sighting in Sight Vijrani number one .
It is said about number one that more grass is there and more lions come in this direction only to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani a guide is given to us that it takes two and a half rupees to roam around four hours .
We had set out for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two teeth of elephants , whose long teeth were tall .
I collected photographs .
In the midst of this the guide began to track the tiger .
The guide said that there are approximately 150 lions in the park , many of which have died in a few days .
At many places we had seen the footprints of the tigers but on not seeing the tiger we felt bad .
We were returning to Delhi on the third day .
The ghost of a lion was just on my head .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I just called him .
I told him that Corbett had come .
He asked if we had seen the tiger .
His saying was like that of a shore .
I gradually said that I had not seen it .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
One of us told us to take a safari to roam inside .
