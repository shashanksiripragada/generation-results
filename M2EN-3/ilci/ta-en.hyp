These days tourism industry considered to be the main source of economy of Rajasthan has become bad .
Along with the adventurous accidents happening in Vaishno Devi and South Asia the tourism industry has a bad impact .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan among the major states of the country has been estimated to be less in these days .

According to statistics 9 . percent of the number of tourists and 27 . percent less in the number of foreign tourists .

This is the first time in the year of 2002 that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan is less .
The tourism department has not done anything new .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests are all there to attract tourists .
In the tourism sector all the governments do the work of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism in the name of adventure tourism , but nothing can be done in this situation .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get a lot of facilities .
In which foreign tourists , the acts of violence and emotional attachment in Rajasthan are also engraved on this grandeur at home .
A few years back Rajasthan government had done the job department in the state but it was only the paper .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government against the tourism department .
With the point of view of enhancing tourism development in Rajasthan and developing the natural beauty of tourism the Rajasthan government had created R . . . in 1979 .
This organization has special importance for tourists like housing , food , transport , boating etc .
There are a total of 75 facilities in this system .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 mobile phones , 3 lodgings of tourists , one lodge and two train palaces on hills and Royal Rajasthan on Hills but the situation of this lodging decreased in a few years .
In 2008 - 2009 the loss of RTDC increased to 185 lakhs and next year in 2009 - 2010 632 lakhs were estimated .
The condition of hotels of this institute is that in the last five years even 40 percent rooms have not been filled in their hotels .
The other segments of hotel organizations are also getting damaged .
Among these the most important is Royal Rajasthan Al Vehicles .
No tourist like this train .
Even though the fare is less , it can not attract tourists .
This way every year the interest of tourists decreased .
In the fair held in 2007 - 2008 there were 398 foreign tourists staying in RTDC out of which this year there were 217 .
In the midst of all this there is no doubt in attracting tourists towards the enjoyable Palace on Wheels i . . beautiful train .
This train continues to be beneficial .
Last year RTDC got profit of 91 crores from this train .
Due to this fall adopted for the tourism department of Rajasthan mixture of tourism has become common .
There is a lot of tourism in Rajasthan .

Green mountains covered in forests on one side and deep trenches on the other side .
There was a time when tea estates used to come to see here .
All around there is a green empire .
Once I was confused seeing these natural jungles or these tea plants made by humans .
Both are drawing towards themselves .
As beautiful was the forest , tea gardens spread far and wide .
The view of the roads on the way is marvellous .
Snakes are becoming circular and round like snakes .
The time was getting over .
But forest and tea gardens keep on coming .

A mountainous house , palace etc . are very deep from afar .
This was Karziaganga .
Staying at a place here we make a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is , one can go out on a tour of Curzong taking a vehicle .
First of all , Tire Park .
A small garden is surrounded by forests on all the four sides .
To reach from the top the vehicle goes very low .
Although Karzyang is full of beauty even today there is no improvement in the tourist spots .
However , the city is very good and clean .
It is a charming feeling for us to walk on the path amidst the greedy trees reaching till the Tire Park while the path surrounded by forests without hustle and bustle .
The next place was Jaisalmer .

In the nearby tea estates the women used to throw tea at the basket after changing their hands at the speed of the jungle .
There is a museum outside Karzong city , but those days we should not go out because according to the weather present in the tea gardens tourism is very important .

The effect that sometimes occurs does not come at all in Kalimpong .
We had come to Darjeeling in the cool breeze , where the tea garden spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling had tied us .
I got a lot of interest and adventure from this small tour .
This journey is very near to Jaipur not only in foreign countries but also outside Rajasthan .
Tourism has its own interest in a thing that when the traveller draws towards itself then it becomes an important place , water ship or some city like rail or rose city or lake palace of Udaipur .
People are attracted because of some special attraction .
I was saying that this place was built about four and a half years ago , in reality this place has been decorated with forests .
Not only for going there but also for staying there .
In my ears the word Rambabu Meena reflects that if we were not able to imagine before this then we would stay in the jungle like this .
50 percent workers are in this area .
Suddenly the people coming here do not get jobs even in Heritage Hotel .
Rambabu Ajafghat resident Rambabu had worked in Jaipur before this and now in this magnificent and magnificent Aman Garden .
He gave a new shape while talking to himself .
Sahiba ' is an invaluable reservoir of Aman Garden .
Where no one calls himself in English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist place with all the best facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas as well .
In the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people would roam around the Bangad of Buddha for enjoying holidays , why not go far , only a few people from Jaipur will spend the night in this area .
After the opening of the Aman garden more and more people from within the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night when Sabna Asthma called me very enthusiastic but I could not go .
When they reached Bangkok after finding their own way then it was totally different .
This time suddenly when I was invited by my foreign guests then I realized that these people want to spend a good holiday in less time hence do go to Aman Garden .
This garden is a unique garden conserved in the seven gardens where Alwar Raja had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .
Its ancient wall is the testimony of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and under the shadow of dense trees the Aman Garden charms itself in the first phase .
This way you will be welcomed in the same way as you will be able to feel the peaceful environment here .
Along with tying a rope in the wrist the mantra of Mangasar is pronounced very fast .
We arrived at the dawn in the evening and proposed to make a tour of that garden .
My guest Jackie was adorned with a jewellery and immediately she spoke , so that she was excited .
Inspired by all the palaces and palaces including lighting .
Everything is beautiful .
There is no wonder in getting the Amman Garden award because everything is of modern artistic nature .
The manager gave us our morning agenda.
First of all we set out on walking with Babu and then on a jeep for Bangkok .
After walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbhakt in which sunlight was spreading gradually .
Looking at the dry lake , farmers were growing in it .
This year due to no rains we had seen the field of tobacco for the first time .
The atmosphere of this kind of situation in the rural life of Jokne had been a unique experience .
After that we went to Bangkok through a jeep .
In the morning I kept sitting very carefully on a tourist spot in Halanduvan .
These are the invaluable moments of billions .
From the Aman Garden as well the tradition of Alvita has been preserved which has been preserved in the form of jaggery and curd .
Tourists can now understand why they are spending so much here .
I was told that a group of tourists is formed to see the life of tribals .
What is this right .
Certainly it is found in some other states and tourism shows special interest in it .
This tour is usually organised from 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
How to take food from there .
This way an attempt is made to do such explanations where there is not much development and there is no particular opinion of the nature and the life style of the people there .
At the same time there are ancient tourist genre as well .
Besides this , attention is also paid to the surveillance of traditional cuisine .
In fact the lifestyle and tradition of that place are directly visible to such tourists .
Even though it is a bit difficult to imagine , but such tourism gives the feeling of excitement and a different experience .
It 's a lot of fun to go to Brussels .
Even if you see crowd here then you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can take even more time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with being inexpensive and peace loving all the time this journey definitely keeps a request for satisfaction from us .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some special thing when you can take a tour of any foreign destination by bus .
Find out the best tea before taking a ticket .
For students , military people , children , etc tickets are available here and there are arrangements made for both the people .
This way it is better to buy booking tickets for booking , that is why in the last trains arrangement of tourism in train is better then make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling , tell about the round trip .
Early morning expenses are less .
Moving goods is very important therefore keep in mind the importance of obesity and weight .
You either leave some of your products with a turmeric or fill it with electrical products .
Along with this take the enjoyment of insurance or loss from the tourist group .
Carry on-fax is comfortable .
Because it can be put in the rock above the seat .
During tourism while changing the luggage from the bus keep in mind the responsibility of yourself .
Wherever you have a bus go ahead one hour before that time .
If during the busy season you keep this thing in a special time .
Actually the sooner you will go the better settlement is with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
Take the posterior side too much but reading in the front posture is not comfortable .
If you have to keep yourself frequently urinating then take a distant umbrella and do not want to put much trouble , then it will be better for you to take a seat near the door .
Now this is a tactic .
If you sit on the seat of both the sides then first sitting on the seat of the corner keep your back on the other side .
Therefore if there is not much crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if there is facility of washroom in the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind that it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information .
Everybody gets expelled while cleaning the woman .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat because if it is lost then the person in the hospital will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stands , return back to the time .
If you do not go on time then you can see a new traveller in your place and you will have to wait for another bus .

But this Diwan-e-Khas of 12 - 15 seats , is excellent for roaming Arctic Palace -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
We do n't know when it starts running like a speed boat in the lower part of the water .
You will not get an experience of flying in the airplanes of normal airplanes while traveling on it .
Each time you will see below the window that under the separate settlements of Maldives stir up the spring islands and coral islands in the water .
All of them are so many two client companies .
There are two C-Blane companies in Maldives .
There is a good place in Trans Maldives in which there is a sea plane nearby .

If you are going to Valli island from Maldives then it is necessary to travel to Ceylon because it is common to travel between different islands .
And if you fear that this is a journey by which there will be danger then do not travel in it .
This island of Maldives .
We were in the most interesting and chauvinist shops of the capital of Ahmad Bazar of Maldives .
All the Chaldeans have been listening with great care to the lectures given by the patron of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the Cave Hall one day before .
I believe that no Indian has ever heard of the speeches of the President or Prime Minister of India with such care .
But when there is a challenge on the surface of a rare earth then such fears are necessary .
Some people reach Maldives through the cabin of Maldives very well know the mantras of reaching inside through the water , go to Maldives because the world becomes so impoverished by taking away the wrath of nature from us .
The beauty of this place is somewhat special .
There is no such mausoleum in that small country .
After visiting the market people start returning towards their guruj jetty and after compulsory roads start taking dinner in the sea water because the people here know this charming limit .
Below the light of Lamp Pongt the fishes swimming in a few metres deep showing their colors .
This is a sea shore which is attached with the city for a time .
If you are able to see rivers and sea water contiguous with some city of India then you will be happy to yourself .
M . . . keeps on roaming around in Jagannath for two hours in the evening after returning to Aquamorin .
Corbett National Park is spread in an area of 87 square kilometres in the Andaman district .
Till now you will find rocks and cotton pieces of stones attached to the burial pit .
After listening to the speeches of President Nasik we were standing outside some government huts .
We were in the forefront of the residence of the excellent president of a country till far no security was there because we could not believe it .
When we stretched our hand inside his horrific gate , we were taking photographs on the garden and roads about 50 metres away .
Can you imagine taking an ordinary head home in India in such a way
It is said that the president had come to his office before two blocks while crossing the road on foot .
In the matter of Maldives every thing has to be defeated .
That is why I had the expectation of being patient the next day .
It was necessary that the day should be specially for good work .
In the morning a boat from Guruji used to reach till Air Force Jalland .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around in Ranway .
Later in the evening as soon as Guruji was coming out from Maldives , we immediately recognized the cliff coming up .
We were watching such maps .
But then there was no doubt that next day there would be an opportunity to pay attention to it .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we had to go to Rangali island at a distance of 500 kilometres .
Canberra had forgotten hundreds of sages and Koral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from Cuba flying till the height of approximately 1000 m .
One does not get this beautiful water anywhere .
It is a thrilling journey with thrill and enthusiasm to stop breathing .
But after going to the Hillton Hollywood Sinnare Resort in Ranchi Island it feels as if we have come to some other world .
In such a world , outside the world , there was no relation with any other world .
It was difficult to get out of beauty or luxury life there .
Whether it is possible to walk on foot or by a battery drive .
On both the sides of the bridge animals were marvellous when going from Jetty to the main island .
Now we were unable to imagine ourselves with the natural beauty present nearby .
On climbing down several metres below the stairs we entered a glass room which was inside the water .
That half was actually a dining room .
Through the medium of glass we were able to see marvellous types of small and big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating and drinking in the decorated tables here makes you thrilled .
The fare of seeing this island by sea plane from Malle and drinking under water is 47 thousand rupees per person .
One does not feel like returning from there .
We were ready to float in the water of our passport .
We know it's not possible.
We returned with the same belief in our minds , sometimes luck comes to us sometimes .
For a long time a plan was made to go to Wali from Delhi but due to being busy in work this did not happen .
Because of the desire of wild animals from childhood we thought that this time Jim Corbett should not go .
In 2006 this became another bike after a biking of Yakong lake at some distance from Karthukla beach in Ladakh .
In the early morning of 27th December we set out from Delhi to Jim Corbett but due to some bustle we got down at our speed .
The journey between Hafloor and Khajuraho was really tired .
Snow falls from top and bad roads ahead .
Many a times it appeared that when it was going to fall .
We reached Khajuraho at 8 o'clock in the morning through a road .
Fortunately we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is at a little distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Deccan near the park , which we had already registered .
After getting cold we went to see the beach of Kosi for the first time because of no special program .
After two - three hours we went to the museum of Corbett which was very difficult at a distance of 2 k . . from Thangdi .
From there we went to see Ramnagar for days down .
It was quite late in the evening to return .
We took a decision from Delhi that if we see the tiger left in the jungle then we will see tiger all night in dreams .
In the midst of a deep dinner I suddenly heard a loud voice and after that dogs did n't stand for two hours starting from roaring .
This is why Kaladungi and Corbett waterfalls first come on the way .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladangi where some folk artistic items related to personal life were kept .
Museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladungi
Returning here it has become about 12 hours .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this village only .
On reaching the hotel Safari gypsy was waiting for our arrival .
He told us that there are arrangements for roaming around in the first scientific bird of that place .
When we asked about the number one beach then the tigers used to come towards that side only to save the cold .
On reaching Bijarauli we were given a guide , for roaming around for four hours we had to take a hundred and fifty rupees .
We had set out to go inside the jungle .
We saw several types of animals and male - female species there .
Inside we saw two thick elephants , which had long teeth .
I made a film by standing .
In the midst of this the guide started trekking Philip .
The guide said that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park out of which some lions had died in one year .
At many places we saw their footprints but could not see the tiger , therefore I was sorry .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the lack of vision of tiger was continuing .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I telephoned him.
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
Did you see the tiger or not
His word became like an arrow .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
One told us that to go inside take a chopper away .
