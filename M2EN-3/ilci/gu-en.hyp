Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
As such this ' bid ' is its own script .
If you have to write kachhi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near only to Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have taken place and the whole city has been destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jasal Toral is very interesting .
If we come by the same route through which we will have to take more a month 's leisure and on the other side schools will open in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now we will take a ride on train by greeting the fast buses of Gujarat .
A small train of metre gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhubaneswar .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan 's economy is going through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and the increasing threat in South Asia tourism business has started to suffer a lot .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been registered very less during these days .
Fresh figures announced by the Rajasthan government recently show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics number of national tourists decreased by 9 . 87 percent and number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 total 26 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and 10 lakh 77 thousand and 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism sector are very worried due to this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holyday Makers of Rajput says that incidents of global recession and terror affect the tourism industry completely .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop the strong infrastructure of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After that tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent year has been the best for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , forests all are old to serve the tourists .
In the area of tourism the government does the work with the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
Along with foreign women tourists , incidents of rape and misbehavior in Rajasthan in recent years have also brought this state ' s image to an international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry to the state years ago but it has remained absorbed only in the papers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan Government in respect of tourism .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1987 .
This corporation provides the facility of housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two trains , Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has been spoiled for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels are not even 40 percent .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it very difficult .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wildlife .
This railway has not become an attraction of tourists .
Despite decreasing fare these tourists can not be attracted .
Similarly in recent years a dearth of tourists has been seen in Pushkar Fair also .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC this number decreased to 217 this year .
Among all this the satisfaction of RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Train .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC got a profit of nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Located in the area of tourism in Rajasthan due to this mishap the level of concern in the tourism sector is natural .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the heart of man then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has done the truth by settling the modern city Amboveli in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dreams that he had dreamt that he was progressing day by day , his eyes were shining .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of Ambe Valley private airport .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of an excellent city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 , 000 acres only 9  land has been provided with hotels , houses and other facilities .
Trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available on 91 percent land .
Many industrialists have come forward to build their own houses in this city constructed for crores of people and today there are around 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and emperors bought their residence here in the form of holiday home , now they have made it their first home and from here they come to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambel Valley itself is Koyarigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this region .
The broken ruins of Likawali in the western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the idols of lotus and Gods and Goddesses have been obtained which are mostly in fragmented state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this very area .
At this very place a ten - pillared idol of Devi Durgi is found .
Behind the renovation of this idol and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are popular among the residents here .
The remains of Devalapani are reciting the glorious saga of Arunachal even today .
The temple of Tameshwari Devi found in these remains is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient stories one gets the description of the month of Tamreshwari Devi .
The time of the Chetiya kings in the north - eastern hills is considered to be far - off from this goddess .
The tribal people here used to worship Goddess .
Sacrifices of humans were also offered here which were later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
In Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh some other ruins have been found .
This is called the ruins of Bhishmak city which is situated in the land part between the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular tales here this place is Vidarbha itself where once King Bhishma ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The Deeg , Mishmi etc tribes here give guidance to the travellers .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pool .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the aforesaid ruins described in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of the brick pond near Roing are still narrating their story .
Being surrounded by concrete forts on all the four sides by bathing ghats , cracks and another pond and getting wide the remains of wide roads is still singing its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from Northern Lakhimpur city of upper Assam by jeep for four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where one stays .
Before the construction of the road of jeep used to take several days to reach here .
On reaching here the views of trees of high deodar , beautiful primrose , volatile , wild cat , strawberry and rasbari enchant the tourists .
Apple and pumpkin are very rich here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kms at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the local people .
Due to their untiring hard work the wealthy people have made it their heaven .
Rice farming is very good here .
This place is the store of rice .
This ten mile long surface is a living example of their hard work and their cultivation efficiency .
The need for irrigation gets fulfilled with the Kali Nadi .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The eye falls easily in the redness rising in the sky on the horizon amidst the snowclad mountain range of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the coolness in the environment one also gets the feeling of moisture .
The sound of garbage under the feet is seen by the trunks of ice covered on the surface of wood .
There was no sight in the environment due to the fragrance of fog before sunrise .
The sight becomes stable in the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on the balcony lying on the balcony .
On applying the hand the sparkling cloth of the glass gets twisted with the sound of the common garbage and the hands get separated from the shock by the sense of cold .
This is the first experience of spending the night in this small village based in the midst of these hills covered with snow thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this spending a lot of time or spending near it .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and the dense population settled in the valley is spread far and wide on the normal slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone valley on both the sides of which are settled many small and big cities .
The road running along the Ron river and the vehicles running on it clearly appears to be visible .
At a distance of 300 kilometres and a journey of two and a half hours from the car the way to Geneva lake and half Ron river along the Ron river coming from east meets the Geneva lake which is called Lock lake in French near the city named Montro .
Geneva city is located on the western part of this 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide lake .
From there after becoming a river the lake moves forward towards west .
On the left side across the Sarwar are Dhaval , Gaganchambi Alps mountain ranges .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke from the exit of the left we move towards the north direction leaving this highway .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southward the sun is giving full heat to every corner of the afternoon .
In comparison to the valley the amount of snow is less here - almost no .
As the height advances , the density of the snow starts increasing .
There is no special cold in the air due to the clear sky and the shining sun on both the sides of the road .
After covering a journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular mountain road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Chalet is a large multi-purpose garden made of wood , full of slopes .
In the solder made of cement cockroach of three storied bungalows there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , washing etc . along with parking of cars .
Valiya is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of intoxication making alcohol .
Grapes are cultivated on 37  of the whole of the cantonment .
The orchards of grapes in the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a unique place to the beauty there .
Taking up to the garden of Grapes to roam there , resting at night in the villages there and enjoying alcohol in the factories of alcohol is an integral part of tourism business here .
There is a very big museum of wine in a fort built in 12th century in a small village named Age to see which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we come out amidst the same jungle burnt with jealousy .
The mind gets very upset with the questions being faced by the children on the entire road for three - four kilometres .
On one side a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley towards the left of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the slope above the village .
Above the skiing slope the dense forest of Deodar is located till the peak of the mountain .
Snow falls all around .
The roofs of the houses of the villages are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
There is peace loving here also .
White snow mixed from the peaks of the mountains to the valleys on all four sides .
Within five minutes from next we reach a big round in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Luckerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated with the fact that there are 1700 apartments and shops of 6900 beds , 28 hotels to stay for 1500 stay , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .
Source of hot water spring in Luckerabad has been found till today .
40 lakh litres -LRB- up to 51OC -RRB- water coming out of these are transported in the thermal bridges near the small and big 30 at places in the entire town , some bridges are inside five star hotels and some are according to the fate of people of various income groups .
On reaching the village one feels extreme heat .
In the bright summer the heavy surface of snow on the roofs of the houses is shining .
The name of Albenin is of this village .
Albenin village is one of the ' protected ' places in the form of national heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can go only by taxis , therefore no tests are done .
The journey is on , the region is different , but the mountains are same , the trees are the same , the good air is there .
The moisture that is rolling on the whole body is that itself .
It is the blue colored light in the rainy season .
On the completion of the project of Darjeeling journey first of all a fun was made to see Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of forests of Dhupi .
Famous for excellent tea production .
When we moved from Siliguri towards Darjeeling , then in the beginning tea gardens welcomed us to come towards ourselves swimming .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise hearts for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of forests , on the other side deep green valleys .
On this side sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
All around there was a greenery empire .
Once I got into a dilemma , see this natural jungle and see the leaves of tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful was the jungle , the more beautiful tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we look at the roads then it feels marvellous .
The circular path of snakes and circular paths were going .
Time was also passing .
If we had not passed then wilderness and tea gardens .
Sometimes a small population was seen .
From a distance only a mountainous house - house etc . started to look very dense .
This was Kurseong .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming all day .
Therefore taking a car we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge forests all around .
To reach the deer park i . . deer park from above the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being enchanted by the beauty of Kurseong the development of tourist spots has not happened .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite the passage being deserted the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of walking amidst the trees of Dhupi was giving us the courage to enjoy .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the British era lovers used to jump from here and give life .
Today , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a slopy dome here from whose height beautiful scenery is seen by observing the whole city .
In the nearby tea gardens women were engrossed in breaking the tea - leaves running with great speed carrying caps on their backs .
There is a museum outside the Kurseyag city on which we could not go there that day because it seemed necessary to roam around the free weather of this garden .
The next day Darjeeling had decided to tour .
This was definitely a thrilling experience between them , but there was a greater concern than this that if it was raining like this then how would we roam around .
But coincidence was very good that on reaching Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the blooming sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place brimming with wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
From here the Ganges got surrounding the hills a little below .
The view of waterfall between the wide rocks from here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we saw that waterfalls are visible in the colonies of rocks and stones here while the fairy world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is frozen with rocks .
Both these places are very low in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw the batasia loop in Darjeeling climbing up with the help of a car .
From here the whole of the hills and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Tantric .
The temperament of the weather was clean till now .
But where we moved towards Monastery , seemed less to be present and began to glitter .
In the evening program of touring and shopping was organised on the Mall Road .
Toy Train in the tour of Darjeeling increases the joy of journey .
Toy Train from Darjeeling to Gangotri and Gulmarg to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here boating in Mirik Lake and some rest in the garden .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters etc are found by Nepali craftsmen .
There is also arrangement for going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is although a city of Darjeeling district , but its colors are different .
Not only the greenery of tea gardens but also the commutation of forest - waterfalls is here .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lara and Lolegaon which are filled with forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling through the shadow of cold , but the tea gardens spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling had stopped me .
A small journey of my recent past was extremely interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither from a foreign country nor from outside Rajasthan , but very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which travels sometimes draw towards itself , sometimes or the other special place , water ship or some city like royal train or pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come out pulling themselves .
The place I am going to talk about is prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation the place where this place is located , that is why it has actually turned into a jungle .
Not only for people going there but also for people staying there .
My guide Ram Babu Meena resonates in my ear , Sahib could not even imagine before this that we can stay in the jungle like this .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people could not even get a job in heritage hotels .
Ajbgarh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now this wonderful royal look is in Aman Bagh .
He had embraced his calling in a new color .
Sahiba ' is an estimate of Aman Bagh .
Nobody calls you there by English address .
Aman Bagh is really a peaceful and comfortable tour .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to its nearby areas .
In the royal style of Rajasthan some people might have traveled to Bhangarh of ghosts .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad went there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there from Talku but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had forgotten the way and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly on the invitation of my foreign guests I reached there and felt that those people who want to take a magnificent pleasure in less time they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is a garden out of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp to hunt .
Its construction was done in the nineteenth century .
Its old wall is a testimony of those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Bagh hypnotise you .
Like you come inside the way you are welcomed , it seems from this that divine peace has been focussed here .
Along with tying a rabbit in Kanda the mantra of Manglachar is recited alive .
We had reached in the evening and thought of throwing a round in front of that garden .
The one who hosted me , who was an innovator , suddenly cried ' This is a very interesting ' .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . No wonder Aman Bagh got the award recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all a journey on foot with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on narrow roads we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw Sudhu lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rains but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For which such a unique experience of rural life was in itself a unique experience .
After this we reached Bhangarh via Jeep .
Early morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollars precious moment .
The custom of calling Aman Bagh a luxury was traditional , after feeding jaggery and curd he sent us farewell .
Now it came to be known why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that a tour package is kept to show the residential life .
Is this right .
Welcome and such happens not only in many states but tourists also exhibit a lot of interest in it .
This journey is usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this fooding etc are included .
This way there is an attempt to do shopping at such places where there has not been much development and where there has not been any effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this there are places worth seeing for ancient travellers , etc .
Besides this , traditional cuisine Pervassa is also taken care of .
Actually the goal of such tourism is to make the tourists experience the lifestyle of that place and traditions .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think , but such travels are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tours have their own joy .
You can enjoy strolling alone despite being with a lot of people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without breaking the book of your choice .
Yes , it is very important that along with giving a lot of time to less expense and peace travel also keeps on demanding your patience .
This is the reason that in order to fulfil them some things have to be taken care of , especially when they are going to some foreign places with the help of bus journeys .
Get a good package done before taking a ticket .
Students , senior civilians , children etc . get discount on this , then there remains a discount for two people as well .
As such buying tickets is cheap beforehand , that is why in the last moments instead of deciding bus travel it is better that you plan beforehand .
Get information about cycling journeys on both sides without tickets .
This is cheap .
Therefore the rules for the goods are specially stringent , so ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave your luggage at the station or you have to pay more fee .
Along with this know the rules of insurance and compensation from the tourism company .
Keep the bags together , take them along .
Because this seat comes right above the horse in the horse .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage will be yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat you will have .
While fixing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
If there will be more jolt on the last seat then it will not be right to read at the next seat .
If you have to go to urine again and again , then take the seat of corner and if you do not like to get very distressed then window seat will be good for you .
Now this is a moving point .
If you are in the fray of two seats then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus , then plans will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then keep this in mind while fixing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat because the buses do not take the responsibility of losing it .
Wherever the bus stops come back .
If you do n't come on time , then you can find new characters in your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if we did not see Rome in Europe then we did not see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its objects .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those ancient cities of the world from where civilization has developed .
This is the reason that their impact is seen on western lifestyle .
Rome , located on the Taibar river , is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion because the main ' Pope ' of this religion is in Rome itself .
Ancient Rome was located on seven hills .
In the fourth century AD a wall was built around it and a circular wall was built .
Their remains can still be seen around Rome .
Rome is famous all over the world for ancient buildings and their ruins .
This city having grand palaces , magnificent churches , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keeps you attracted at first glance .
Dedicated to the ruler of Italy Victor Emmanuel II this huge and unmanned building of white marble started in 1885 and its work was completed in 1911 .
In front of it on the horse of Emperor Imanuel a statue is built which had taken 20 years to be built .
Here the unmarried soldiers martyred in the First World War were buried .
The carvings of this memorial and the Vijay Marg built on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you have interest in artefacts then definitely see them .
Along with the memorial is not only of Rome but also of Italy 's famous and grand chowk ' Piazza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this chowk is famous like the Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this  Piyatsa de Spagna ' is also very popular among tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying  Piazza Venezia ' you must also go to the famous road of Rome i . . Via del Course ' .
Large shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the grandeur of this road .
It should be noted that this road is the main road of Rome .
This second building is built on  Capital Line Hill ' and is located at a very high height .
Famous sculptor Michelangelo of climbing on it was built in 1536 .
In front of Capital Line is the idol of Emperor Marcus Orelius , who ruled Rome till 160 - 1803 .
This magnificent statue will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on Capital Line is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and old temple is also built in Capital Line Complex .
The symbol of Rome is colossium .
This huge caves were constructed in 80 AD and 50 thousand audiences used to sit together here .
Gladiator i . . swordsmen used to show their art in Colosseum .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
Heart whispering warriors , whether they are with other warriors or with animals , continued till the time one of the warriors died .
In ancient Rome many ' Forum ' were there .
Let me tell you that light meeting places are called forums in Rome .
All the social , religious , economic , political etcetera activities of the city used to take place here .
Among these the most famous forum was Roman and the remains of Rajbhavan , temples and pillars are present even today at this place .
Obviously on seeing this an impression of the grandeur of ancient Rome takes place in a better way .
Pathiyan : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
Amidst its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
Because of this place devotees feel such as if their prayers are reaching directly to the gods .
Inside the temple statues of gods and goddesses are built all around .
Incidentally this temple was made a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Villa Borgis is a binocular .
Therefore while going to Rome do not forget to see it .
You must also go to the museum built here because by leaving it you will miss the opportunity of getting face to face with the best sculpture .
The idols made here are unparalleled and look so lively as if they have started speaking now .
Here a idol lying on a bed of Napoleon 's sister Paulin , whose marriage took place in the Borgian royal family seem so alive that you will not be able to stay without seeing it for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is their fountain .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which grand fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevy Fountain ' .
It is believed that if you want to come to Rome again then you should put a coin in fountain with this wish .
It is believed that by doing this the desire gets fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not complete until you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since sixth century this place has been the residence of Pope , the highest religious head of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome only but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
You must see the famous St . Peter Church of Vatican City , St . Peter Square , Fountain , Museum etc .
Of course you will get to see a different world and you will feel yourself to be remembered forever .

After this if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the actual beauty of Maldives then it will be a bit smaller even if you stay in Male .
Cicroscope proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis cruise started the only sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Crocodile is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis cruise has abandoned its services recently but there is a possibility of its recurrence from October .
You can go on a trip to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per night on the ship of Louis cruise MV Equamerin .
That is the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if the children of less than 15 years of age are two then totally free .
What else is needed .
Tea , snacks , meals are included in the fare of cruise .
With entertainment of every time .
On reaching capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a sea plane stands before you while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But with 12 - 15 seats this tiny oater plane is excellent indisputably for roaming in an island like Maldives .
When it flies in the air like a speed boat on the surface of the water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes go below the window , watch the resort islands and coral islands in different blue waters of Maldives .
Everything is clearly visible .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Transplantation is one of them , which has a sea plane .
If you want then you can take an air journey of around four thousand rupees -LRB- a person per hour -RRB- or you can take the entire sea plane on rent for a day 's journey -LRB- really big -RRB- .
As such if you go to an island before Male island then a journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey that perhaps you will never feel like completing it .
Sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- excellent monastery -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest ancient and memorable shop in the capital Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the sellers were listening carefully to the speeches delivered by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Weather Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a superior structure of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people might have understood the meetings held in the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it feels as if the wrath of nature is snatched from us then how mild the world will be .
There is something special about the beauty there .
It does not seem as if such beauty has not flourished in this small country .
Returning from that tour of the market they came towards the Jetty to go back to their cruise . When the eyes went towards the sea water walking along the road without reason then we felt as if the people here understand the value of this beauty to a great extent .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depths of many metres below in the light of the lamppost were watching with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see a few centimeters in the sea or river water contiguous with any city of India then you will consider yourself fortunate .
While returning to M . . . Equarine the hustle-bustle of Male was roaming around in the brain for two hours in the evening .
Coral reef -LRB- stone of coral -RRB- is the life of this place .
Even you will find stones of coral on the stones carved on the tombs .
Just a while before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there were no security personnel for a long time .
We were enjoying taking photographs of gardens and Agashis about fifty metres away spreading our hands inside through the gates of their bungalows .
Can you think this way about the houses of any common leader in India
It was also known that at some point of time the President crossed the road and reached his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about Maldives was astonishing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day with patience .
It was known that that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached at the crossroads of the runway at the base of the Trans-Mallian .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing from above .
He saw so many pictures
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance to ride on it .
We had to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres away from the Sea Plan of Tras Maldives .
From the sea plane flying till a height of approximately thousands of metres it was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling and exciting flight to stop breath .
But on reaching the conrad resort of Hilton hotels on Rangali island it felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
The relation was also not that it was difficult to get out the beauty and glitter there .
One can walk on foot on the conrad or also by a battery driven car .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was magnificent .
Today we were unable to hear ourselves from the nearby nature , reaching such a place , was unimaginable .
We reached such a glass room as it was inside the water as it was several metres down from the bridge .
That room was actually a meal halt .
All around we were able to see a unique type of fish , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of the food sitting on the decorated table there was extremely thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and underworld lunch on this island in Male to Sea Plane is only Rs . 47 thousand for a person .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to play in our neighborhood water .
But they knew , this was not possible .
Returning back with that desire with a heavy heart at times , at some point of time luck will come here for sure .
For many days there was a plan to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
From childhood when there was a hobby of wild life then thought why should not Jim Corbett go this time .
After biking from Khardungla in Laddakh to Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla this was the second line tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog that set out with excitement surprised us .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Flakes from above and bad roads in front .
Many a times it took place that now it has fallen .
After doing anything we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Although we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
I was in Dhikuli near the Amara Resort Park which we had done earlier .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we first came to visit beside Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we went out to the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres near the Dhangri Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening while returning .
We had set out from Delhi that if we saw lions roaming in the jungle then we would see tiger all night .
In the midst of dense nights suddenly I felt a great thunder and after that those dogs who started eating did not stop for two hours .
Therefore in the beginning came the suggestion of Kaladhungi and Kabert waterfalls .
Kaladhungi is 30 kilometres away , while Corbett waterfalls falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to his life are kept .
It was half past twelve o'clock .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was coming to this village only .
Safari jeepsy was waiting for us to reach the resort .
It was told that they had arranged for sighting in the number one side Bijrani there .
Asked about number one , she said that there is more grassy land and during this time tigers come towards this very direction to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees to roam around for four hours .
We had to leave for the jungle inside .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two sticky elephants , which had long teeth .
I photographed very well .
In the middle of it the guide started following the tiger .
The guide said that there are around 150 tigers in the park out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the signs of their feet but I was surprised to see the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
The ghost of tiger was in my mind at all .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I phoned him the same way .
I told him that I am in Corbett .
He asked whether he had seen the tiger .
Its words were sounded like arrows .
I said gradually , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us that you take a safari for inside .
