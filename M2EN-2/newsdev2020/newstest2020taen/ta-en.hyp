Bosnian opposition to the Croatian Access Plant
Hundreds of people gathered in northwest Bosnia on Friday protesting against Bosnia's neighbour, Croatia, saving a portion of the waste from the only nuclear reservoir in the region, near the river famous for its border and natural beauty with Bosnia.
Demonstrators in Bosnia Down Novicrade urged Croatia to abandon plans for savings at the old military settlement in Tgoska Cora and pledged to fight against the plan.
The waste of the Krusko nuclear reactor will be stored at the site.
The Bosnians, who came with the text of "I need a healthy future" and "We need to stop", said that atomic wastes will comfort you and create danger to 250,000 people living in that area.
We have to say no
This was stated by Mirroslav Dyreljaka, President of the Novi Great Corporation.
We must fight to protect our lifestyle and our daughter.
Croatia owns this factory in the 1980s, located in Slovenia.
Officials of the two countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste deposits.
Croatia's national HRD television announced on Friday that it was not yet decided whether Croatia would provide its own storage facility or to pay its share in the savings that Slovenia is creating.
The Croatian Environment Protection and Energy Minister Domislav Goric told the broadcaster that Croatia had a problem in eliminating institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and was seeking a complete solution.
Activists, officials and residents from all parts of Bosnia, who have different races, have urged Croatia to choose another part of the nuclear plant.
"Why was Tgoska Gora, a part of Bosnia excluding all parts of Croatia," he asked.

What is Manchhasen's bi-proxy in the policeman coming to Netflix
In such a situation those who take care of the child or those who take care of their parents are sympathetic to their own health .

This narrates the story of Beton Hobbert, who wants to be the US chancellor - but he should be the president of his school student house.
Ryan Morphy, the creator of American Harr Story and Glee, includes Wayneth Paltro, Ben Blatt and Lucy Bladen.
Manchhasen's bi-praxis is a reference to the fact that the person who takes care of them is really healthy and acts like a physical or mental deficiency.
There is a variety of ways in which the person pretends to be unhealthy.
However, Manchhasen's physics is particularly pretending that a person who takes care of is not healthy.
It is also known as a well-produced or induced welfare deficit, and is classified as child abuse.
It is rare that a parent is involved in exaggerating the symptoms of a child being unhealthy or producing symptoms.
What are the symptoms of Manchhassen's bike fractions
The NHS suggests that the symptoms of the situation may be different from each other, but the following should be conscious.
If your child is healthy, it is unhealthy to accommodate medical experts.
Exaggeration or lying about symptoms.
Changing decisions to show that the child is not well, for example, clucose in urine models to produce diabetes for them.
Promoting symptoms of unhealthyness, e. g.
Can you see Manchhasen's pie fraxy too much
It is difficult to know how much this situation is spreading because it is not very external.
In a 2000 study, 89 people were calculated to have this sign in two years out of 100,000 population.
If you think that a child is in danger then what should you do

The police accused the children of being kept in an unmanned environment, which was denied by the school.
Introducing himself as Sehu, a teacher at the school said, "It is not true that the children are all here with the consent of their parents.
Parents signed a course before they were admitted to the school.
Parents are used to feeding their children every day and they are aware of their condition.
We were surprised to know that the police came and evacuated the children before closing the school and removed the food for the children brought by their parents.
This is unjust because we have parents to testify whether their children were kept in a bad condition as the police say.
Earlier, Commissioner of Police Abdur Raghuman said that there was no complaint when he visited the school to see how children are maintained.
He said he did not read anything other than kuran.
However, the police's Public Relations Officer, Yakub Sabo, said that the children will be reunited with their parents after being handed over to the state government.
"They have been kept in a humane environment in the name of 'Guran Pathaku'.
Many of them have skulls on their backs indicates that they have fallen.
Therefore, we are inquiring into the school to know who is the owner of the school.

There are strong protests on behalf of Vijay.

In such a scenario, Vijay's father, S A Chandrasekhar, arrived at Thiruvananthapuram Airport from Chennai today to attend a function at Nagar Mandir in Kanyakumari district.
The reporters asked him questions about the criticisms he had received from Vijay.
He replied: Subhasree died in an accident when he was going on a bike on the road.
Everyone is talking about this incident.
Vijay spoke about one thing that everyone talks about.
The court itself has asked why he has not yet arrested the participants in the matter of Subasri.
But I don't know why the ministers and the elite are protesting only for Vijay's remarks.
If Vijay gets so much opposition, he will grow.
If you speak, will there be so much opposition, or not

The girl, who is being treated at the hospital, is a dog-like scene in the video.
We asked the veterinary physician Anandapadmanathan whether the foul smell of foul smell would act like a dog or whether the news spreading in Wattspaper was true.
If the dog suffering from rabies virus bites, the virus will surely affect those who are bitter.
But if the tongue is scratched in the body then the rabies will not spread.
Perhaps the rabies hit the tongue with a nail nail skull and the disease can spread.
If there is an injury and an injury in the body of the victim, the disease will spread even if the tongue is affected by rabies.
Therefore, it is better to use rabies vaccine as a precaution for dog-growers at home.
Animal doctors are also vaccinating once a year as dogs have to be treated.

Terrible Central Coast Guard Order to View View View Viewed Victims
The person wearing a leaf-covered Gilli dress was dragged from the back and dragged into the buffaloes when the 12-year-old child went to the central coastal school in May 2017.
Then he tied the child in a tree and committed a sexual assault.
In a short span of time after the arrest, a search order was issued at a house, which was seized by several officials over the investigation.
The person acknowledged three further allegations of assault and cheating and sexual assault between August 2016 and April 2017.
When the victim was walking on the 12-year-old lady's path and looking back, the man suddenly emerged from the bulls with a big tree and a knife in his hand.
When the child shouted "Stop, stop, stop," he threw his head away and threw it into a small room.
And the man told the woman, saying, Ush, don't cry.
I will injure you.
He put a knife in his right hand and tied the woman's hands and feet with cable carpets and then tied it on a tree and committed a sexual assault for about an hour.
And it came to pass, when she had released the woman, that the woman weeped and ran to the school.
Without answering a number of sympathizers and telephone calls, the person came to work at around 9.30.
He came in his clothes with dirt, grass and trees and said that he had driven another driver into the bushes on the road and fell down on the lake.
The trial of the person's sentence continues on Tuesday.
Pope Warning to Technicians to Use Artificial Intelligence for common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned technicians, diplomats and financiers that the race for creating digital advancements in artificial intelligence and other forms must combine a regulatory assessment of public benefits, otherwise it would pose a threat to rising social inequality.
Pope addressed a Vatican meeting with philosophers, philosophers and regulators to bring together embassies of the Government and representatives of Facebook and Google.
The remaining participants were academics and artistic philanthropic participants, entitled Common Good in Digital Era.
The three-day meeting is the latest evidence that Vadighan wants a place in the discussion on artificial intelligence opportunities and dangers.
The debate included the future of work, as the dependence on technical advances and machinery of the war system increased, and the decisions taken by social media after the Christcherch massacre in New ealand and the spread of the video of the massacre.
At the beginning of the industrial revolution, he praised the potential of technological advancements, describing machinery as protecting workers from dangerous and slackening jobs.
He warned, however, that reliance on robotics only on profits would be a threat to human beings with the dignity of serving.
If technology advances due to transparent inequality, it will not be a genuine and honest progress, he said.
If the so-called technological advancement of mankind becomes an opponent of the common interest, the dominant will lead to a tragic setback to the barbarism of law.
The organizers of the meeting said that in technical matters, the Catholic Church wanted to obtain expertise from the participants to explore future consultations.
Martin Odegard, who had borrowed Real Madrid, helped to attract fans.
Martin Odegard's help split the mouth for the first call of Michael Oirezbal.
The Royal Madrid team, which continues to defeat any domestic competition this year, went to the top of the La Liga competition following a 2-0 victory with the Osasuna team.
However, because of the pre-Season turbulence and explicit resistance to Wellswearer Kareth Ballet, its manager, Jinnah Jiden, was under tremendous pressure even if La Liga did not lose one of the rivals in the season.
The pressure reached the height after Paris-Central German (PSG) lost humiliation in the Champions League.
But Jinnah's Gitten and Real Madrid teams have some genuine talents, some of whom are currently in the French plans, some of whom are not.
Vincis Junior, a star in the future of Real Madrid, is now in the ranks.
Martin Odegard, another Norwegian lender who has been credited to the Real Spirit team, however, is making a furore with the fascinating help made by La Leega at a competition.
When playing for a real susedat team against the Allowance team, the Royal Sosidat team, which won 3-0 in its own homeland, split Martin's aid for the first call of Mill Orgebal.
After getting the market on the right, the opponent cheated a man and kidnapped him to the market and dragged a very large ball between the two and helped his comrades to smash the goal.
William Jos's second goal and best player Oyerzapal's third goal this time through the Bennetty Shoot gave a simple victory to the Imanolian troop, with a five-minute prematurely finishing minute drive, Alavs' juryman Manu Garcia was expelled.
Martin Odegard joined the Royal Madrid team in 2015 at just 16, but could not meet the expectations.
Now the 20-year-old Norwegian youth seems to be playing well in a way.

Boris Police Monitoring Organisation recommends bonds with Geneffar Arguria
The Independent Office for the police behaviour is now estimated that the prime minister should be questioned for the criminal offense that had been wrong in government office when he was the London mayor.
The Greater London Athariti (GLA) surveillance officer has registered a case related to action, in a statement, on the charge that Ms. Arjuni was given priority by his friend with the Prime Minister.
It said that there is a matter of action when there is information that a criminal offence might have been committed.
It does not mean that this was proved in any way.
The IOBC will now consider whether the matter should be investigated.
The matter has now been recommended to the IOBC, which deals with complaints against police in the UK and Vels.
At that time, it was recommended to the Monitoring System as Mr. Janson was the equivalent of the Police and Criminal Commissioner.
Mr. Janson has denied any fault in relation to his friendship with Ms. Arguri.
He stressed that he had accused a guilty person, but he had earlier agreed to the order of the London Legislature to give details of his relationship with Ms.
Seven years ago, Ms. Arguri, immigrant to London, was awarded 126,000 from public funds, after the Sunday Times report that he had been allowed on concessional basis for three foreign trips led by Mr. Janson during his tenure as mayor.
Thereafter, the government has put an end to the review of the decision to grant 100,000 subsidies to Ms. Arguri's company Hacker House.
It faces grave questions about the pre-monetary verification processes.
Digital Minister Mat Varman said in the General Assembly that his department had done the necessary routine procedures, which had a British telephone number.
However, the telephone calls, Ms. Arguri, 34, have been transferred to the existing California office.
Prime Minister's Office PMs friendship with a woman industrialist, "Everyone knows the secret"
The action of the GLA, which recommends the Prime Minister to the Office of the Independent Charge of Police, has provoked anger over Net 10.
This is a "politically provoked attack" and the Conservative Party convenes this time, a senior government news source said, "Open Politics".
'There is no evidence provided by the surveillance officer about any allegations, and no opportunity has been given to the Prime Minister to respond to the surveillance officer before the news report is released on Friday night.'
The public and the media are well aware that this was transparently distorted with political intent.
Mr. Janson's close association with the California businessman with the help of London's Tourism Development Agency was earlier referred to as a secret to all its employees.
Former officials of the London Partners (LP) agency recalled how the companies of Ms. Arguri were at that time reminded of Ms.
In the death of McMiller, the third was accused of having narcotics.
Las Angels (AP) - Last year, a person has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking for excessive drug addiction.
Court documents reveal that Stephen Walter is suspecting Stephen Walter selling illicit oxygodon pills in Fenton, which Miller had, accidentally in September, before he was able to exacerbate and die in the mighty Obian-Fenton, which caused thousands of deaths in Cocaine, alcohol and the predatory disease in the US.
Walter has been charged that another person, Cameron Petite, has given Miller pills.
The court documents released on Tuesday claimed that Walter had obtained narcotics from August.
Earlier this week, Ryan Ravis, who was arrested at Lake Hawasu City in Arizona, was charged with acting as a "Runner" involving pills for the box.
None of them was directly charged with Miller's death and none of them made an appeal.
Walter, who was released under surveillance in a 2005 drug case, has already been ordered to undergo a five-month jail term for violating the conditions of his release.
Lawyers dealing with the case, the well-known portal TMESAT on Thursday, have said that Walter is in jail until the time of trial, as Walter is more likely to flee abroad.
None of the telephone reports sent to his lawyer were immediately reported.
On September 4, Petite was charged in the Federal Court, and his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's response is his depression and open talk about drug usage, which has enabled some of the largest people in the hip-hap to become fans.
Malcolm James Myers McCormick, a genuinely named Pittsburg, had a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grand, which ended in early 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a favourite video about him on his Instagram and released the song "Thank You Next", in which he was dearly mentioned.
Miller's death is also one of the deaths of musicians associated with the use of Obaid in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a fellow artist on the 3 Dors Town team, died in 2016, with a body of Fenton and Hydrocarbon.
The article revised Walter's first name writings as Steven or Stephen.
The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that 650 grams of paracetamol pills are sufficient for those suffering from dengue fever and there is no need to take it seriously.
The indifference of the chief minister has caused a major controversy in the state.
So far, more than a thousand people have been treated with dengue fever in the state of Uttarakhand.
Opposition parties, including Congress, are accusing the government of not taking appropriate precautionary measures.
In such a scenario, the Uttarakhand chief minister said that the government had taken sufficient precautionary measures and that the impact was low.
If he had come, he wouldn't be sure, but he also had a suggestion.
In response to 500 grams of paracetamol pills, 650 grams of paracetamol pills were taken and if they relaxed, dengue fever would flee.
The health department officials have said that those affected by dengue fever should not take self-sufficient medicines, but come to the proper treatment.
Just a few months ago, the same chief minister had expressed his opinion that breathing would improve if he was standing there while he was blowing the air from Pashumat.

I learnt how to make sports in a booty camp.
"Now, when I am thriving, I am fond of sports," said Hungry CN.
In March, his father added him to a 5-day boot camp for children between 5 and 15 years.
The camp, organised by the CodeFest International, was organized to provide access to emerging technologies such as Robotics and Venture Truth.
His father, Okbara Senior, said he used to play a lot of mobile games in the growing age of hunger.
When he was 4 years old, I bought a tablet.
He played Kentagresh and Temple Run too much," his father told CNN.
But after his father's plan to spend all the time in sports, he was hungry at the age of 7.
"As usual, he was playing a peacock in his tablet, so I was angry," his father said.
I asked him, 'You've always been playing and others thought of making a sport to play your game'
I was angry when I said that, but I don't know he took it seriously, he added.
Since then, he was very enthusiastic about learning how to make sports, so his parents bought him a fold and taught him the basis for making sports.
The hunger that he wants to become a scientist in the future is based on what his sports are about.
One of his sports 'Maskedo Mash' is available in the Google Blair store.

With huge technological companies like Google and Myrosoft increasing their investments in Africa, hunger and his colleagues are emerging as future indicators.
North Carolina Republican former president of the Republican Party is going to confess the crime for lying in the inquiry.
The court documents presented Friday said that Carolina's former Republican leader would confess to the court that he had lied to Federal officials who conducted a bribery inquiry into the main political donor.
The Federal Court of Justice claims that Rabin Hayes will accept the crime next Wednesday.
Heys has been told that he had made untruthful statements to the FBI agents who conducted the FBI investigation in 2018 in a document based on the fact that Hayes's attorney had signed as part of the Criminal Approval Agreement.
The Criminal Concurrence Agreement has been branded and does not really mention what charges he admits.
He was initially charged with conspiracies, bribery and untruthful information.
The state's chief insurance regulator, Hayes, a former parliamentarian, was accused of donating the election campaign and in response of a special concessional insurance officer's plan.
The officer, Krek Lindberg and his allies, have been charged with attempting to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Kashe.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, one of the state's top political donors in recent years, who has donated more than 5 million to the state and federal candidates since 2016.
Despite his criticism of Republican policies and its politicians, he also contributed to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to the email sent on Friday, asking for comments.
Cairns Davis, a lawyer for Hayes, did not respond to a further email sent on Friday.
In August 2018, when the FBI told the agents that he had never spoken to Gaze about the worker in the State Insurance Sector, the court documents filed on Friday said he was a liar.
But Heys actually spoke to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's demand for the transfer of personnel inside the regulatory agency.
When Lindberg asked for a meeting with Kaze, Hayes helped and Heys directly consulted Regulator about the bribe.
The accusation issued in April accuses Lindberg of seeking special concessions to his insurance industry and claiming that Kazeh's 2020 re-election campaign had given up to 2 million.
The accusation was that there was a demand for the transfer of a departmental officer who reviewed a company in Lindberg.
Republican Gaze Federal told intelligence officials about his attempts to bribe him and helped him to prosecute him.
There is no charge against him.
In a conversation with Lindberg and Gaze, a partner in Lindberg told Hayes to send 250,000 to Kaze's re-election campaign.
Hayes initially refused to pay attention to the excess amount, but at the end of the conversation, it has been accused of reducing criticism.
'We will do what you all want,' he said.
"Okay, let him do this."
The Information Officer for the Federal Lawyer's Office has not responded to further email to the Criminal Approval Agreement.
Mouthmark conceals the number of aspirations for testing efforts to improve the welfare of the beneficiaries
As the world's first testing effort to improve the well-being of the beneficiaries, there are no longer a few face-to-face beneficiaries of other registration options, responses and video concepts.
On the contrary, these options will be individual, and only those who have posted it will be observable following such a trial by Instagram in July in Australia.
The trial will also begin in Australia, starting on Friday.
This transformation is based on the opinion of psychologists that the number of choices is comparable to each other in the society, said Mr. Mia Carlick, Director of Australian Mockingham Policy.
"There are really positive opinions from many anti-crime groups and psychiatrists working with us," said Karlik.
This is to remove the significance of the number, in fact, to focus on the calculations of choices or repercussions, to pay attention to the quality of their discipline and the quality of their records.
He said that it is expected that people will feel more comfortable with the sharing of this platform without being considered a competition.
Carlic vowed that Mughal-based enterprises would continue to achieve the same measurements as before and the same perspectives they had previously approached.
Instagram, Australia, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland, cannot predict whether these tests will be carried out in other countries.
Mukhnool, who is the owner of the village of Instagram, did not indicate when the test could be done or whether the transformation would be made permanent.
We have received some initial suggestions from the public about this experience (Instagram), but we are still learning and taking care of it, he added.
Carlic said Australia has the most active "technologically intelligent beneficiaries" in Mukhshadweep and Istagram.
We believe that this will be a very excellent country to realise the best ideas about whether it is a valuable experience for the people who use our services.
Every person is grateful to the parents who have developed themselves.
The sacrifice made by the parents to raise a child is not the same.
It is a scripture to continue with gratitude even after their lives, however important it is to provide them all the help they need.
That's why Pidurgana was created.
He will mention this in many names like Darpanam, Pidurkaram, Anuragatan.
Thankfully, they will call it 'synonymous' because they need to do hard work (not forgetting) on the day of the last month.
The goddess is Thiruvalluvar, the goddess of the South Puladar is a hostel, the head of the eleventh to sixth Ompal,' says Thirukural.
The so-called 'Tenbuladar' indicates the late perspective.
As the world of ancestors is in the southern direction, they call the living world 'Tenbulum'.
Though it has been mentioned for several days for dedication, it is necessary to make a monthly sacrifice at amavassa.
Some of them are supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be suppressed.
Perhaps, if Pitthur is not performed till now, it is very special if it starts on the Mahalaya Movement.
This is the time when our ancestors are coming to the Earth as a whole.
Use sesame, water, lime, rice, banana and food during the syrup.
It is a scripture that the angels will bring them to the forefathers.
Idea has said that the ancestors who visited the world to see their children are returning to Pitthurlok today.
Today, bathing on the shores of the Tirthankaras, worshipping Pitthur and guiding them, helping the family live in prosperity and livelihood.

Concessions are made by Sri Lanka Earlynsh.
Lt Gen Sawendra Silva, Commander of the Army Staff, made a request at the time of the post of Chief of the Army Staff, which provided the facility of free transport of five kilograms of goods to the Sri Lanka Earlynsh marines abroad.

The Chennai High Court asked the Tamilnadu government why the government should not provide a separate reservation in government medical colleges for those studying in government schools.
In the private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu, 207 seats have not been filled up for NRIs, so they have been distributed to the respective colleges as administered grievances.
Thiran, a resident of Kowai, had filed a case in the Chennai High Court seeking proper consultation.
The case came to trial in a sitting consisting of judges Kripakaran and Velmurugan.
Shri V. Raman argued that a case filed by the Medical Council of India (MCI) will be sent to the concerned college on the basis of 10 students in one place if NRIs have evacuated after a three-phase consultation.
The list should be filled in sub-groups of the college rules.
But I don't know if my ear was filled in the bottom line of the list.
On behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu, Additional Chief Prosecutor Arvind Pandian argued that the list of vacancies will be sent to the colleges concerned with Matt Dume.
Only Merit has to fill the empty spaces.
But it is not known how colleges are filling up.
The Supreme Court has not issued any directions in this regard.
Therefore, he argued that the Justice Court should issue a suitable order regarding filling up of allotments to NRIs.
The petitioner's lawyer Velmurugan argued that 207 empty seats have also been sold for low marks.
Why don't the intermediaries send private schools to school and ask government medical colleges only for medical education, why don't the government provide a separate reservation in medical colleges, if they send a list of vacant seats, then don't you examine on the basis of which it has been filled up
Here the government doctors are paid less than my assistant.
We consider this as an injustice to doctors.
We also allow 10 different medical colleges in Tamil Nadu to be opponents in this case.
Students enrolled at NRI Consolidation sites have ordered that these colleges submit their score by October 15.
Pakistan's social media prominence punishes brothers in Guantee Paloch's honourable murder
Guanteel Phaloch, popularly known for his social media photographs, was murdered in July 2016.
Last Friday, Pakistani social media figure in the 'Gauravak murder' at the highest level of the country in Anantik proved to be a crime against his brother for the betrayal of Guind and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Famous for its fascinating cells in Pakistan, which is attracted by Western civilization, but deeply disgusted by women, Baloch was strangled to death in July.
His brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested.
A few days later, a press conference said, "Yes, I killed my sister and provoked her behavior".
In a long anticipated judgment, his lawyer Sardar Mohammed AFP told the court in the eastern city of Muldan that he had convicted his client and imposed life imprisonment.
He will be released to the High Court in Asia, he added.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar My, told the AFP that her son would be released.
"He's innocent.
She's my daughter, she's my son," he said.
Balochin's assassination was spoken internationally and the voices of one-on-one-of-the-boy-killing slaughter against the infectious horrific infections of the atomic society began to resume.
Women have been burnt, burnt, burnt and stabbed and strangled in order to make their family proud of the crimes like selecting their husbands or selecting their own husbands.
The killings were usually carried out by a close relative.
They may apologize to relatives of the victims under the Pakistan uiz (Blood Money) and Diyat (Punishment) Act.
Three months after the Paloch assassination, the parliament passed a new legislation enforcing life imprisonment for glory killings.
However, the judge's self-decided whether a murder would be regarded as a honourable murder, thereby enabled the killers to pardon and pardon.
In Balochin's murder, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But when they agreed to lose their son, they changed their minds and asked for forgiveness.
However, due to international hostility to the murder, the Pakistani government has taken a rare step to declare itself a legacy with the parents and improved the case.
The fading of the Pakistani cricket team and the attractive Scarlet dressing on the day of lovers are some of the most well-known activities of Baloch.
This led to his protests and threats, but to show themselves as idols like Kim Kartacian, they looked entirely new in a country seen as a political activity daring to empower women, including the younger communities.
The roots of the 'Gaurav' killings are in tribal social control, which are widespread across South Asia and may be affected by men, but they command the behaviour of women.
Today we are losing ground water a little bit.
Now we are beginning to realize the need for palm trees.
For this, the Pani Seed Festival is now becoming popular throughout Tamil Nadu by social enthusiasts and youth.

I am very privileged that the youngsters who coordinate the Prabhakaran revolutionary seed movement.
Edison, one of them, shared with me about their work.
The elephant of West Bengal, who lost his sorrows
Animal interested people said, 'In 2004 it was transformed into a broad gauge.
Thereafter, more trains are being run on this route.
Since the number of trains has increased, elephant losses are also increasing.
This area is the path of elephants.
Railways have taken note that elephants have died due to rapid movement of trains in the area.
Thereafter, trains were ordered to run at a low speed in this area.
The accidents have also been reduced.
Now trains are being run at a fast pace in the region.
We are demanding to set up penalties in another area.'
Speaking about this, North Eastern Railway officials said, "The area is about 15 km of railroad.
Slow movement of trains has been ordered to cross this area.

Social enthusiastics have said that in Tamil Nadu, there has been a halt for the past one year without providing a huge amount of aid to pregnant women.
Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme has been launched in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu for the benefit of poor pregnant women.
Within 12 weeks of pregnancy, 4,000 bank accounts will be given to the rural and urban nurses after obtaining PICM number after obtaining the name of the Maternity Financial Assistance Scheme (MFS).
Thereafter, 4,000 will be provided for the second installment before the completion of the fourth month.
After the completion of the delivery at the government hospital, a total of 18,000 subsidies have been disbursed to 4 thousand rupees for the vaccination period of 4 months and 2 thousand rupees for the vaccination period of 9 months.
Similarly, nutritional consumption of iron ore, dry berries, protein biscuits, ghee, almondsol pills, cashew nuts etc. are being provided to improve the fitness of women during pregnancy.
The scheme has been implemented to improve the health of the pregnant women.
The scheme was extremely beneficial for medieval and poor pregnant women.
Over the last one year, maternal aid for pregnant women has been stopped without systematic delivery.
Social enthusiasts said, 'The last 13 months have not been given 18,000 pregnant aids provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for pregnant women.
This has affected the safety of mother and child during pregnancy.
Borrowing and spending on maintenance of the child.
Only the nutrients have been provided, so far the funds have not been credited to the bank accounts.
In this regard, the Government has asked the Health Department officials that the first instalment to be paid by the Central Government is yet to be paid.
After the first instalment of Rs. 2,000 from the Central Government, the remaining Rs. 16,000 will be deposited in the bank account.
But they say that the Tamil Nadu government has systematically registered the pregnant women's applications for maternity aid.
So, the government will have to take an immediate deck to provide maternity subsidies that have not been provided for more than a year.'

Law disorder doubled to 40,000 displaced from Northwest Nigeria: UNECR
The United Nations reported Friday that the worsening violence has doubled the displaced from Northwest Nigeria to more than 40,000 over the past four months.

Ministers oppose Boris Johnson for an agreement with Brazils to reduce frequent demands
Fear among top officials around the prime minister is increasing that the time for major concessions is decreasing, with only three weeks for the European leaders' multilateral summit.
Ministers protested against Boris Johnson's demands for a compromise with the European Union, slashing his frexit demands.
Frasels has said that Mr. Janson's alternative arrangements cannot be implemented, there has been a barrier to negotiations on a new customs regime as an alternative to the Irish box.

Now the prime minister has to flip and take what he can get.
Comming's plan has clearly failed, not to be cynical.
We cannot fight everywhere.
The second cabinet minister has pledged to tell Mr. Janson that the former Prime Minister Teresa may try to implement the agreement if everything else does not exist.
The senior minister added: "If required, I would urge the Boris to put Teresa's contract downward.

Sir John Major accused the Boris of not giving importance to the talks.
In a compassionate speech, the former Tory leader said, "The Prime Minister wants us to enter into an agreement with Europe.

The Prime Minister's spokesperson acknowledged that 'no one should imagine, we have to go farther to reach the agreement,' he said.
When there is no agreement, the Ben Act, which enforces a three-month delay, 'intensively undermines our negotiating position,' the spokesman said.

There is no willingness to carry out a concerted programme for the principle and purpose of the Freedom Party.
The president told the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's Kurunagala district congress this afternoon (29) that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was not prepared to carry out any programme that would question the future of the party members in order to harm the policy and purpose of the SLFP.
The president also commented that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had met with a series of recessions in its history, but the people of the party did not face the party's destruction due to the dramatic activity.
Whoever claims that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has weakened, cannot accept it, and whoever is considered immortal in the forthcoming presidential election, they need the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as the power to determine the future president.
The president said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's goal was to seize parliamentary power in 2020 by forming a powerful government rather than elect an unofficial president in the future, according to the existing constitution.
The new government's aim is to build a country that is devastated by corrupt elites, a country that has been ruined by corruption, corruption-free democracy, freedom and superiority to foreign powers.

He said that he had taken action to oust Prathar from the post and appoint Mahinda Rajapakse as prime minister and that it was not his question that he could not solve the issues they took. Today, Mahinda Rajapakse said that he was acting as the opposition leader and the sitting of the members of the Peramuna parliament was the basis of a letter to the General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Speaker.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which has not been subjected to subordinate political accusations, is dedicated to the service of the nation and the people by maintaining the party's identity, pride and dignity in the times to come.

imbabwe: Signa fears skiing
A senior government official said that Dinana-Adibar Constantino Swenka had refused to offer the opportunity to become Chancellor at the time of the revolutionary heights, fearing that it could be a trap to empower the military to seize the regime in November 2017.
Last week, imbabwe Independent told Syenga to take over as chancellor after talks with him and the military during the revolution.
A senior government official told the social media, however, that Sivenga did not deny this opportunity by fear, but was able to understand Mugabe's plans to utilize it to prove to world leaders and African Union (AU) leaders that he had actually lost his position in the revolution.
imbabwe's 37-year-old regime was ready to hand over power to Sivanga, but Chancellor Emerson confirmed by government officials that he was a senior government official in the Chancellor's office and the cabinet office that he did not have Emerson Nangagua.
Government officials said that Mugabe had approached Swenka through an ambassador who felt that he was empowered by his hands.
According to the senior government official, there were three persons in the arbitration between the head of the military bureaucracy and the late former chancellor.
The official said that the negotiators included chancellor spokesman George Saramba, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Neberra and Roman Catholic Fisch Claric Fitles Mugonori.
imbabwe became another individual in the negotiations following his departure by former Governor of the Reserve Bank of imbabwe, Gdian Gono Mugabe, to offer imbabwe Defence Force (ESTF) commander Swenka as Chancellor.
Described as a symbol of Africa after life, he sought the intervention of other African leaders, while attempting to make the African Union unrecognised for the operation of the military.
The former (Mugabe) did not select the then CDF (Corporate of Defence Forces) to the post of chancellor.
The official (Jamwanda) wrote, "It was an unbelievable attempt to rectify the rapid development of the situation, which fatigued a part of the late Chancellor's family."
But the late chancellor believed that there was a slight political manoeuvre, which would at least correct the situation in diplomatic terms.
Recalling the general's pledge not to disrupt and disrupt the constitutional order, the change would have led to a confrontation with the African Union's stance on revolutions.
The late chancellor (Mugabe) believed that the then CDF would be trapped in the trap, thereby guaranteeing the general's words that did not disrupt the constitution.
Mugabe's hope is that the African Union, which, after seeing the entire atmosphere, was very furious about how to take it on the basis of its theoretical pattern of revolution, would have called it a revolution without any other means, and would have been able to believe that there was a need for military intervention.
Thinking of this, the opportunity was given to him.
Moreover, when the security forces felt that they were not prepared to defend themselves, the authorities said Mugabe had taken the action.
They said that Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter because the army warned him of the danger of being killed like Gadafi.
Military chiefs told him that he would not be safeguarded if civilians marched to his Fluor Rupee residence.
At that time he had two desires to defend his family and prove that the military was holding the regime.'
The then CDF and the generals correctly understood the idea.
The senior government official said that the ambassador (Kono) - through a powerful drive - isu tiri vamakwapa-makwapa (we don't show anybody, i.e., soldiers), was told that we were not politicians or politically contested.
According to government officials, the army has revealed that the military leaders in the area have no intention of eliminating Mugabe by their men in imbabwe, but that they are taking care of the 'giminals' surrounding him.
Considering the revolution and the continuation of the regime, Mugabe sought to use the same strategy to cheat Nangagua, who had been asylum in South Africa for some time.
Besides negotiating with the military, Mugabe demanded assistance from the region.
South Africa, which was a key figure in the process - not only because of their economy and regional strength, but also because of the then chancellor Jacob uma SADC, refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the military had entered the house of Mugabe, the South African forces would have reached Harare immediately.
The news source told the Independent that New Delhi and African leaders did not want it because they did not want it.

China needs a strong leadership, otherwise a policy note of 'snatching'.
In a policy note published Friday on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic that if China does not need a strong and united leadership of the Communist Party, the country will 'snow'.
The success of the country since the communists occupied the regime 70 years ago was for the party's leadership, according to a White Report by the Chinese cabinet newspaper.
The largest in China, its national conditions are complex and its administrative difficulties are rarely seen.
Without a united and powerful leadership, China would go towards separation, break down and bring a catastrophe to the world.'
Chinese officials have long justified the need for national stability to suppress the problems with iron suppression, as they suppressed the pro-democratic fighters in 1989.
i Jinping, the strongest leader to lead the world's second largest economy anniversary celebrations on Tuesday, further strengthened the party's regime and restricted the challengers of his power since he took office in late 2012.
The Military Modernization Programme under MSME has created tension in the region.
China is not looking forward to exporting its model of development or importing any other foreign model. It is not just peace, it is not a 'disturbance'.
Neither the Chinese gene is to invade others nor dominate the world.
China is being intimidated by the great powers of modern times, and the impact on war and turmoil has deepened, and China will never enjoy its sufferings.
China is celebrating this year as it faces the challenges of falling economy and anti-government demonstrations in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, in the face of a bitter trade war with the US.
The country will never 'divide' China's interests and will not compromise on its security and sovereignty.
'The threats of trade war and the continued increase in taxes are not suitable to solve the problem,' it said on business issues with Washington.
China is an old economy with a holistic industrial system, a holistic industrial bond, a broader market and stronger economic energy.
'Trade wars will never weaken this,' he added.
China is confident that it can confront difficulties and transform barriers into categories and create a new world.
It added that the US should look at China's progress with wisdom because China has no intention of challenging the US or being an alternative to the US.
The US cannot control China, and there is no chance of preventing China's growth.
The prevention and suppression of other countries will not strengthen the US to carry out domestic problems abroad.

So it is better to prevent dengue fever.

Navaratri fate, one of the main festivals of the Hindus, begins today.
Navaratri fate will be observed till 7th.
In Navaratri, there are nine days of leaflet, only after being a fast should they sleep on the ground without filtering food and milk.

Those who are unable to eat bread for the first time in the first eight days and can only have milk on the last day.
The mythology is that there are no other differences as simple as the navaratri frustration, as well as very beneficial.
Navaratri furnace gives a man a gift of money, corn, sustainable life, long life, health, heaven and peace.
Children must be blessed to those who do not have children.
Those who are relaxed in the study can achieve a higher level by following this chaos.
If those who cannot bear nine days were awake that night on ashtami, the goddess Durga would have kept their lives awake.

The objective of the program is to describe the three elements of the man who describes the importance of the navaratri worship power - education, wealth and heroism - captains Saraswati, Lakshmi and Durga.

That is, the Chinese government has charged the heart, kidney, liver and skin of those occupied in camps.
China denied the charge, saying, 'It is true that the body parts of the convicted criminals have been cut off.
In 2015, however, we halted it and the UN Human Rights Council's accusations were baseless.'

Tourist places are very polluted .
At 21.9 billion per year for the Australian economy, Sydney's biggest contribution to the tourism sector is the port of Sydney, surrounded by Obera House, Circular uay, Luna Barrel and a symbolic port bridge.
But below the bridge is a bitter truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the most dirty waterways in the country, of which 15 Olympic swimming ponds per year go to pollutants.
This staggering figure makes this place, which attracts tourists the most, one of our most dirty places.
According to a new video called the Sydney port further and below, the water surrounding Australia's most famous city is filled with cigarette pieces, plastic bags and bottles, dull shoes and clothing and dead animals - all of which reaches the port via rain water via Vadighal.
But it is plastic that plays a very important role in blocking our waterways.
Dr. Ketherine Taffran, Vice Director, Sydney Port Research Programme (SIPR) in a video released on the occasion of World Tourism Day, September 27, said, I am an antidote to this.
It looks beautiful to see, but it is one of the most transformed and dirty toilets on our coasts.
Every hour, about 1560 kilometres of plastic flows through our waterways, most of which come into the port through rainwater drives.
The port is in a very bad condition following a series of incidents of heavy rains, Dr. Tafran said.
One third of these wastes come through rainwater.
However, with 70 percent of the sea-borne plastics reaching the beach, the problem of Sydney port is as big as a iceberg below the surface.
Richard Nichols, the owner of the Manley Dive Centre, pointed out that he and his team had personally taken 500 kilos of plastic every year, saying, 'In fact, you can only know what is there if you spend time under water.'
If most people come to know of this (what is in the water), they will be shocked.
Too much... we find half of the plastic bags.
The remaining 50 will be at least plastic.
When you look at the port, it looks very beautiful, but people don't believe that there are all these plastic and wastes from below its surface.
Ossen Protect Deputy Commissioner and Managing Director, Ossan Protect, Germi Brahmi said that there are two ways of helping local and tourist to reduce the volume of plastic and waste that reach our waterways.
It should start from its source, he added.
We should be very conscious that we should reduce the size of our plastics and recycle them better, and that it reaches the ocean in the end.
If we make the sea waste, we are going to destroy ourselves because 50 percent of the oxygen that we breathe comes out of the sea.
It sucks 30 percent of carbon dioxide and food.
But it is very simple that we can fix this port and bring it to its old position.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.
The video financing TOMRA (TOMRA), as part of its broader efforts to alert Australians about environment protection and reducing the impact of natural beverages, is in consonance with a study on plastic and mental health released this month.
A poll conducted with 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 showed that 82 percent of the population was disappointed with plastic waste, and 25 percent accused the elderly of the problem of single use plastic.
While 93 percent of the 551-parents suggested that the concern over the sea-reaching plastic level was rising, the parents also reviewed the fact that there were four-fourths of the most worried.
Many participants said that we want to do something about plastic waste, but we don't know how to make a difference.

Dasmine developers can guide to treat cancer .
Researchers have discovered a turning point in the treatment of diseases that can lead to cancer cure by Dasmanian developers.
Scientists have found out how some cancerous cells hide themselves .
Researchers have discovered that this process is going on with the Dasmine Devils and humans also .
This discovery is expected to give new ways of treatment to cancer patients .
What is common with the Dasmanians and the Davines
Ophthalmic cancer cells.
Researchers, including those from Melbourne's Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, have discovered that some cancers have not responded to the anti-diabetic system and have helped in revolutionizing their treatment.
It may be a key feature of rectifying the dangerous faces that threaten the future of the devastating Dasmanian devils.
The study found that some of the cancer cells in humans and organisms were concealed by a group of proteins called PRC2, hiding themselves and preventing the anti-diabetic region from acting as an indicator of cancer attack.
This could be a major challenge in treating small lung cancer, neuroplastoma and merkel cells.
Peter Make Researcher Mark Dason told AAB that at times we can revert the procedure to anti-diabetic patients.
The anti-disease zone can detect cancer cells by changing the aim of existing treatments to carry out proteins called MH.
Prof. Dason said that it is possible for people with neural cancer to have long-term benefits.
This is one of the most common diseases in the world.
We will be able to treat this in a better way.
Researchers believe that this discovery can be ultimately used in the tumors of the Dasmanian television that prevents the discovery of cancer cells.
Accurately, the same procedure (in humans and in Dasmanian David Cancer) is being done, said Professor Dason.
Till now, it was very difficult to treat cancerous glands in Dasmanian.
However, if the drugs used by humans can also be used by the Dasmanian Devils, it can help in controlling the disease.

Scientists shout about roaming around a small star
Scientists are astonished to find a solar family, 30 light years away from Earth, surrounding a small star Red Dwarf, a huge planet like Thursday, thereby challenging the current understanding of the Earth's creation.
On 26th September, 2019, the art form of GJ 3512B, the largest gas satellite surrounding its smallest nutritional star Red Dwarf.
Normally, the stars will be bigger than the largest planets around them.
But researchers said on Thursday that the star and spear do not have a big difference in the event.
The star Jije 3512 will be 12 of our sunset, while the weight of the surrounding clay will be at least half of the weight of our solar family.
Carlos Morales, an aeronautician at the Gedalonia Space Research Institute, Space Science Institute, Spain, presided over the research published in the Science Journal.
The discovery was surprising when the theoretical patterns of theoretical composed of small planets like Earth and small neptunes.
We have discovered a small star surrounding a massive gas mission on Thursday, the Prime Minister said.
The planet, like Thursday, was explored using a vision at the Galler Altogether Laboratory in Spain.
It surrounds its star on its long-standing path for 204 days.
The Red Dwarves are small and have low temperatures on the surface.
JJ 3512 will not only be much smaller than our sun, but will also be about 35 bigger than Thursday, which is comparable to a large potato.
They are less powerful, dense than the sun, and their surface temperature will be less than 3800 (digree) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit 3,527 celcius).
That's why they have a red color," Morales said.
While there is evidence of a second planet rotating the star, a third planet may have been rotated from the star family in the past, which explains the length of the cliff like Thursday.'
The planets emerge from the same layer of gas and dust between the dresses that make the star around them.
According to a predominant model for the formation of planets, the so-called 'small growth', initially one thing is produced from the solid particles of the layer, which leads to a cycle from the gas surrounding the epidemic of the epidemic.
The unstable geopolitical pattern can be explained in contrast to this.
"In this event, the proto-plannery layer around the young star may be bigger and colder than expected," said Morales.
This makes the layer uninterrupted so that some dense areas can emerge.
These heaps can grow until they are scattered, making a planet.
In Tripura, the order passed by the Supreme Court on a ban on the killing of sheep and chicken in temples has become a big controversy.
The state government told the court that Tripura's promise was violated when it joined India in 1949.
1355 years and 184 Kings, Tripura signed an Agreement with India on 15th October, 1949.
The then Tripura Maharani Kanchan Prabha Devi and the Governor General of India signed the Agreement.
The main feature of the Agreement is that the Tripura government will continue to provide financial assistance to 14 temples, including the famous Tripura Sundari Temple.
It is usual to sacrifice sheep at Tripurasundari temple.
The government is also providing financial assistance for this.
This should not be changed. The main commodity of the Connectivity Agreement with India.
In contrast, Subhash Patarji continued the welfare case in the Tripura High Court, saying that the sacrifice of sheep and chickens with the help of state funds was intriguing the minds of Hindus.
Division bench judges Sanjay Karol and Arindam Loth, who have been investigating the case, have stumbled that they should not sacrifice sheep and goats at religious places in Tripura.
The court also ordered that the government should not help such sheep sacrifices.
The court has also sent a notice to all district magistrates and police supervisors to respond to the matter.
The court has also directed that temples should not be sacrificed except for sheep and chickens, and that CCDV cameras should be installed and monitored in all the temples.
Now the State Government is applying to the Supreme Court against the order of the Tripura High Court.
Indicating the rejection of the Tripura High Court's argument that it should not violate its promise when it joined India in 1949, the state government is going to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Accused of Teleworker for giving bean dips of Metambedam to co-workers
Medina-Hernandes of Marian County Sheriff's office, 38, has been accused of giving a co-worker a piece of Metambedam piece of bean dip.
The 38-year-old Kasandra from Albani, and Medina-Hernandes, were charged with the crimes of Metambedam's offer and the indulgence of one thing banned by another, both of which are B-section crimes.
Accusations have emerged as a result of the September 9 incident at the Trifdway Palace shop in Jefferson.
The 27-year-old companion of the suspect told Sheriff's aides that he had visited the lunch television and had seen the preparation of the Medina-Hernandes Pean Dip and had said he had to see something on Monday, which was the possible cause of the OregonLive.com confession.
The victim told the investigating officers that he had never quieted before, saying, 'The taste of a few sticks was different, but he didn't think anything about it.'
And it came to pass, when the woman returned to work, that she had a stomach, and her feet pushed.
When he went to a local hospital, Albani Temacrat-Herald said it was decided that Metambedam might have been on the bean dip.
The Smoking Gun said that the other tri-french worker had told the victim that he had supplied narcotics inside the diet, while a third worker said that the suspect had sent a minute message to him for fault in the bean dip.
In the video of the surveillance camera obtained from the telescope, Medina-Hernandes returned back to the camera and took something from its Brahmins and was reported to be bent behind Microve.
After he got up, he drove his nose and walked to a table and said he had a bean display on a small paper sheet.
The police said that the material from his Brahmin appeared as if it had been in the plate.
Sheriff officials said there was no reason to believe that any customer had been treated with dirty food, according to the Aregon Statsman.
Medina-Hernands has been jailed for 520,000 Jamin.
The Smoking Gun claims that Felan had previously been punished for theft, pavement, identification, theft, theft and theft of the Metambedam, and that Felan was punished for possessing banned weapons.

H. Vasantakumar, a member of Kanyakumari Lok Sabha, came to Thiruvananthapuram today to commence his campaign in the suburban areas of Nangunneri.
Speaking to reporters at the airport, he said, 'DMK and Congress volunteers have expressed their willingness to compete in long-term seats.

Despite complaints related to behaviour , the dramatical hotel has a licence of alcohol .
Washington (AP) - The Drug Control Board rejected the demand for a revision of its liquor licence due to the behaviour of the local Trump International Hotel owner.
The organisation dismissed the complaint on Wednesday, as the majority of three ministers, two vacancies and two rapists lived in the province or had no property in the province.
This is the second time that the Washington Post claims that the applicants must abrogate the hotel's liquor licence under the provincial law, which requires 'good behaviour'.
Referring to the charges and fraudulent methods of the attack, President Donald Trumb breached the legislation in the initial stages of the past summer.
It had already been rejected because of the licence.
The second complaint was filed following the renewal of the licence.

A petitioner's lawyer accused '207 seats and sold to low marks for higher sums.'
One report blames corruption-free Cleveland police for being branded as the worst
The corrupt police have been branded as Britain's worst police.
A report estimated that the Cleveland police were incapable of all matters.
Fil Komle, Constable Analyst of HM-In, says that the Gleveland police have been deteriorating at a definite level.
Now there are new requests for the dissolution of this force, which has seen five top guards in six years.
The report says it fails in attempts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the victims.
After our previous research, there is a significant deterioration," says Fil Komle, a researcher at HM-In.
The Chief Guard, Mike Wheel, has left for a year in January when he faced 'extremely serious' but unpublished charges of his conduct.
After being arrested on suspicion of the worst behaviour, Assistant Chief of Police Adrian Roberts was sacked.
Last year, Vice inspector Simon Harwood appeared before the wrong behaviour committee to prepare his colleagues for sexual relations.
He left the army.
Tory Mayor Pen Houchen of Dece Waley said: 'This is an official proof of the dissolution of the force.
Now it's time for the Home Ministry to intervene.'
Principal Police Commissioner Richard Louis said, "Progresses have been made and I am fully committed to guiding change."
Nancy Pelosi: William Far 'Pokkiri' has to be conducted without interrogation
You never know where we're going next.
I think we are now engaged in covering the cover, and it can take a while to investigate," said Pelosi in an interview with the CNN on Cable Hill.
"They will do the work they have done, following the truth and the time they find the truth," he said.
The White House's written column published this week showed Trump told Ukraine chancellor Volodimir Selensky to examine former vice chancellor Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate and the son of Biden.
The telephone column copied to Selensky that he had told Tramp to work with Par and his personal lawyer Rudy Gulani.
Drump denied that he had done nothing wrong.
The CNN reported Thursday that the judiciary had first warned the National Security Lawyers about the complaint of Ukraine-related trauma just a week before formal recommendations.
After receiving the complaint as a recommendation from the intelligence service officials, the Justice Department decided that there was no need to conduct a propaganda financial criminal inquiry into the telephone call of Tramph.
When asked if he wanted to testify, Pelosi said the intelligence service would decide on Friday to call for a witness.
He added that he believes that look has become a poker.
He has been like that for a long time.
In his July call with the Ukraine President, he referred to his Attorney General as "Trump, which is why all these (see) have been mentioned".
He is keen to take decisions on how the complaint will be dealt with.
Pelosi said he was very concerned about the data source of the secret, and attacked them on Thursday, saying that the spies were different in those days.
I think it was dangerous that the President said that the indiscriminate breach of responsibilities.
Pelosi said, "Those who reveal secrets have a key role to play in showing the mistakes in our government," the President said, "It is intensely doubting the government's honesty about those who have given information to the publication.
On Tuesday, Pelosi carried out a historic act of announcing a formal pledge inquiry into accusations that he attempted to pressure a foreign leader for political profit.
The telephone call was inserted in a complaint issued to the public on Thursday, accusing one of the secrets of misusing his authority in the upcoming elections of 2020.
The White House attorney told the authorities to remove the telephone copies from the storage computer and place them in a private system for secret information.
Christian Bentech: Christian Palace Striker faces a hurdle in driving
The Fremeier League has faced the possibility of a Christian Pentech vehicle running twice in a couple of months.
On January 20, the 28-year-old Chrystal Palace Striker acknowledged his departure to Pentley in southwest London at a speed of 80 a.m. on A3 a.m. in Richmand.
He joined the country of Belgium, then in March, the speedy surveillance camera was recorded at a speed of 89 miles, more than double the speed of 40 miles in Patna, southwest London.
Sirrey, Pentech from Kingston, has not been welcomed to the Lavender Hill Criminal Court this morning.
He acknowledged these two offences at the beginning of July, under a single judicial procedure that the judge decides on minor offences.
Kofi Manu expresses concern over the setting up of the Committee for Research.
Mr. Gofi Manu, a Football Administrator and Sgondi Hasagas official, has expressed concern over the forthcoming Gana Football Association (GFA) Electoral Survey Committee for Elections.
The chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank Davis, questioned the inclusion and said he was not happy to be included.
In an interview with GNA Sport, he said he had doubts about whether the Chairman of the Committee would act justly as he could benefit from the results of the review process.
The Review Committee should have neutral persons from outside without any contact with any member and should be unprofitable.
For instance, Mr. Davis was signed as an advocate for writing Osei Wahu Balmer on a 10 percent fee.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
He should not be allowed to continue in the study for these two reasons because of his advantage.'
Mr. Manu, who appeared before the Olympics director, Mr. Fred Papo, suggested that the connection with the Club would cause a contradiction, and suggested that if Mr. Paulmar appeared before the committee, there would be discrimination and discrimination.
After assuming office at a function at the GFA Secretariat in Agra on Thursday, September 19, the members of the committee are expected to begin their work tomorrow and finish on October 4.
Frank Davis, CEO and Law Specialist, Smt. Marian Barner and Imanuel Dharwa will be the members of the committee.
Mr. Reginald Laurya, Executive, Marketing and Industry and Mr. Richard Abokevi, Administrator and Lawmaker.
Rupa Gurunath, the president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, is said to have tried for the post as the son of former DMK minister Ponamai.
Various reforms are being made in the Cricket Board of India and State Cricket Associations as per the recommendations of the Lodha Committee.
The recommendations of the Lodha Committee include that one of the Cricket Unions cannot continue in office for more than two consecutive terms and those over 70 cannot come to power.
Accordingly, those already in office at the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association were incapable of coming to power.
There was a situation where new people had to be chosen.
Ashok Sigamani, son of Dimuga's former minister Ponmui, is said to have moved fever to take over as president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, but India has defeated the effort by Cements Srinivasan.
Without any other reason, Ashok Sigamani has accepted the post of Vice President.
She is the youngest son of Ponamai who is conducting a Child Health Hospital in K K.K.
Ashok Sikamani has been keen on cricket since school.
At one point, he was busy trying to join the Indian team.
India Cements Srinivasan is the reason why the Tamilnadu Cricket Association has been elected uncompetitively by the leaders and executives.
If it had been a competition, the granddaughter Ashok Shikamani Srinivasan would have duffed Rupa to take over as president.
When Srinivasan's side spoke of peace, he would wait for him to be the vice president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.
The archaeological department of Tamilnadu has been asked to hand over the Tamil literature fees to Mysore.
On Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) ordered Madurai to respond to the action taken to protect and revive the archaeologies taken from 27 Tamilnadu inscriptions.
The petition filed by Mani Maran from Madurai: The Department of Astronomy is under the control of the Department of Astronomy at Mysuru in the State of Madurai.
Ancient rockets and historical values in India are being preserved there.
The underlying documents of Tamil inscriptions are evidence of scientific confirmation of the history of Tamils.
Moreover, the footprints of the Tamil Nadu Tigers have been documented there.
In such a scenario, most of the old Tamil scriptures were damaged when they shifted the office of the Library Department in Mysore from the old building to the new building.
The inscriptions should be maintained in an e-mail manner to properly preserve and publish the historical documents.
But the documents related to Tamilnadu were not properly preserved in Mysore.
Thus, the history and heritage of Tamils remains unaware of the future generations.
Hence, Mysore had requested the Tamil script to be handed over to the Department of Literature in Tamil Nadu.
Visa came to Rani on Wednesday at a sitting with Sivaganam and R Tarani.
The Judges then postponed the case on 22ndAugust, by ordering the Department of Collections to respond to the action taken to protect and renew the archaeological symbols as taken from Tamilnadu.
Appeal for Integrated Tripura against Australia
Justin Divorc says, "It's time to show excellence" against the Australian team that determines the fate of the Wells Cross in the world cup.
The victory against the Australian mobilisation will make them the most possible march to win D-Private and confirm the possibility of collision with France or Argentina.
But if the Australian team wins the Wells team for the 14th time in the last 15 meetings, it will push the Tripura and the Military to confront the UK for the last eight seats.
"There is nothing to hide, the two teams will win and try to take the first position in the category," said Dipurich, a pioneer of the Wells Squad.
Some decisions were difficult in the past, but in the past autumn it was sweet to win against them (Australia).
I think they will be keen on winning us again, but at the same time we want to ensure another victory.
We know that this is going to be an important competition before coming here.
Now we have come here and it's time to show real skill.
In the history of the world cup, the Wells team has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African forces - the victory of the Australians in the Third Period just 32 years ago.
Overall, under the Chief Trainee Warren Gateland, only 7 out of 41 attempts have been made against three Southern Jambs.
In November, Wells stalled a series of defeats against Australia in the 13-Destination competition, one of the remaining 9-6 winners in Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Asked whether there was a mental obstacle before that victory, he added, It is difficult to say that.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... I don't know.
We left about 15 points at the end of the competition, so it would be harder to see the points than really did.'
If Wells wants to win, the fight for Divrich with Michael Hooper and David Bokak, Australia's renowned back row, will be important.
He is well aware of the fact that Dipurich, who played 67 times, has opposed these two soldiers in several previous competitions.
He said that those seven are completely world-class people.
You always know that competition will be difficult when fighting with world-class champions.
Both of them continue to be the best in the world.
You know what kind of competition you are facing.
One of the best men in the world to save the market, Bocca, Michael, is a slightly aggressive man, who has the right knowledge of Rakbi at the right time.
You have to challenge the world's best players rather than playing with the reinforcements.
You would like to play against the best of the people, and when you play against these two soldiers, you should be with the best lady.
I cannot say that the competition to be held on Sunday is a final contest, but this is an important competition for us in this world cup.
The team spirit is an important part of it.
It will be difficult to win you if you continue to play well and perform well.
Increasing Sea water level threatens to plunge into the sea in Chennai
The Standing Committee on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that four Indian coastal towns of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai are at risk of drowning in the sea.
AMIBAN AIBCC, which reviewed the Climate Change Strike of AINA, has released the Survey.
At the end of this century, melting of snow will rapidly lead to a massive increase in navigation.
This will pose the worst danger in 4 cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai.
At the same time, many parts of North India will face extremely severe water scarcity.
The sea level is increasing rapidly than before.
This will affect the world's 1.4 billion people by 2100.
In India, not only 4 coastal cities, but also 45 port towns worldwide, 50 cm high sea level, there is a danger of floods.
With this danger increasing every year, narrow seas and small islands are in bad danger.
Moreover, unless emergency measures are taken to reduce global warming, the temperature of the ocean will increase and the destruction of marine creatures.
There will be no sea food worldwide.
There is also a lot of potential for cyclones.
Ocean temperature has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
The Survey acknowledges.
Ben kisses Calam after Witney's shock
The tension between Kalam Havei (Donnie Glave) and Ben Midsel will erupt once again in Estonators, as Witney Dean (Shona McCarthy) overthrows the trauma and takes it back to her girlfriend.
Would they both regret the situation in which the relationship between them is bleak or angry
Callem recently told Pen that he was sweet to see his weak and soft side, while he and Ben were slowly handling things, as he helped to save Ben's livelihood and moved to help Baby Bear.
Tonight, Vitni is returning from a holiday in a better mood than he left.
Having learnt about his regrettable marriage and his deception of a man who would come as his husband, it became clear that his departure from Veford had given him the best advantage.
When he comes home, his mind is attached to footwear.
But soon, a fact that he reveals makes the inherent implications deterrent.
Jimmy Farthwick is worried that he started drinking again in Kuen Vick Poppin because he was having a bad footage.
When he is drunk and emotional, Kalam goes to Ben and fights against him all that he has.
Gallem's disappointment becomes an uncontrollable emotion, because he has been quiet and embraced by Ben's acceptance of the call and embracing him long before he kisses him.
But what will they then go towards
The heroine will try to go to dating next week, but Pen's intense thinking about his earlier relationships is a threat to all that he wants to do.
But after proving to his Homoeophobique father, the new self-confidence canal is determined to fight for one of his favourites.
The threshold is scheduled to be shown on September 27 at 8.30 in the BBC On-Istandars series.
In order to know what is under the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction the White House becomes full of fear .
White House officials are interrupting to decide on how to deal with the renewed efforts of the Democrats for the ousting of the post on Thursday, describing the situation as a 'complete panic' over the past week as there is no solution to the new issue.
A person close to the White House said that the allegations of the secret revealing could seriously affect the chancellor and his surroundings, so that the West appears to be increasing the 'disturbance, inequality and anxiety'.
"There is an unbelievable situation in which there is nothing," the person said.
White House officials are uncertain about what to do, not because there is no explicit plan for the situation, but because the usual methods used by the chancellor in the past to avoid disputes are not useful: 'It doesn't appear to be a matter of disappearance after the next news has arrived.'
Another person, who is aware of these suggestions, said that the White House has been shocked, and if the inquiry continues, the chances of the President responding swiftly and going to the uncontrollable level are increasing.
While he is expected to exert pressure on the President every day during the secrecy inquiry, he will be more conscious and expressed the same concern that some people around the Chancellor are expecting it.
It instigates the concern that the behaviour of the dramatist cannot be further predicted and unexpectedly counter-attacks - both at the presidential and political levels in the election year.
Confronting the unprecedented threat to his presidency, Robert Muller's ability to revive the war he had seen as capable during the Russian interrogation has shifted from the trauma-style to self-defence.
Returning attention to the actions of the Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Biden, the one-sided man, attempted to lose his demand to help the chancellor of Ukraine to investigate his political opponents through the destruction of confidence in him.
But as many of the White House have experienced Mullar's investigation, aiders and advisers have said this time has begun to feel differently.
One was aware of the situation that he had failed on Wednesday when he was considered as the President.
Happy with questions about Russian intelligence, they said that Trump appeared unconscious to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the chancellor's allies believe that this could be limited by arguing that this would reduce his credibility, while some of the chancellor's allies believe that he did not know directly about the questionable telephone calls between Tromb and Ukraine's chancellor Volodimir Selensky.
Moreover, as often happens, the fact that the chancellor has been in a blockade is that his truth instigates the loyalists to protect him.
But a close conservative to the White House said that the predecessor's basic recognition figures were already very high and that the recognition of new people would not be easy.
In the next four months, there is no good in paying attention to the expiration of the office of the President, especially if it dismantles his proceedings and makes the headlines.
Those arguing that the deputation could help the chancellor and that he was not fully aware of what his response would be.
The concerned White House officials are looking for advisors to assist in responding to the dismissal.
While efforts are still in the initial stages, the man said of the plans that the attempts like a war room would be effective or in what form it would be.
The obvious premier had the approval that coordinated legal and communication strategies were needed, in response to an attack on popular support against the publication of the wounded report by the observer and the publication of the report, responding to the pace of the Democrats' postponement efforts.
Foreign Minister Mike Pampio and Finance Minister Steve Nuchin said that they were not going to release a trauma call with the Ukraine President - after 48 hours they were regretted that there was no other way but to release the document and that the long-term vision was blatant.
Robert Muller, who spoke only through his allegations, is now expected to be more pressurized than during the trial, and a person who is expected to be involved in creating a reply to the post, said Core Lewandosky, a former campaign manager and tramp bit bull outside.
But it is not true that he presided over such an attempt, Lewandosky told NPC News.
"I have done everything that I have done for the past five years to support him and his plan, but I have not consulted the President about joining a team to oppose the falsification effort," he said.
J. Chekulo, who is the outspoken lawyer from the Muller trial, is also unconnected with the drive to take office.
On his comments, NPC News said, "We will deal with matters at a time," Sekulo said.
As Emmad Flat, who worked in Clinton's seizure and guided Mullar until the end of the trial, has no such experience in the White House's current legal adviser, the lawyer who has experienced the seizure investigation at the White House.
One person was surprising about the White House's strategy of coordinating or building war rooms overall, but acknowledging that a coordinated, collective response was needed and one who could carry forward the political struggle.

The plan, which has invested more than 1 billion in 10 ships over the past four years, has every aspect of the guest experience and provides a variety of chilly adventures and food and dinner experiences with nowhere.
Davine News blames Democrats for asking 'Trampine Nirvana films'
It is obvious that Parliamentarian Davine News (R-Calif) was unable to 'investigate' an inquiry into President Donald Trump.
On Thursday, he accused the Democrats of attempting to get the chancellor's naked pictures to protect him.
News, the chairman of the parliamentary intelligence board, made the charge in an initial statement on the charge that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son had secretly sought Ukraine's help to investigate.
Predicting that the Democrats wanted to see the naked pictures of the chancellor, the American parliamentarian said that Ukraine was a 'fake look' created by the leftists and their 'mistake'.
'The Democrats in this group had negotiated with those who thought they were from Ukraine to get dramatical pictures,' News said.
People can justify why they are determined to oust the chancellor in one more year.
After News concluded his speech, senior Haffpost political reporter Jennifer Pentry decided to find out whether Democratic politicians want to know deeply about the matter.
Till now, Connecticut representative Jim Haims (D) has only responded, but we are doubtful that many of his colleagues will believe that his word is true.
Mediate.com is doubtful that News comments on dress refers to the extraordinary and unsubstantiated extra details found in disputed steel documents.
It is a compilation of accusations made by former British spy Christopher Steel, who claims that there is a possibility of a 'small water country' in a hotel room in Moscow that sex workers see 'small water'.
The explanation from the student Udhid Suryah, who has been arrested for fraud in the NEET examination, has changed the explanation given by Honey Medical College Chief Minister Rajendran to the CBCIT police.
Dr. Venkatesan from Tandiar Petta in Chennai.
He is a doctor at Stanley Hospital in Chennai.
There was a complaint that his son Udhid Surya had done a fraud in the NEET examination.
In the subsequent investigation, the CBCIT police arrested student Udhid Surya and his father Dr. Venkatesan.
In the hearing, Udhi's father Venkatesan paid Rs 20 lakhs and selected another student and cheated his son at the medical college.
Udhid Surya and his father were arrested in court and imprisoned.
In such a scenario, CBCIT police conducted an inquiry before the Chief Minister of Honey Govt. Medical College Rajendran (Before inquiring about Udhid Surya).
There is a disagreement between his explanation and Udhid Surya's statement to the CPIT police.
In a detailed explanation, the Chief Minister of Honey Medical College, Shri Rajendran said that during his student gathering, a person from Haldiquet participated.
It is reported that the student enrollment was conducted on the basis of that.
The Chief Minister said that NEET has participated in a collusion and student enrollment and Udhid Surya has participated only in the college grade.
But Udit Surya said he himself was directly involved in adulteration and student admission in the vote.
How did Udhith Surya get admitted to the college with a holticket dressed in the photo of a man who did the rogue
Why did the mixture and student enrollment fail to pay attention
uestions are raised.
It has now been revealed in the inquiry that student Udhid Surya has given her photo-listed Self-Reservation at the Medical College during her student admission.
The film and the film in the hall ticket are different.
Besides, the statement made by the student Udit Surya and the statement made by the Honey Government Medical College Chief Minister Rajendran to the CPIT officials is different.
The CBCIT police have therefore started investigations with the top officials.
If the results come to light, the minds will be left out.
I know who's in touch with.
In a case of cooperative bank misbehavior, Sarath Pawar said that he will be present before the Implementation Department tomorrow and said that he will not be subordinated to the Central Government.
The Government Treasury has suffered a loss of Rs.25,000 crore due to misbehavior in the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank in 2007.
The loss is reported to have resulted in breach of the norm and lending to sugar mills and artisans.
Last month, under the Bombay High Court's order on these abuses, Mumbai police had prosecuted senior Congress leader and former deputy chief minister Ajith Pawar and 70 others.
This included political leaders, former executives and officials of the cooperative bank.
In this case, the enforcement agencies have filed a case against Ajith Pawar and Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Pawar on the basis of the case registered by the police.
Sarath Pawar was the former Chief Minister of Marathi and in the middle of the Congress-led government.
The operation of the Implementation Department has stirred up the election scenario for the Marathi legislative assembly next month (October 21).
In such a scenario, Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Pawar told reporters in Mumbai.
I am grateful to the Department of Implementation for joining this case even when I am not a member of the concerned Cooperative Bank or any place where I can decide.
I'm not surprised at this.
I will mostly be outside Mumbai for the legislative election campaign.
Therefore, I should not misunderstand the implementation department that I am a puzzle.
I'm going to the Implementation Office on Friday.
I will also provide them with the information they want.
Their right to investigate the case.
I believe in the Constitution.
So I will give full support to the inquiry.
Marathi follows the theory of Chatrapati Sivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to bow before the Delhi order.
Marathi chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the accusation that there is a political intervention in the matter.
In this context, he said:
The IGORT had ordered the police to file a case in this regard, and when the fraud is over Rs 100 crore, the Department of Implementation will investigate the case.
This case has been taken up by the Department of Implementation.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Renewable potential biofuel research can help reduce smoke emissions
In the recent years, electric cars and desla Semi-Trucks have been published as headlines, renewable energy seems to have been flying unlike limits: planes
However, a professor at Alberta University has developed a technology that facilitates the use of renewable bio-fuels as an aviation fuel.
Dr. David Fresler, director of the Department of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences at Alberta University, started the project in 2003.
His laboratory is building hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as food oil, animal fluids and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, the technology will be able to use low quality oil in its production, leading to a reduction in carbon emissions of about 85 percent of carbon emissions rather than the release of petrol-based fuels and utilisation of waste from other factories.
The technology is working to replace hydrocarbons in petroleum based fuels.
"Our technology is the first generation of hydrocarbons in diesel cassolin," said Bresler.
As it provides a new light for the use of biofuels, biofuel technologies developed earlier lose stability in less temperatures, which creates a serious problem for high-altitude flying aircraft.
"The problem in aviation is like an unprecedented Gate-22 problem," Fresler said.
In fact, its value is less than the diesel, but more than its requirement.
Fressler's laboratory is now focusing on two choices to produce biofuels for the aircraft.
In the first instance, their hydrocarbon biofuels are another refinement and a less risky approach to inhaling hydrogen.
The second choice is to stabilise fuel even in low temperatures and continue to work on the already partially developed volcano.
On the second election, Fresler said, "We will be able to play a few sports with the vision of our reactor in a small way.
There's a lot of risk.
Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working to commercially manufacture it, as airlines and Canada and the US military are making more investments for renewable choices.
He said that in the future, someone expects to impose a carbon tax on them.
They are expecting an alternative.
Forge is currently operating a testing plant near Edmandan's Waste Management Center and recently received US4 million investment from Lakheed Martin to help build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Chompra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuel every year.
While the carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by 85 percent, Fresler also points out that the reasons for the lack of carbon emissions are the same as fuel transportation and production.
As a technician,
Bresler said that it is also possible to create choices and create a variety of opportunities to take informed decisions.
The High Court yesterday decided to review the basic right petition filed by Sehu Shihabdin Mohammad Shahi, a doctor for maternal and genital disease at the Kurunagal Podhana Hospital.
The petition is scheduled to be taken by the High Court on January 24.
It is notable that Dr. Shabi has filed a fundamental human rights petition, challenging the illegal uterine surgery, arrest and detention by the Criminal Investigation Unit under various charges, including irregular financial gathering.
In the midst of the prime minister's request for peace, the prime minister is calling for peace following Boris Johnson's allies warning that Britain could confront an uprising like Los Angeles if Frexit was withdrawn.
A senior cabinet minister said last night that the second referendum of genuine decision would threaten the country with a grave, populist insurgency.
The prime minister's senior coalition parties warned of the turmeric strikes in France over economic inequality and the unrest at home at home at the level of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Shri Janson stressed on the need to reduce anger in political language, but I will not stop the use of the word "suppression".
Though he appealed for peace, a cabinet minister told the Times: 'We have not seen in this country such as the Kleitz Johns [in 1992] struggle or the Los Angeles riots [in 1992].
People don't think this is possible in this country because it didn't happen before.
Now they have a model of yellow shirt fighting and modern telephones to coordinate it, and only two popular leaders need to motivate the masses.
A riot broke out in Los Angeles in 1992 following the court's release of four white police officers in the case of black auto driver Rodney King.
In the beginning of this year, the well-known yellow shirts - the French revolutionaries against the Glet Johns-worn state - have caused devastation and destruction in the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
Mr. Johnson warned at the bottom that if Britain failed to quit the EU, 'the loss of confidence in our political system would lead to greater loss.'
If 66 percent of us say that 30 million people might have joined the poll, ten million people are still unsatisfactory, the Minister said.
Though 99 percent of them are neglected, more than 100,000 are really angry, writing to their parliamentarians and blocking them.
There is no need for much, and soon thousands of people will be on the streets.
A senior cabinet minister further said that if the decision of the first referendum is changed to the second referendum, there is a danger of a strong and peoples insurgency in the country.
Mr. Johnson has called for a general election to resolve the Brexit issue.
He is reportedly confronting the minister's rebellion to slash his Frexit demands and replace it with a compromise agreement with the European Union.
Life sentence for his brother who murdered Pakistan's social media prominence
Women's rights experts say that justice is often not enforced with contempt, while the procedures are interpreted sometimes, the accused killers have been released on bail and are subject to crumbling cases.
Farzan Bari, a woman rights fighter and founder of Pakistan's first gender analysis at a university, said, "People forget for a long time.
While claiming that it is difficult to establish credible data, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has faced at least 300 cases of homicide in 2018.
Many attorneys say that the actual numbers will be higher as the glory-based Violence Awareness Network estimates that one fifth of the world's 5,000 honour killings take place in Pakistan every year.
Sustainable Monsoon has caused floods and confusion in many parts of India
India's monsoon period has risen almost a month, due to unprecedented rains, collapsed buildings have caused deaths and many crops have started to decay.
Normally, at the beginning of September, the rainfall in northern India will start declining, but this month the average rainfall is 37 higher than usual.
In the remaining few days, the Indian Meteorological Department has said that unlikely weather conditions in the last few decades, this will be the case.
The unprecedented rainfall in many parts of the country is still devastating, and the recent rains are India's western city of Pune, where the uninterrupted rains on Wednesday and Thursday have caused many deaths and devastation due to the collapse of buildings.
The houses were flooded, the streets were knee-watered, and usually such scenes were seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Rainfall also took place in Kolkata, Lucknow and other cities like Hyderabad.
Continuous rains have caused severe damage to the houses in Uttarakhand in the north.
This monsoon started in a time bound manner.
There was water scarcity in many places, and the peasants were ready to wait for drought.
Farmers don't want the monsoon to continue.
It is not likely to rain so much during this year.
Prakash Mehra, a small farmer from Bihar in Uttarakhand, said, "This is my vegetables - cauliflower, beans, peas and tomatoes.
Monsoon from late to late has resulted in rising prices for consumers and the prices of onions that are essential in Indian food have increased.
Normally, for a kilometer of 20 rupees (23 pounds) and in cities like onion, Delhi and Mumbai, 80 rupees (about one) are sold.
Festivals are also at risk.
The next big festival, Dasara, will be on October 8, when the Hindus will set up the tyranny of Ravanan, the role of Ramayana, who laughs brutally with great moustaches.
Burning nightmares a reflection of the victory over evil.
But if these traitors are complied with paper, if the monsoon continues, it will eventually win the night.
What would be the situation if a government hospital, such as a bus stop, free vehicle stop, public accommodation and a public meeting of political parties, could be used for a variety of facilities
That's the state hospital in Uthangarai district of Thiruvananthapuram.
This is an important government hospital where 1000 to 1200 patients are treated daily.
There should not be much noise in hospital surroundings, nor should there be rules to follow in hospitals where there is no filth.
The government hospital in Uthangarai is suffering from tragic misery when the surroundings do not follow anything.
Government and private buses have been halted before the hospital entrance.
Even if the bus stop is near the hospital, the entrance is already stationed.
The shouting of these crystals becomes obsolete.
The bus driver's call for the deficit was loud.
Private ambulances have also been sheltered at the entrance of the government hospital.
This has resulted in a hurricane strike at any time before the hospital.
Revenue and Disaster Management Minister R. P.
Shri R. P. Udayakumar, who was present on the occasion, informed the press.
Southwest monsoon is being confronted in other states except in Tamil Nadu.
The Northeast monsoon extends to Tamil Nadu for three months beginning October.
During the rainy season, there is a possibility of crossing the coast of the sea if there is a decreasing low depression.
Tamil Nadu is ready to face the north-eastern monsoon in the fifteenth year, considering the impact of cyclones in the past.
4,393 locations have been identified as risky.
Out of this, up to 5 feet of water dripping areas have been brought on the most dangerous list.
There is a possibility of cyclone damage in 12 coastal districts of the state.
In these districts, 121 Special Centres have been set up to protect the population.
In addition, it has been advised to keep wedding halls, schools and societies ready in other districts.
148 crore has been earmarked for rescue operations.
Moreover, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) is on standby in these districts.
Not a single fisherman died during the Gaja storm due to the precautionary measures taken by the Tamil Nadu government.
On the contrary, the wall collapsed and electric losses occurred.
Adequate precautionary measures have been taken to prevent such deaths this year.
Rehabilitation and restructuring works continue to provide relief and relief to rescue operations.
Action has also been taken to provide houses to 1. 10 lakh people who have lost their homes in the districts of Khaja cyclone affected by cyclonic storms, Turkey, Turkey, Turkey and Turkey.
This was stated by Minister Udayakumar.
In Siddhini, the temple of Murugan is filled with a few days of heavy rains.
There is a Saravana Library Tuberculosis in the mountainous stairs leading to the Tirthani Mukteshwar Mountain Temple.
On this occasion, the devotees will take a sacred bath, walk through the mountains and reach the corner.
Apart from this, there is a three-day excitement at the audio festival every year.
As there was no water in Thirukulam during the audio release last month, the temple administration, volunteers and devotees were brought to the water through a tractor.
Thereafter, the Tepath festival took place.
In such a scenario, due to the heavy rains that have taken place in the city of Siddhi, the entire Saravanapoyag lake is flooded with water and now the surplus water is leaving.
Four years later, now it is full of Trikulam.
The district collector Bha Ponnaiya has said that the farmers can make a lot of profits by selecting the fastest growing Telepia fish.
Speaking on the occasion, he said:
Fishermen who are fishing in farm kitchens can select genetically upgraded Dhilapia fish so that they can grow faster than other fishes.
In comparison to other fish, the fishes of Dhilapia can be grown by a large number of loads in lesser area.
These are immune powers that can grow faster than other fish.
This type of fish is more likely to be consumer.
Therefore, farmers are requested to select and grow genetically enhanced fish in their farm herbs.
The government is ready to sell fish farms throughout the year near Thilapiya Fisheries Dam.
These can be benefitted by farmers buying and growing.
Farmers who grow these fish should be able to maintain a safety fence around their fish farms so that they cannot spread to the nearby waters.
Fisheries should be registered at the Fisheries Development Camp in Kancheepuram district and thereafter should be fisheries in their farms.
Further details can be accessed by the Directorate of Fisheries, Department of Fisheries, on the eastern coastal road, either directly at Kanchipuram district or telephone 044-24492719.
A three-way MoU has been signed to conduct DNA testing of human bones available underground.
Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, Madurai Kamaraj University and Harvard Medical School have jointly signed a three-pronged Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for conducting DNA tests of ancient human bones extracted from underground, thorny and archaeological surfaces.
Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Archaeology, D. Udayachandran said: -
The MoU will be signed in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamaraj College and the David Research Laboratory of Harvard School.
We believe that in our future innovations, we will find older human bones in turmoil, underwater and underwater turmoil.
These models will be sent to the DNA study.
This is mainly an indication of what kind of gene was there in the human bones excavated in Tamil Nadu.
Increased incidence of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and paralysis.
A new study points out that working with large quantities of pesticides could be the reason behind heart diseases later.
That was the case with a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, which has been pursued for more than three decades.
Researchers found that in comparison to individuals who did not work with pesticides, a large number of individuals had a 45 percent high risk of heart disease or paralysis.
The Survey stresses the importance of using individual security appliances while being industrially pesticides and the importance of documenting and controlling the usual cardiovascular hazards of pesticides due to service, said Dr. Beatrice Rodricks, Vice-Chairman.
He is an old medical officer at Hawaii University in Manoa.
These discoveries emerge from the data received from over 6000 persons from Ohu who participated in the Guagini Honelu Heart Exhibition.
The analysts said that these innovations do not apply to women and others as only men from Japanese family participated.
Since the pesticides have long semi-weapons, their impact on health can be felt after several years of their existence.
In the event, the maximum damage was reported within 10 years.
"After 34 years of pursuit of these people, there was no link between heart disease and paralysis in the work," said Rodricks in a press release.
As other age-related factors gain significance, there is a possibility of a possible link between insecticides and heart diseases in the past.
Researchers discovered that there was no significant connection between low to moderate insecticides and heart disease or paralysis.
Jelansky-Trump telephone call: Frozengo's comment
This week Washington was politically furious after US President Donald Trouble began his anti-incumbency operations.
Less than political experience, Voldimir Selensky would have wanted to avoid being dragged into a political fraud.
But what do we know about the Selensky-Trump links that have long-term implications on Selensky
At the beginning of the telephone call, Trump told Selensky that the US is doing more to Ukraine than any other European country.
While the White House's telephone call has no word, the German president and other European leaders have said they are simply talking about definite plans - indicating that German leader Angela Merkel is trampling.
Selensky's response to the 1000 percent acceptance is considered to be problematic, not 100 percent.
Selensky added that French President Mcron and Merkel were not sufficiently able to help Ukraine.
The conversation has placed politicians, particularly the opposition parties within Ukraine, on the social media.
Ukraine's former president, Petro Porrochenko, commented on the Twitter that the EU's assistance was 'not yet'.
Frozengo said he was thankful to the EU's assistance, including sanctions and economic aid, during the 'Russian aggression' in Borosenco and other tents.
Ukraine politician Victoria Vassiska said, 'How can we talk to Germany and France again' Others expressed concern.
Trump, who is obscurely referring to military aid, not only about Joe Biden's son Hunter, but also about the hacked DNC Charter, but also asks Selensky to investigate two things, which indicates Ukraine's intervention in hacking Republican emails during the 2016 election.
It doesn't see if the relationship with Europe would interrupt or break with French and German chancellors.
I don't want to say anything wrong...
We are grateful to all of us for helping us in the UN General Assembly in New York, following the telephone call.
Selenski is scheduled to meet Russia, Germany and French leaders at a four-day meeting in Narmandi in October.
A quiet black hole suddenly shines and shines around the stars.
If such a black hole turns into a shining atom, it is called 'Guwasar'.
Scientists have seen the illumination of six such cave men in the far-flung areas of Palomar in America.
This has been happening for thousands of years, even after six months, has surprised scientists.
To grow a lot of trees, they're releasing the oxygen inside the wind carbon di-oxide.
However, the 'Ioce' device that produces 'Hypergent Industries' incorporates multiple carbon dioxide to the 1 acre tree-in-house carbon dioxide.
It's a fascination that grows into the ios bio reactors, like the cool breeze box, that introduces carbon-ty-oxide.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the nation through the Maan Ki Baat programme.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on the occasion of other festivals including Navaratri, exhorted 150th Gandhi Jayanti to make the country useful once and free from plastic.
Modi said: Tobacco affects the growth of the brain and harms the health, so we must try to avoid it.
Since there are harmful chemicals in e-cigarettes, a ban has been imposed recently.
People are not very aware about this.
Youngsters should stay away from e-cigarettes.
There is a misconception that there is no danger from e-cigarettes.
The heating of nicotine liquids in e-cigarettes produces a type of chemical smoke, unlike ordinary cigarettes, which can harm the health.

In the new era, aviation, safety and sustainability must continue to be our key basic priorities, he added.
Shri Atta said that for his part, the awards will fulfil the hard work and relentless efforts of this sector, and this is a great achievement for the efforts of this country.
The aviation sector has the greatest potential to improve the economy of the country, he added.
There may be socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from concentration and security, we can achieve it.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, held a meeting with members of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) in New York yesterday.
During the meeting, Modi announced financial assistance of US 14 million for the Caribbean community and public market social development programmes and US 150 million for projects related to Solar, Renewable Energy and Climate Change.
Prime Minister Modi also announced setting up of Regional Centre for Excellence in Information Technology and Regional Industry Training Centre at Georgetown, Gaya.
Gericham is a growing federation of 20 countries in the Caribbean i.e. in the western islands.
They collaborate to create an economic and political society, to formulate policies for the region and promote economic growth and trade.
Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister Modi said, "I welcome your interest in attending this meeting.
India is fighting against some of the major issues of climate change and poverty today.
Todays meeting, with mutual cooperation, India is integrating with the Kyrgyz Republic to meet our present needs and future aspirations.
Today, I am confident that each one of us will make important recommendations from our side.
The Caribbean Islands are in the US territory.
Some of these islands are surrounded by the Caribbean sea.
Some islands are surrounded by the Caribbean Sea on one side and the North Atlantic Ocean on the other.
The islands are located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, east of Central America and north of South America.
This includes about 700 islands.
This is the island, which is nearest to the US, but is economically backward.
A substantial number of people of Indian origin live in these islands.
That is why India has provided this financial assistance to the Caribbean countries.
FEMA nominates Drump Peter Keyner for the post: White House
In the US, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responsible executive, Peter Cainer Punchur, is accompanied by a testimony to the Senate Financial Internal Security Sub-Committee inquiry into the FEMA's 2020 budget demand on April 3, 2019 at Capital Hill in Washington.
The White House reported Thursday that US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Keyner, chairman of the Washington (Reuters) - Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
The FEMA deputy executive, Keyner, is responsible for the agency, which oversees the government's actions for cyclones and wild fires.
Since Brack Lang resigned from office in March, the organisation has been without a Senate-recognised executive.
Lang resigned following the decision of the Homeland Security Department responsible for the FEMA that Lang had abused government vehicles going to Washington and his home in North Carolina.
In the beginning of this month, Jeffrey Pyard, another nominee for the job, withdrew from the contest after the accusation that he had been involved in a fight in Paris during his background test.
The appointment of a genius for the post was expected.
He should start working, his nomination should be recognized by the majority Senate.
Prior to becoming FEMA Deputy Administrator in 2018, the White House said that Keyner Rod had worked in emergency management on the island and was a naval soldier.
The Union Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that he has not been able to interact with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka many times on the issue of Cauvery.
The 34th convocation of VID University was held in Katbadi, Vellore district yesterday.
Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari was the Chief Guest.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gadkari said that in Thiruvananthapuram, Wind and Solar Power Generation Programme will also be implemented.
From the ports of Thiruvananthapuram, Kandla and Paradip, we are considering implementing a low-cost wind power project.
Once the project is implemented, one unit of electricity can be manufactured at a cost of 2.50 rupees.
We have been working on a project worth Rs. 6000 crores to prevent wastage of 3000 TMC of water from Godavari in Andhra Pradesh.
However, Tamilnadu and Karnataka have spoken several times to implement water conservation schemes but they have not been benefited.
There will be no water problem between Tamilnadu and Karnadaka if there is a ban on mixing Cauvery water in the sea.
Negotiations have so far made no progress on the Cauvery issue.
This was stated by Shri Gadkari.
Shri Gadkari also participated in the foundation stone laying ceremony for the rope groups being set up in 13 States on behalf of the Board of Cars.
When Katkari left, the BJP shouted 'Bharat Mata Ki Jay' as usual.
The supporters of Vellore DMK MB and Kadir Anand, who came there, shouted that Periyar would live.
Having noticed this, Kadkari moved away from there with fervor.
Police shut down illegally operating Marijuwana Baping in San Caprical Valley: CPS Los Angeles
L. Mande (CPSLA) - Police shut down an illegal Marijuwana neighbourhood in San Capriel Valley on Thursday
The police raided the weekend on suspicion that illegal Marriage Web Pena was sold, at around 4.37 in the afternoon, at an office building in Delstore Avenue's 9600 Black - discovered the oil-enriched ganja oil in the largest jackets.
The LT Christopher Geno in El Mande police said that an instrument used by the web guards was detected.
Cano said this is a very dangerous procedure.
Cano, who worked in the narcotics sector, said that there is a possibility of fire harvesting in the oil harvesting process to use poppy products.
The Prime Minister said that as it is enriched, the extraordinary situation in our garments is electric that can cause fireworks to cause an explosion.
If there are many jackets and similar materials, there is no ordinary fire crashing one after another, and this layer is likely to completely break into the explosion.
A Hasmad group was called to the empty office to seize that thing that was illegal and dangerous.
The value of the seizure material and equipment is not immediately known.
Speculators have said that they have found illegal activity when they have been searched through anonymous information.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind the illegal nepping operation.
They said they believed that because the place was empty, the person could have constructed the office there.
As the trial continued, they wanted to ensure that the illegal nepotism was not available to all, particularly the recent information about nepotism.
They don't even know if they really have what they want, Keno said.
It can be mixed with other evil vinegars.
This is very bad for our society and children, so we always warn you to stay away from these activities.
First Elizabeth's missing dress will be screened at Hampton Court palace
It was done by the finest chamblet bowl, strawed with silver slabs, and embroidered in a miraculous tank full of plants, animals and barley.
Eleri Lynnn, who is responsible for dressing in historical royal palaces, says only one.
Having been placed 100 years ago on the wall of a small rural Parish church, he saw that the sluggish cloth could only be a dress away from the first Elizabeth cloth adolescent.
Three years after the coincidence of the luxurious dress used in the church in Hierfordshire, in Bakton, the same rooms that the queen could wear, 450 years later, will be shown next month at the Hampton tribunal compound.
The dress of the 16th century is still one in the entire state dress.
Three years of research strengthens the opinion of experts that the garment must have been part of the royal family cloth, despite the lack of sword testimony that this garment was once worn by the queen of Elizabeth.
The price of wind-made cloth is highly dressed, legally allotted to the supreme members of the royal family, and high quality of embroiderized plants and flowers, excessive deer and dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear reflect the predecessor's highest status.
When it was formed, the tutor might have the same value as Mansion.
Moreover, in the 1950s, in the latter part of the Elizabeth regime, as other women in the state competed with him, his opponents would not accept such a fine dress.
That's a big deal, so many of the commentators came and took a look at it.
When they looked at it, they were surprised to see 'Vaw' and when they left, it was always satisfactory to see that there was only one of the clothes of the royal family.
With the second long life in the garments, it cannot be regarded as unexpectedly slaughtered to keep the altar of the dark Saint Faith Church in Beckton.
Beckton is the village of Blanch Beri, who has served him for a long life in the queen of Elizabeth, who is very close to her and has long linked the textiles sector with Beri.
Although Elizabeth had joined the post-death period in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth might have given it to the Barry family or the Parish Church before he died in 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of preservation, more than 400 hours of them will be exhibited, with exclusively moulded silk and pure juice injections, the altar cloth, which is to be displayed in the contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, the most famous Rainbo Fortrait, in which he has worn a count, which has been distributed in Hotfield House loans during the exhibition.
Liby Thomson, who presided over the defence, said, "When you work with historical dresses, there is real respect for those who created them, most of its security took place in the Hampton jurisdiction in the transformed cattle sheds in the Hampton jurisdiction - it is only a big place to keep some of the precious screens of the monarchy.
Looking at the earlier and backward embryo, I had great respect for those who created it.
I have never worked in such a wealthy dress.
Elizabeth's disgusting dress is being shown in the Hampton court hall on October 12.
Udhid Surya, a student of Honey Medical College, was illuminated in the NEET examination.
He was subsequently arrested by the CPIT police with his family.
The identification work of students has been intensified in all medical colleges.
That is why there is a distinction between the old photographs and images of student Jyotika and student Siva Ramachandran in Govi PSG Medical College.
This was followed by an inquiry by the medical college department.
Narayan Babu, Director, Medical College, Chennai, told the press today:
On 23rd, we had a complaint that the photographs of both the students were a little bit interesting.
Thereafter, we set up a five-member inquiry committee.
We conducted trials with two students and their parents.
We have compared our documents with their certificates, NEET Selection Hall tickets and identity cards.
At the end of this survey, the two students are certainly not falsified.
Even though there is a slight difference in photographs, this kind of problem arises.
The Health Minister has therefore ordered that the biometric process be brought into the student enrollment from next year.
Biometric and cargo registration will now be implemented in the coming days.
Details of the students involved are only after registration of trading in the period of application, examination and student enrollment.
So no one can cheat on it.
Subsequently, the students of the inquiry - Siva Ramachandran and Jyotika - spoke to the press.
Jyotika said, I was in the shape of a double cloth in my photo.
It was taken in school.
Now I've changed my hair.
So, now it's not like that.
They have also called me a surveillance.
Only after cutting the hair has become a problem, there is nothing else.
Ramachandran said that there is a difference between the image and the old picture.
I had only one photo at that time.
It's an old photo.
So there was confusion and inquiry.
The Pondicherry Plastics Association has called upon Prime Minister Modi to save lakhs of workers.
Sankaran and Secretary V. K.
Plastic wastes are collected and recycled in the streets of India by throwing dust on the streets.
Currently, all the blocked plastic items in some states across India are recyclable.
Due to poverty and unemployment, plastic waste is already being recycled from 60 to 70 in India.
The remaining wastes can also be used in a useful manner.
1. Plastic liquid road 2. Electricity manufacturing 3. Petrol, diesel manufacturing 4. Concrete stones can be used using plastic waste in different ways.
In the name of civilisation, the garry bags, which are once considered important in extracting materials, are freely levied in the name of civilisation to back up the goods when the public buys the goods.
Plastic carriage bags are being distributed in all the reservoirs.
Due to the density of carriage bags, all the waste in the reservoirs leaves the waste away from plastic.
Unfortunately, plastic floats only.
There are 40,000 plastic product manufacturing units across India.
98 of these are small and micro-organized.
There are tens of thousands of shops that buy and sell plastic products.
There are 2,000 companies exporting plastic products.
Nearly 50 lakh people are employed in both production and sales.
5 lakh crore has been sold and 50 thousand crore has been disbursed to the Central and State Governments.
As far as the plastic industry is concerned, there is no environmental problem in its manufacturing or using its products.
Unfortunately, however, the environmental problem arises because the public lacks adequate awareness about environmental health.
Therefore, on October 2, we urge the Prime Minister to issue announcements to ensure that there are thousands of young and small entrepreneurs who are dependent on the industry, and those who are dependent on them, save their livelihood, by putting strict restrictions on plastic waste in a constructive manner.
Thus, they said in the report.
Indian Haj Association President Abu Bakar, who was present at the All India Haj Auditorium convention in Mumbai said that efforts will be made to integrate India with Umrah Visa at the airport immediately after landing in Saudi Arabia.
He expressed pride in the fact that Tamil Nadu is the only state where Haj pilgrimage in India will provide subsidies to the people.
All India level seminar on behalf of Haj was held at Haj House, Mumbai.
Dr. Asoub, Ambassador of India to Saudi Arabia, President Abu Bakar, President of Haj Association of India were also present on the occasion.
He was accompanied by Heads of Haj, Executive Officers, Foreign Affairs and Minority Welfare Departments.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Abu Bakar said that the Government of Tamil Nadu has been providing subsidies for Haj over the last two years due to the love and affection of Islamists.
He said that Tamil Nadu alone is the only government that provides such a subsidy in India.
Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador of India to Saudi Arabia, Ashuf said that an effort will be made to visit 30 lakh Haji Haj by 2025.
Hajimars who visited Hajji in 2019 were known to have had deficiencies in Air India.
Therefore, a new agreement will be signed with Air India to facilitate affordable Haj 2020.
He further said that with the help of OIO, a Saudi-based Indian company, Hajimars will also be provided accommodation with Nutrition Hostel facilities.
During the review meeting, discussions were also held on measures to be taken for the visit of a large number of Islamists.
President Abu Bakar conveyed his gratitude to the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Minority Affairs for Haj 2019, on behalf of 30 crore Islamists living in India and on behalf of Haj Association of India.
A car was stored in a gathering to suspect the farm land in SN Pallaya this morning, the next gold from Katbadi in Vellore district.
There's no one on the side.
The glass behind the car was broken.
Inside the car, there were weapons of mass destruction and slaughter.
The villagers informed the police about this.
The police rushed to the scene and rescued the Sikh car.
One-third of the US drug trafficking chief
CPS News saw a meeting in the morning for drugs in the west of Chicago shortly after sunrise.
Brian McNide, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), showed the daylight.
Last year, nearly 800 people died in Chicago due to excessive drug addiction.
Mexico said that 90 of the narcotic drugs in Chicago are from Mexico.
DEA focuses on summarised nemasio servates, called LMS.
Matthew Donhak, DEA chief agent in Mexico, said, "He is the first open priority for DEA and provincial law enforcement in America."
The prize for L Menchosov is up to 10 million.
He helped in finding dozens of L Mancheso drug laboratories in the jungle.
Elmancho's hijacker, Jellisco Nyeva Generasian or Sygencie, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs entering the US via sea and land.
According to the Justice Department, the kidnapper has kidnapped Gokein, Methambedaman and Herain, who was slaughtered in the Penton.
El Menchoso's head has been awarded 10 million.
When he lived in California 30 years ago, he was arrested on charges of drug addiction and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he started a brutal hijacking.
He has a large number of weapons, Arabics and 50 Caliber weapons.
On the basis of his own self-respecting groups, he said.
Since the shooting of Mexico's military helicopter, the killing of six people, and the execution of many in the early summer, El Mencho has defended his empire unpunished.
Thousands of people have died in recent years due to the violence of hijackers.
According to Mexico government figures, about 94 murders occur every day.
The Mexico drugs captured in Chicago are very toxic and cannot be handled without security cover.
In the laboratory, the hijackers are stamped on the cocaine balls.
More than one-third of them can be seen as the signature of L Menchoso.
"He is the reason for sending a real killer to innocent women and children," says Donhak.
Therefore, Donhak said that if someone dies, the medicines are very likely to come out of the system of LMSO.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year due to excessive drug addiction.
The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Jitendra Singh has said that those who do not take pride in calling Prime Minister Modi the Father of India should not call themselves Indians.
Everyone knows that BJP leaders continue to misrepresent Gandhi and Nehru.
A few hours before the Hughdy Modi incident in Houston, USA, Union Minister Amitsha said Pakistan was the cause of the occupation of Kashmir.
A few days back, many BJP leaders including Pragya Tagore have praised Gandhi and praised Kotsey.
In the 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston, Prime Minister Modi said that US President Trump is backed by President Trump.
Instead, US President Trump praised Modi.
In his address, he said that there were strong divisions in Hindi, and as the father of this country, he had united by removing the divisions.
It usually surprised many when Gandhiji was the father of India.
Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, 'Howdy Modi, who participated in the event, has used it to campaign for the trumpet.
This is a very wrong act.
It is also wrong to retaliate with Gandhiji as a father of India.'
Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh said, "American President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the father of India.
Some have expressed their opposition.
Thus, those who do not take pride in calling Prime Minister Modi the Father of India should not call themselves Indians.'
The relevance of Pandong principles is due to global multilateral mechanisms being adjusted.
Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Secretary Aryasingh pointed out at a meeting of ministers of the Non-Alignment Movement in New York that the relevance of the Ponduch principles has been limited to global multilateral mechanisms.
Speech by Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Secretary Arya Singh:
Foreign Secretary Ariasinghe underscored the relevance of the Pundang principles as global multilateral mechanisms are being tackled
Speaking on the sidelines of the 74th UN General Assembly meeting at the level of Ministers of the Non-Alignment Movement held in New York on September 26, 2019, Foreign Secretary Ravinath Aryasingh underlined the relevance of the Pundang principles while global multilateral mechanisms are in a dilemma.
Its moral obligation is to give voice to the carriages of the southern world, particularly of the developing smaller countries, as the Non-aligned Movement consists of 55 percent of the world's population.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement to address the current global challenges over national boundaries such as conflicts, displacement, climate change and infectious diseases.
Unconventional security threats such as climate change have emerged not only as an economic and social challenge, but also as a security threat to the social and nations that have been affected by the humanitarian disasters.
While welcoming the UN General Secretary's Climate Action Summit held at the United Nations Headquarters on September 23, 2019, Secretary Arya Singh expressed deep concern over the negative impact of climate change in island countries like Sri Lanka.
The Secretary of State hoped that the COP25 agreement to be held in Chile would enhance efforts to counter climate change by fulfilling the duties specified in the Paris Agreement.
External Affairs Secretary Aryasinghe said that Sri Lanka has a special significance in opposing all forms of racism, hatred and violent extremism and there is a need to focus on new threats demonstrated by the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka.
Such a global threat threat threatens the security of all nations, not only by one country, but by joint efforts, but by calling for an unilateral movement to contribute positively and collaboratively to this global security threat.
Sri Lanka relies on an independent society, which has ensured freedom of opinion, but has to be cautious about the threat of misuse of hate speech, Internet and social media bases.
The principles of sovereignty and political freedom as a means of preserving international peace and security and promoting friendship and cooperation among nations were the theme of the ministerial level meeting and the result was adopted during the meeting.
Sri Lanka is a co-sponsor of the 1955 Bundang Summit and a member of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Over the last six decades, the committee has continued to improve and its membership is now 120 in the United Nations, i.e., two-thirds of its membership.
The permanent embassy of Sri Lanka for the United Nations is New York.
In order to improve the livelihood of the poor in Tamil Nadu, former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced 'Amma Cement' at a very low price.
A balloon of cement is sold for 190 rupees.
To achieve this, Aadhar Card, Family Card, Housing Building and Accredited Building Map or Village Administrative Officers Approval Certificate shall be distributed to the mother Cement Sales Officer in Tamil Nadu Nuclear Material Deposit.
Whatever cement we buy, we have to link the 'DD' to the application.
Cement clothing will be provided within a week after the 'TD' oil is entered on the Internet.
This is the process.
This is not followed systematically in many places.
There are complaints all over Tamilnadu that the wrong officials are taking money and selling their mother's cement balloons in the black market.
The beneficiaries are also trying to get rid of the waves and buy cement bales very quickly.
PS4 goes back to ancient times, wonderful Blastation 4 reports by Sony
Sonny has made her more aware of the upcoming PS4 exclusive game The Last of Ass: Part II.
As part of Sony's current status, Sony announced the February 2020 release date for the Lost of Assessment.
The new sports show released in front of the upcoming Dhakadi game enhanced the audience.
The game shows that more details have been announced in the days following the Great Lost of AS 2 game.
Sony and Nati Tag appear to be going back to the old system in more than one way.
We have not seen much since the PSO era, the Last of Ass: Part is coming in more than two discs.
In an interview with The Telegraph that the series has emerged as one of the biggest sports events ever seen, Nil Truckman of the NATI Aayog confirmed it.
The story will be very interesting and complicated without being part of it, he added.
Such a story has to be said to be so enormous with many roles.
We don't think we should make the biggest sport that we have ever had, it has become.
"We are enthusiastic about providing this story and you will feel that in a few moments when you think that you have reached the end, that is the beginning and that it has been added to another part," said Dragman.
This game is not a blue race, it comes in two disks.
The Last of Ass: Part 2 contains two unsafe easter x (through Campspat).
While we don't want to wonder, the Easter in the game contains references to the old Nati Dock Publications.
You will be able to know more during the publication of The Last of Assessment Part II for PS4 on 21st February, 2020.
PS Blues has won a remastered the Last of Asses and the PS4 holders can be prepared for the series.
Soni recently announced the Free PS4 Games for the Blair Station Plus in October 2019, which includes the above mentioned Nati Dock Publishment.
PS Blus subscribers will receive MLP The Show in October.
Soni has published a number of versions of the game, including the Pumber Edition, which includes Ellie's backback, her brasslet and the idol of the destructive version, if you like to pre-order the continuation of the remaster The Last of Ace.
The Sri Lankan government has welcomed the proposal for a re-approval of Shamladeep in public interest.
In this regard, the media report issued by the Ministry of External Affairs is as follows:
Foreign Secretary Aryasinghe welcomed the proposal for re-approval of Shamladeep in public welfare.
Foreign Secretary Raveenatha Aryasinghe welcomed the proposal for re-approval of the Saddam Deepawa family last Thursday and reiterated Sri Lanka's full support for the use of the rapid path previously used for reconciliation of Kambia to allow the full-scale participation of the Commonwealth Heads of State Conference in Rwanda in 2020.
One of the pages of the 74th UN General Assembly meeting was held in New York on September 26, 2019 under the chairmanship of Minister of State for Public Welfare and United Nations, Wimbledon Prabhu Ahmed.
'Sri Lanka is enjoying strong bilateral relations with Shamdi, one of the closest neighbours and one of the South Asian countries, and it is a pleasant pleasure to see his intention to reunite public welfare, one of the major initiatives taken by the new administration of Shamdi in the past year.'
Specifically, a comprehensive assessment work carried out by the Public Welfare Secretariat in the evening of January, 2019, led to a direct decision and pointed out that any obstacles against its re-entry should be treated as merely disadvantages affecting all nations from time to time.
He insisted that more restrictions leading to less incentives should not be put on their way.
The Foreign Affairs Secretary also attended the Group 77 (G77) Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting held in New York on Friday, September 27, 2019.
It was noted that G77 has been specifically set up to invite global actions to meet the various requirements of countries in special circumstances such as countries, land surrounding developing countries and developing small island countries.
These problems worsen economic and social development and affect their ability to achieve sustainable development goals.
The organisation must act as a joint voice to demand greater international aid and support for the affected and marginalized countries, particularly for financial and skill development.
In a statement issued during the Asian Cooperation Discussion during the Asian Cooperation Discussion of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministers Meeting as co-Prime Minister for Scientific, Technology and Innovation, the Asian Cooperation Discussion Region said that the region is playing a key role in sustainable socio-cultural and economic development in the region.
The central level of Asian collaborative discussions on improving economic competitiveness in the region is helping Asian countries to compete at a level playing field in the world market.

Ronald Lee Haskel: The person who killed his ex-wife's family in Texas was punished.
Ronald Lee Haskel was punished for killing Stephen and Kethi Stay and four of their five children in the spring of 39 and 2014.
On July 9, 2019, he entered Stan's house to find out where his wife, Melanie Haskell, broke down.
He was not there, but his sister Ketin Stay and his family were there.
The Harris County Sheriff office reported that Stephen Stay, 39, Kethi Stay, 33, 13 and 4-year-old two boys, and two girls 9 and 7, were killed by the Haskell gun.
Only one member of that family survived the 15-year-old CASIT status.
Officials said that even after some time he was completely cured, he was seriously injured at that time.
The journals unanimously rejected Thursday's statement that Ronald Lee Haskel had been buried.
The court was postponed until Monday for the sentence.
uantum Website closes truth: Science Daily
The decision of the US Military Research Institute has brought the quantum portal closer to one step.
Such a website will provide the Army with unprecedented security, exploration and time-bound capabilities in the usual network approaches.
The Centre for Distributed Guantam Information from the Military Research Laboratory of the US Army's Resistance Skill Development, which will be funded and managed by the Military Research Office of the laboratory, has seen a record by the Inspect University researchers to utilize the fiber-optic cables to transform the uantum Recession of 50 kms.
The recession is a synthesis that can be generated between cubics such as quantum products.
If the connection between the two Cubids is measured, it will affect the decision to measure one another, although the second Cubid is at a very early stage.
'This is a practical length of two more orders in the morning than [50 kilometres] earlier and the commencement of the inter-city Guantum networks,' his innovations were published in the Nature Journal Guantam Infermation, a researcher at the University of Insprac and a leading analyst for the project.
The inter-city Guantam networks would have been built by the remotest tips of the Portuguese Cubids, although they were kept far and wide.
Researchers have said that this distribution is imperative for the installation of the Guantam Internet.
Sara Cample, co-chairman of the Armed Forces Programme, which supports this research, said.
On the other hand, after travelling through the fiber, the recessional quality also has a higher level to meet the requirements of some of the most difficult uantum Network utilities.
Research teams began testing atomic calcium accumulated in a library.
Using laser cameras, researchers set a quantum leaflet on the library, while provoking an exposure to the gathering of Guantam data.
As a result, the quantum of the atoms and optical vessels were reversed.
It is a challenge to send Fotton through fiber-optic cables.
"The network of 854 nanometers swelled by the Calcium cinema is quickly sucked by the optical fibre," said Lanyan.
So his team first sent the lights through a luminous laser illuminated by a powerful laser.
The broadband of Potan has been favourable for a long distance journey - 1550 nanometers, the current level of communication channel.
After that, the researchers sent the Potan through a 50-km fiber-optic cable.
Their measurements showed that the atomic and optical vessels were still in recession even after the channel change and distance journey.
These decisions provide a direct way to facilitate the use of calcium to facilitate a network of long-distance accessories, as it is possible to collaborate with a high-level Cadre Cupid.
Military researcher Dr. Fredrich Fademi, who is the Vice-Manager of the Programme, said that the Army is very much needed for large scale recession networks, precision, guidance and timely applications.
