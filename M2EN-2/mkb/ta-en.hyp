Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only Indian community participates in it
Now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social movements there also celebrate Deepavali with full fervor and enthusiasm.
In a way, we can say that India is being created there.
Friends, there is an attraction of festival tourism in the world.
There are many possibilities for festival tourism in this .
Whatever our endeavours, whatever festivals like Holi, Deepavali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, we must demonstrate that.
In our country, in every state and in every region, various festivals are organized, in which people from other countries take more country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in the last episode that we will do something different on this Diwali.
On this auspicious occasion, I had said that on this auspicious occasion, we will celebrate the strength and achievements of India's women, that is, we will pay our homage to the people of India.
In a few days, stories in the social media that have inspired many inspiring stories have started accumulating.
Ramesh Ji, a millionaire from the recession, has said that his mother is his power in the App.
In the 1990s, when my father was in his time, my mother accepted the gold that she maintained five children.
Today we have five brothers sitting in good work.
My greetings to your mother, Mr. Ramesh.
Furthermore, Geetika Swami, who is very close to Twitter, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the sage of India.
As far as Kavita Tiwari is concerned, the daughter of India is her daughter and she gives her strength.
Mother is very proud that her daughter makes a beautiful painting.
He also has good marks in the legal entrance examination called CLAT.
People are sharing this kind of information.
You must read and see, inspire and share something in your neighbourhood just like those who are present in it. On this occasion, I extend my greetings to all these great personalities of India.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation for this thing in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, this year on November 12, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is spread not only in India but all over the world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to Guru Nanak Dev Jis vision.
I cannot forget that I went to Venkuar and Gurudwara in Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has many things to share with him, but many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be fully required.
Nanak Dev ji was above all concerned about his service.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji considered selfless service priceless.
He strongly voiced and acted against social evils such as evil.
The message of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji spread across the shores of the world.
He was one of those who traveled in large numbers during his time.
He went to many places, wherever he went, he would win the hearts of all through his simplicity and service.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji undertook several important religious tours, which are called Udaasi.
He carried the message of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, in all directions, to the people of all places, to the sovereign and the sacred.
Even the renowned saint of Assam, Shankardev ji, is believed to have got inspired by him.
He undertook a pilgrimage to the land of Haridwar.
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed in Gurubak Gurudwara, a holy place in Kashi.
He also visited holy places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhist religions.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bihar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had resolved the water conservation situation there.
It reminds all of us that a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Sahab is in Bihar, which was dedicated to him.
During a period Guru Nanak ji had travelled in the north, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
This led to a very strong link between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev went to Tibet, and the people there accepted him as a guru.
He is also bowed to Uzbekistan on his pilgrimage.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited large numbers of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He was in the minds of millions of people, who followed his teachings with full commitment and are following them even today.
Just a few days ago, government ambassadors from around 85 countries went to Amritsar from Delhi.
And they visited the porch there, and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanakdev.
This is the day when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born, he was the son of one who connected the country.
Sardar Patel had the magnificent ability to consolidate the people, while those with disagreements had the ability to accommodate them.
He's actually dedicated to seeing Man of Detail, Nukkip.
Besides, he has expertise in institutional functioning.
He has the art of setting up plans and designing strategies.
When we read about Sardar ji's work, we know how strong his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country came to attend the Congress congress in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All arrangements at the conference were imposed on Sardar.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's drinking water network.
He ensured that no one should have water shortage.
He had contacted the farmers and appealed to them to make khadi pieces.
At the same time, a substantial increase in Khadi sales has also been confirmed.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He was an important figure in determining basic rights, which has left no place for any inequality based on caste and religion.
Friends, As the country's first Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had succeeded in a remarkable effort in unifying the synagogues, in a big and historical coincidence.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we only talk about his contribution to certain areas of integration of the country.
As soon as Sardar Patel received this message, he immediately stepped into an intensive action, not delaying a moment.
When he was ordered and flew immediately, the enemy's evil desire to capture the Lakshadweeps was dumped.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Adihar brothers to ensure that all necessary assistance is provided for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in Indias progress.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to commemorate the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, 2018.
This is the world's largest statue.
This is a two-storey statue at the height of the statue of the independent goddess of America.
Every Indian is proud of the world's tallest statue.
Every Indians head is filled with pride.
I am extremely happy that more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the statue of unity in one year.
And, behold, every day 8500 men have visited the glory of the idol of unity.
It is learnt that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapathikalli garden, Batambula garden, Vanchalla, Child Nutrition Park and Unity Narsari which have improved the economy of the region and new opportunities for employment for the people.
Friends, for all the states and for the tourism sector, this statue of unity can be a study.
Within a year, we are all witnesses of how a place can become a world famous tourist destination.
There are people from our country and people from abroad.
Traffic, logistics, guides and environmentally favourable organisations are developing one after another.
I also urge you to give up your priceless time and visit the statue of unity.
But at the same time, I once again insist that every Indian traveling with his family should visit at least 15 places in India and stay there in the night.
Friends, you must be aware that from 2014 to October 31 we are observing the countrys unity day.
On this day, we convey the message of saving our country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organised like every year.
This will include all sections of the society and all sections of the society.
In this context, this drive is being carried out not only for physical, physical, friendly, but also for India's unity and for India's new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had connected the country with the help of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a friend in our lives, in a diverse country like India, we must keep adding strength to this mantra of unity at every stage, at every turn, at every step and at every step.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very constructive and conscious to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, there will be many examples of those who are engaged in sustainable activity to promote mutual harmony.
But, on the contrary, the effort of the society, its contribution, quickly disappears from the memorial.
Friends, I clearly remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had passed its judgment on the Ramjanmabhoomi issue.
But after the Ramjanmabhoomi verdict came to light, the then state, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions, sages and nobles made a very soft and neutral comment.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure on the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duties.
This is an example of how much unity is the country's strength.
Even Gods who enjoy the fruits are 125 crore Indians.
But there is a comfortable experience and an interesting experience.
I heard why I felt that I should not share with you.
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature is 50-60 degrees below the Earth.
Wind bio-gas is merely a name.
In such a catastrophic situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is no less than a mighty act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders but also conducting a clean Siachen movement.
I convey my best wishes and thanks to the people of our country for this wonderful duties of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to find anything in the severe cold there.
In such a scenario, it is very important to analyze and make arrangements for waste material.
What kind of ecosystem is there here, it is a place of life of rare animals like ice and rare animals like iPex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are not a new era of awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, Deepawali, especially in every family, is very rarely buying something new and bringing something from the market.
I had once said we should try to buy local goods.
If we get the required products from our village then what is the need to go to the regional level
What is the need to go to the district level if one gets one thing in the local level
The more we try to buy locally available goods, Gandhi will automatically become a great opportunity for 150 people.
I reiterate my request to you people that we should take something or the other in the handlooms of our weavers, and in the manufacturing of our weavers.
Deepavali conveys his best wishes and also calls upon us to become more buyers of local goods.
Through this, we have to show how important we can contribute to realizing the dreams that Gandhiji had dreamt of.
Once again I convey my best wishes for this Diwali.
On Deepawali we burn a variety of sheep.
But sometimes our carelessness leads to illness.
The wound is causing.
Therefore, I urge you to keep yourself safe and celebrate your festivals.
My best wishes to Deepavali.
Thanks a lot.
He is always ready to express his happiness and express his support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the valour of the Barakram Parv.
We were reminded of the accurate attack in 2016, and our soldiers gave a strong response to the tacit war that was fought in the guise of extremism against our nation.
Our Armed Forces have organised exhibitions at different places in the country to showcase our strength to the citizens of the country, especially the youth.
See how capable we are, how our soldiers are protecting our countrymen by putting their lives at stake.
One day like the Barakram Mountain reminds youngsters of the glorious heritage of our soldiers.
And it inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, the brave land of Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development of our country will give them a strong response.
India has always been committed to maintaining peace and dedication.
In the two world wars of the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace, even if we had nothing to do with those wars.
This is also a mighty act by our armed forces in the direction of peace.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will always be different.
It is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has drawn everybody's attention by exposing their power in the air.
They have given us a sense of security.
On the occasion of the Independence Day celebrations, one of the aspirations and aspirations of the people on the march is the aerial adventure in which our Air Force will showcase their power with disgusting actions.
On 8th October, we are celebrating Air Force Day.
In 1932, when our Air Force launched a small beginning with six ships and 19 Air Force personnel, today is one of the most adventurous and powerful air force of the 21st century.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all the Air Force personnel and their families who are serving the nation.
In the year 1947, when Pakistanis launched an unexpected attack, our air force decided to save Sri Nagar from the attackers and landed the Indian military's arms and weapons of war at the right time on the battlefield.
In 1965, the Air Force responded strongly to the enemies.
Who would be ignorant of the 1971 Bangladesh Freedom Fight
In the Tiger Hill area, the enemies hid in the hiding places, every night bombed them and covered them with dust.
Whether it is rescue and relief operations, disaster management arrangements, the nation is grateful to the Air Force for the smooth functioning of our Air Force.
Their emotions are wonderful in dealing with all disasters ranging from cyclones, storms, floods and forest fires and helping the nation.
The Air Force has set an example of gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of their departments for women.
I had made an announcement from the Red Fort on 15th August this year that women are now joining the Air Force and with short-term work as a permanent job.
We can proudly assert that not only the male power, but the role of women power is also increasing with the Indian Army's military forces.
Women are powerful, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, an officer from the navy has been confronting the struggle of Abhilash Domi and Jeevan Sava.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abhilash Tomy is an extremely adventurous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel in a small boat without any modern technological support.
Over the past 80 days, he had advanced to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the south of the Indian Ocean, without reducing its pace in the sea.
A few days ago, when I brought out the aspiration from the sea, I telephoned him.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the excellent health of Abhilash Domi, his courage, his dedication, his determination and the power to fight will certainly inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country will know what is important for our country on 2nd October.
On 2nd October this year, there is another feature.
Since now on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we are organizing several events all over the world.
Gandhijis ideas have inspired the whole world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of devotional brothers and sisters.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later, when the struggle for independence in 1945 was intensified, he prepared a copy of those ideas.
He put forward his views on a wide range of issues such as protection of rights of farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
This is called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most exclusive form of his personality.
He created the feeling that everyone is very important and important for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was to transform this into a mass struggle.
In the freedom struggle, all sections of the society, all the sections of the society, took forward the challenge of Gandhiji.
Whenever I give you a glass of shield, whenever you feel skeptical of it, keep this measure. Look at the man who is poorer and weaker, remember his face, listen to your mind, listen to your actions, ask your hearts how beneficial it will benefit the man.
Will this brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this shield of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
If we go to buy something, can we remember a moment's brother
Is it possible to remember the mother's skull
Whose face is joyful
If you buy, who will be directly or indirectly
If this benefits the poorest of the poor, then my joy is strong.
Remember this mantra of Gandhiji, when we buy something in the days to come, when we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji, when we buy everything, our countrymen must do well, especially whoever takes his sweat to make this, whoever invests his money, whoever sows his capabilities in it, all of them should get some kind of profit.
He might have been unaware of how this would happen but this happened and India got independence.
Just like this, today we can see how this small task of mine can contribute to the economic development of my country and the power of economic power to fight against poverty.
But today this is the true patriotism, and I believe that this will be the Karyanjali which we can provide to our ancestors.
He added that all these stones have been strained with great difficulty, and every corner of them should be used.
And there was a serpent in every corner of the gentiles, a small serpent, and a small serpent to the nations.
We are going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sastri with a blessed brother two days later.
His slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a symbol of his stature.
As a result of his selfless commitment to the nation, in a short span of about a year and a half, he was able to provide a mantra of success to the soldiers and farmers of the country.
Millions of people joined this movement and I got an opportunity to serve the cleanliness drive with the Ambedkar School children of Delhi.
The foundation for the school was the respected Baba Saheb.
All sections of the country were engaged in this service on the 15th of this year.
Organisations also contributed very enthusiastically to this.
School children, college students, NCCs, youth organisations, media groups, corporates, etc.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those who want to clean up their contributions.
Let's hear a telephone call.
But if you had not been able to telephonically telephone it was a boon for you after the toilets, you might not have noticed the attention of the people associated with this movement.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to you.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a success story not only in our country but in the entire world, everyone is talking about it.
This time, India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness summit without history.
In the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and Sectoral Experts from all over the world are jointly sharing their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October this year to mark the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mother India.
The Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar contains a number of articles to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993 with the inspiration from that vision.
The Commission is scheduled to be established within a period of 25 years.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also enhancing the dignity of the human being.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a leader close to our hearts, said that human rights are not a foreign principle for all of us.
Our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has enshrined the principle of 'Sarvey Pavandu Sukina' from the Vedic times.
The Commission has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created a hopeful and confident environment for the countrymen.
It provides a healthy society with a belief in the best democratic values.
Today, in addition to the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also functioning.
As a society, we need to understand the significance of human rights and follow it in practice, which is the proof of progress for all and for all.
My dear countrymen, in October, the birth centenary of Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji will begin.
Let us remember these gentlemen who have inspired us all.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji will come and I will talk about it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat. But today, if I want to mention about him then for a few years on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji is being organized in every small town of India, in parts and villages.
This year we have to make efforts to organize this drive for unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
The race for unity is the best way to think of Sardar ji better because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society, every unit of the country by the drive for unity on 31st October, which will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating the festival of Rakshabandhan.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan showcases love and belief among brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Several special stories associated with the Raksha Band of Kapuk are also enshrined in the history of the country by two different regions or people associated with religions.
A few days later, the genmastami model will come up.
All over the environment, elephants, horses, palanquins - Jai Kanhaiyalal ki and Govinda-Kovinda are roaring sounds.
Happiness in Sri Krishna's devotion is the experience of Aladi.
Our youth are making preparations for Dahi-Handi in many parts of the country, especially in the state of Maharashtra.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heart is grateful to you, sister Sinmaiah, for putting forth a good thing.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, we are celebrating the festival of Samaskari on the day of Chiravana Purnima.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bringing this enormous treasure further to the people of Merukuti.
Every language has a special significance.
India has the pride of being the oldest language in the world.
Similarly, we all Indians are proud that from the Vedic times to today, the language of samskrit has played a very important role in spreading wisdom.
The Gyanak Kalanjiyamskrita, which is associated with every field of life, is enshrined in the language and its literature.
Whether it is science, technology, agriculture, health, aerospace, architecture, architecture, management, economy or environment.
You will be happy to know that even today, the people of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are using samskrit in the form of a suitable language.
Thousands of phrases, 200 entries i.e. prefix, 22 prisms i.e. suffix and the possibilities of creating innumerable words of society
That is why one can precisely describe any hot feeling or thing.
We always remember Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
We celebrate his birthday as Teachers' Day throughout the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
I also extend my best wishes for science, education and the dedication of teachers to the students.
My dear countrymen, this season brings expectations to our hardworking farmers.
Natural conditions have caused more rain than any other place.
We all have seen how bad the lives of people have been affected due to the severe floods in Kerala.
Though we cannot fulfill their grief, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you at this moment of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity should get swift benefits.
Everyone decides how to reduce the sufferings of the people of Kerala and how to share their sorrows.
We are aware that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no effort to save the civilians in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Army, Border Security Force, Central Industries, Defence Force and Expeditionary Force have played a major role in this movement.
In particular, at this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the Suras of the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF).
Yesterday, the festival of Onam was celebrated, let us urge all of us to give strength to this festival, particularly to the country of Kerala, to rise quickly from the impact of this disaster and to make the development journey of Kerala faster.
Once again, I assure all my countrymen, the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters across the country that the entire nation stands with you on this difficult occasion.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see what the people of our country have written so much - it is our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Keerthi of Kajiyabhad, Swat Vatsa from Soniba, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
MyGov and Narendra Modi have been collaboratively urging me to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life, Swanna Banerjee, Akilesh Pandey from Kadihar, Bihar.
On 16th August, the nation and the world saddened by the news of Atal ji's time.
He quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he has been away from radical politics for the past decade.
He was not included in the news, he quit from public life.
Though the New Year is a huge gap, the country and the world have seen that after the 16th of August this decade has not created any gap in the minds of the common Indians.
The love, suffering and sorrow that Atal ji had expressed for them has enhanced the country, which demonstrates his immense personality.
Over the past few days, the greatest dimensions of Atal ji have emerged before the nation.
People recall and recall him as the best parliamentarian, a sensible writer, a good speaker, a psychopathic Prime Minister.
Atal ji will be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance in the mainstream.
But today, I would like to mention another dimension of Atal jis broad personality, to touch it and to show that the benefits of Atal ji's efforts to transform India's political culture and the efforts made by Atal ji will be extremely beneficial in the coming days.
It's sure.
India has always been thankful for the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This transformation has led to two important changes in the politics of India.
Firstly, the number of State Ministries should be 15 of the total number of Members of Parliament.
Secondly, according to the anti-party legislation, he increased the size of one-third of the previous members to two-thirds.
At the same time, clear regulations were made to ensure that the membership of the party's detainees was displaced.
Over the years, there has been a political culture that has been built in India for a large number of Ministries, which have not been a part of these big ministries and tasks, but have been created to retain political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Money and expenditure were saved due to his action.
There was also improvement in efficiency.
This was possible only by a prophet like Atal ji, and a healthy tradition began to live in our political culture.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his tenure, the budget was changed at the time of submission.
Earlier, according to the British methods, the budget was submitted at 5 p.m.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of submitting the budget from 5pm to 11pm.
Likewise, today you are seeing the discussions about holding elections at the same time for the central government and the state governments in the country.
On this occasion, let us take a pledge to realise his vision of a Full, Growthful India, I also pay tributes to Atal Ji on behalf of all of us.
When there is talk of parliament, it is spoken about the frustration, shouting and postponement of the House, but if something goes well, it doesn't speak much about it.
A few days ago, the monsoon session of Parliament was concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
Crossing party differences, all MPs tried to make the rainy season more effective, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
Several important legislations were passed during this session, both for the youth and for the backward classes.
This process will help to achieve the objective of social justice.
The amendment to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed.
The Act will further protect the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
Moreover there shall be confidence in the minds of the humble, which shall prevent the atrocities of the guilty.
No civil society can tolerate injustice against women.
The nation is not ready to tolerate the perpetrators of sexual abuse
The parliament, therefore, has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, leading to severe punishment.
You may have read a few days ago that a court in Mandsor in Madhya Pradesh had prosecuted the case within two months and sentenced the two offenders who had committed sexual assault on the girl.
Earlier, a court in Gatni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have promptly passed judgments in such cases.
The Act is aimed at preventing crimes against women and girls.
When we move ahead for the welfare of the nation, we can transform the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time, during the rainy season, all of them together set a special example.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions and millions of people has been on the Asian sports competition in arda.
The first time every morning in public newspapers, on television, on social web sites is that which Indian soldier has won medals.
Asian sports events are taking place now.
I would like to congratulate all sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I also extend my best wishes to the sportspersons who are participating in the coming competition.
India's sportspersons have achieved great achievements, especially in the field of fire fighting and wrestling, but our sportspersons have been receiving medals in so many unprecedented fields such as Wushu competition and boat competition.
These are not mere medals, but a testimony to the hopes and dreams of Indian sports and sportspersons.
This is a very positive sign that our women are among the increasing number of medal winners for the country.
To what extent, our youngsters under the age of 15-16 will be among the medal winners.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Have you seen all of us building houses and buildings with bricks, but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a large mountain, a large rocky single hill has been erected as a very excellent, broad and magnificent temple
India's land has been an engineering testing ground.
Many engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved imagination and have given examples of the miracles in the engineering world.
Today lakhs of farmers and the common people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam which he established across the river Cauvery.
He is a venerator in these parts of the country, and the nation pays him respectfully.
In his memory, we are observing the 15th of September as Engineers Day.
The engineers of our country have set a seal across the globe on the way he has shown.
When we talk about the wonders of the engineering world, we recall a recent incident in 2001 when a terrible earthquake struck Kutch in Gujarat.
When I was working there as a self-respecting servant, I got the opportunity to go to a village where I had to meet an ancestor who crossed 100 years of age.
He used to ridicule me and call it a park in my house at Par-Kutch.
He added, 'This house has seen three earthquakes.
I have also met three earthquakes.
I feel them in the same house.
But there will be no impact anywhere.
Several centuries ago, the engineers of that period had built buildings in accordance with the regional conditions and how the people were able to live safely.
When we observe Engineers' Day today, we must think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural disasters.
As we have met in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, we are openly speaking, we will take the country forward through our hearts, we will be united.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
While India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain shows its discrimination.
But why should we criticize the rain
As a result, nature sometimes expresses its anger.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to be nature lovers, to protect nature and to preserve nature so that there can be an automatic deterioration in the wars of nature.
A natural disaster that took place a few days ago attracted the attention of the whole world and embraced humanity.
It takes usually a few hours to get out of the cave.
But the fate of that day was different.
After walking a long distance inside the cave , suddenly due to minerals a substantial amount of water has stopped in the gates of the cave .
Their way out was blocked.
And they stayed in the cave for 18 days, not two days, not one day, but two days, on a small rock in the middle of the cave.
Just imagine how those youngsters would have to spend every moment in the event of death before their eyes.
On the one hand, they were trapped on a large scale, on the other hand, the entire human society was united, expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out safely.
Not that parents have no sorrow, nor tears grow in their mother's eyes
Crossing so many difficult situations, the whole world was astonished to see such adventures and frenzy in a dark cave full of water, while the boys were not able to loose their confidence.
This incident makes us feel that when humanity stands united, wonders take place.
But it is essential that we should work tirelessly to target ourselves from peace and stability.
Just a few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji, left us alone.
He has a speciality - belief, self-confidence and patience.
The months of July-August are the most important months for farmers and youth.
Because these months they are the peak season of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathyam come out of school and join colleges.
The months of February-March are for examinations, questions and answers, the months of April-May are joyous, and decisions are made to decide which business should be done to decide the direction to travel in life.
It is a very important period in July that the youth's focus departs from questions and goes to the cut-off marks.
The attention of the students goes away from home and the students go to the hotel.
Students get out of the clutches of their parents and join the clutches of the professors.
I am fully confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting a college life.
For the first time, it is possible to leave the house and leave the village and leave a safe environment and start driven by itself.
For the first time so many youngsters have left their homes and have come out to create a new direction for their lives.
Many students would have joined their colleges and some would have joined.
Whatever I want to say to you, be calm, experience your inner consciousness in life, there is no doubt that it is important to read, while also make yourself the nature of looking for new things.
There is a unique value for old friends.
The most valuable of young comrades, while choosing, adapting and continuing friendship, is a very intelligent measure.
You can learn some new things, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new dance.
While talking about the college season, it was learnt that Asharam Chaudhary, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, had succeeded through the difficult challenges of life.
He has been selected for the first time in the medical examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father is working as a sanitation worker and managing his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
How many such poor families have achieved this because of their untiring efforts and determination to overcome the worst conditions.
Their achievements encourag us that the father of Kushi of Nagpur is a voter at the school jubilee, Karthik's father is a policeman from Haryana, Ramesh Sahu's father works in a brick pool and the student Ramesh is also selling sports at the festival.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a disabled girl from Gutka, was born with a spinal muscular atrophy...
All of them, with a sense of compassion, have lost hope in their minds, have been able to see the world back.
If we look around, we know a lot of such examples.
And there is a good thing in some corner of the land, which fills my heart with strength, and gives inspiration.
While talking about such youth, I am taking into consideration the issue of Neeraj ji, this is the meaning of life.
Behold the poems of Neeraj ji: I want to hear the songs of the earth from the sky. I want to invite you all to the light. I want to remove the cruelty of the water from the flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news report and two youngsters had realized the dream of Modi.
While studying it in detail, it was realized that today our youth are trying to transform the lives of the common people by using technology intelligently and constructively.
I was interacting with Indian youth in the city of San Jose, once known as the technology hub.
I appealed to them to take time to think about how they can use their skills for India.
I appealed for knowledge and talent to exit abroad and how to make use of it for the country.
Two IT experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, accepted my challenge and started a new effort.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajnish ji jointly created an App called SmartGaon App and intelligent villages.
This App connects the villagers to the world and enables them to access any information and information on their mobile phones.
The Dudhpurvas of Rae Bareli, the head of the Panchayat, the District Judge and the District Collector created awareness about the use of this App.
If you look at this event carefully then we should consider that these youngsters from the United States are living there in the midst of lifestyle and thoughts, even if they leave India several years ago, they know their village very well, they understand the challenges and are emotionally connected to their village.
This is why it has been able to understand the requirements of the village well and work accordingly.
It is natural for every Indian to have a thirst with their villages and their roots, to achieve something for their motherland.
But sometimes this feeling is slightly sluggish because of the compulsions, distances and circumstances of the time, and if a bit of fire is put in it, this feeling is immediately grabbing it and dragging them towards the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the audio ecosystem, Varkari i. e.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are singing, singing and composing lyrics and lyrics on Bandarpur.
Tirthankars reach there to visit Bhagwan if they are called Vitoba or Pandurangan.
Vittel Bhagwan defends the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with pain and devotion.
Travelling to the Vitoba Temple in Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all extremely unparalleled.
I would like to appeal to the leaders of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity, once you enjoy the Bandarpur Wari.
Several great personalities like Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namadeva, Eknath, Ramadoss Swamis and Dukaram Swamis continue to be the guides to the common people of Maharashtra.
The legacy of these greats has been inspiring every corner of India, giving strength to fight against clothing faith.
We get immense news about the importance of song lyrics, anointing, harmony, love and brotherhood.
And as the great heritage of the great men who sacrificed their lives at the feet of God was in our country, so were the great men who dedicated themselves in the motherlands of India and made their lives appear to her.
Such a great man is the Lord Tilkar, who has set a seal on the minds of many Indians.
While we celebrate the 23rd of July as the birth anniversary of Tilak, we observe his commemoration on 1st August.
He is full of adventure and self-confidence.
The power and innovation that directly points to the mistakes of the British rulers were filled with him.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very inspired by Lokamanya Tilak.
On 1st August, 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak ji passed away, he was determined to build a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately chose Victoria Cardin, in the name of the ueen of the UK, to set up a memorial of Lokmanya Tilakar.
The British were astonished to see this, so the head of government refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that after Sardar Patel assumed office, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a good person, it is because of which it is possible to construct a statue of Tilakji.
My dear countrymen, the special feature of this Thiruvananthapuram statue is that the idol of this Thiruvananthapuram is very rare, in which he is seen sitting in the chair.
I am sharing with you about our years of British rule.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there has been a tradition of celebrating social festivals.
Our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history are still immensely inspired by our young society.
Today, we can see the bundles of worshipping heroes in almost all the streets of many cities.
I would like to see a widespread publicity of the Gita celebrations in every city on the occasion of the eco-friendly Ganapati Utsav, the prize winners, the MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and the atmosphere.
I will definitely take your views to the people.
Every Indian should go through goodwill and the benefits of development.
This will create a New India.
On the 23rd of July, 50 years after the birth of Tilak, another son of mother India was born on the same day.
He dedicated his life to the nation for breathing free air.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
And every young man of India will be inspired by these words that he inspires - Revolution is in our hearts, let us see the power of the enemies, these poems have been an illusion for many young people like Ashfaqullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's resolve and his determination inspired many youngsters.
They risked their lives, but did not bow to the foreign regime.
I had a great deal to visit the village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh, Alirajpur.
Once again I convey my heartfelt condolences to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Just a few days ago, Hima Das, the daughter of India and the farmer, won a gold medal in the 400 metre race in the world-class championships held in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman from the country, has written my letter via email from Indonesia and is now preparing for the Asian Games.
"It is a moment of great pride for me that I have done this in the hands of a young man on the world stage," Ekta said in his edition.
Ekta, we are all proud of you.
You have made the nation proud.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix, a world-class competitor for Persons with Disabilities, has won Ekthan Gold and Bronze in 2018.
His achievement is that he has transformed the challenge of disability into a means of success.
Because of the road accident in 2003, Ekta Bayan's lower organs were inactive, but he did not lose the chest, strengthened himself and achieved the summit.
Another person with disabilities, Yogesh Kadunia, has won the Gold Medal in the Grand Break in Berlin, along with Sundar Singh Gurjar, who won the Gold Medal in Berlin.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kaduniya ji and Sundar Singh ji for their self-confidence and unwavering thirst.
You have to move further, play more, shout cheerfully.
My dear countrymen, several events and festivals of history are accomplished in August, but due to the weather, sometimes diseases also take place at home.
My best wishes for this month of August and for the centuries-long celebrations that will give a boost to the good health and patriotism of all of you.
Once again, we will definitely meet at Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days back, a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore.
You all must have understood that I mention the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first International Desert Festival to participate in Afghanistan, the historic taste of Afghanistan has happened with India.
Afghan President Ashraf Khani also tagged me and said, The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for building a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
It will be an unforgettable one for all.
For the first time, I consider it to be one of the reasons why it is worth remembering.
The Indian team has made an example for the entire world.
We can understand the nature of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is the best way to connect the world and showcase the skills and talents of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that in the future, we will play with each other in the spirit of sports and progress.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, when we celebrated the 4th International Yoga Day, the entire world joined it.
I was told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga was organized, in which a large number of women had performed the seats.
Among the highest peaks in Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers joined together in yoga.
Some of the soldiers were also trained in the submarine.
Likewise, some soldiers used to study yoga on the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, in the middle, performed yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth and humiliated everyone.
The thing to be mentioned is that they did not do this as they sat on the plane, but did it floating in the heavens.
Yoga has been conducted everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports fields.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
There were about 750 differently abled brothers and sisters from different parts of the world who joined together in Yoga training.
Without any restrictions on caste, religion and geography, Yoga has done the job of connecting all the people of the world for centuries, we have lived with the feeling that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and the feeling of equality all over the world.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We are reminded of physicians when there are difficulties
But on this day we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I thank them.
The doctors of our country have made their mark all over the world because of their capabilities.
While our doctors are skilled and hardworking in the medical industry, our doctors are known for solving complex medical problems.
India is a land of enrichment that does not have a historical event or a day or a month.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I will come to Maghar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar went to Maghar.
The sacred Kabirdasar stressed on social unity, peace and brotherhood through the poems of his sages and dohas.
This was his objective.
In his works, we have the same vision in today's world.
Listen to his doha - Kabir Soyi Peer Hai, Jo Jane Bar Peer, Jo Parabeer Na Janahi, So Ka Peer Peer.
Kabir Dasar stressed on social harmony.
In another Doha, what he says...
Where there is greed and blackness, there is sin.
He further said, Jadi Na Boochso Sadhu Ki and Puch Legiye Gyan.
Do not ask of the saints what their gods are: ask them wisdom.
His appeal to the people is to accept and respect the people through their wisdom, beyond casteism.
His comments have been affecting centuries and even today.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji will say that the service done to the poor and the needy is a service to God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of social gains.
All the castes, all sections of the society, all the religions and all the systems can come and eat and Guru Nanak Dev Ji introduced the cooking system called Lankar.
550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India's freedom struggle was very long, widespread, very deep and full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the state of Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place in 2019 is about 100 years, and is a matter of shame for humanity.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji from Rohini, Delhi, on 6th July, at the Narendra Modi App, Dr.
Raman ji, I first express my gratitude to you.
I am very enthusiastic to see your interest in India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jis time is on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
Only a few people know that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in Bengal at the convocation of Kolkata University at the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
This is the first time that the British had spoken in Bengal at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata during the regime.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Minister of Industry in India, and yet, he laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development and laid the foundation for a strong foundation, it is not surprising.
In the first Industrial Policy of Independent India, which came out in 1948, an unprecedented seal of his ideas and vision emerged.
Dr.
Mukherjees dream is to make India self-reliant in every sector and make India self-reliant.
While India is developing large scale industries, she wanted to focus on medium and small scale industries, industries, weavers and slum industries.
During the period 1948 to 1950, he created all the Agricultural Boards, All Regional Agricultural Boards, Patrols and Rural Industries Boards to provide financial and institutional base for holistic development of MSMEs.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jis contribution.
He was keen on the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectual and constructive action, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video.
There was an opportunity to go beyond the files and know directly from them about the changes in life.
When he knew about an ordinary man... his simple words, his language of experience, the event about him, gave him an annual sound like a psychoanalysis.
Women from far-flung villages are providing services from pension to passport to senior citizens in villages through Common Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister has collected bita padam and produced ice cream and sold it.
Like the Anjan Prakash of Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are pharmaceuticals and they are also going to nearby villages to provide cheaper medicines.
Schoolchildren from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important topics such as waste management at their young age.
Throughout this programme, more than the success of the government, I was able to listen to the success of the common man, the power of the country, the energy of the dreams of a New India and the capability of a New India.
On the contrary, there are some people in the society - unless they talk about disappointment, unless they talk about inability, unless they incite distrust, unless they find a path of unity and not a path of diversity.
In such a scenario, when we talk about the events that took place in our lives with the common man, new hopes and new enthusiasm, I don't think this was a tribute to the government.
The story of a small girl from a small village far away turns into an inspiration for 125 crore Indians.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people were connected through this video bridge and you have given me the task of giving me a new energy.
Once again I would like to thank you all.
I have always seen that if we look around us, there will definitely be some good thing in our eyes.
There are people who understand good.
We can also face the aroma of good things.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention and it was a very important combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are also farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers connected themselves with the schemes and made successful efforts to boost the income of the farmers.
Scientists and engineers trained farmers through this charity on how to learn new techniques of farming, how to do organic farming and how to cultivate crops in the fields along with one thousand.
Today they are not only cultivating vegetables but also selling their vegetables through this charity and selling them for a good price.
In another way, I am happy that these young people associated with the world of professionals, engineers and technicians have left their circles and joined the farmers and joined them in the villages and made their way of working together with fields and crops.
My friends
Your youth is truly embarrassing to any young man.
Other youngsters of the country will definitely visit their portals and take care of their work and inspire them about how they can work in different fields of society in their respective areas.
A dream for all of our countrymen, a nation is conscious of the same tax.
If anyone has to appreciate the implementation of the same tax reform system, I would like to appeal to the states as I am.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, a variety of political thinkers are sitting in it, people from different states are participating and states with different priorities are participating.
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but now only one tax is being changed.
The victory for the GST currency is a celebration of currency measures.
As a result, checkpoints have come to an end, freight traffic is rapidly going on, and this has saved time and substantial profits in the goods sector.
Maybe the biggest tax reform in the world.
Normally, such a big reform, such a large country, such a large population, was considered to take 5-7 years to maintain it completely.
This is a big success and 125 crore countrymen have achieved this success.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello.
Once again I have got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I think all of you will remember that a team of six women commanders of the Indian Navy has been on a naval tour for months.
They travel across various oceans and many seas and cross about 22,000 nautical seas.
This is the first time that such a journey has taken place in the world.
Last Wednesday, we had the opportunity to meet these women gems and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate them for their excellent work, especially for proving that the women of India are not helpful to anybody in the world.
Who does not know the spirit of adventure
For centuries, the Everest summit has been a challenge to humanity, and sustained people have been facing this challenge.
On May 16, a group of five tribal students - Manisha Turuve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam - from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra rose to the highest peak in the world.
The students of ASEAN School started their training in August 2017 at Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected as part of the Shaurya Mission's training programme
In accordance with the name, they established the pride of the nation on the Everest.
I heartily congratulate the people of Chandrapur and my young friends.
Accordingly, the 16-year-old girl from India, Shivangi singing, the youngest Indian woman from Nepal, who has reached the Everest peak.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya will be the first fathers and daughters of India to touch the Everest.
It is not that some young people are climbing the Everest height.
On May 19, Sangeeta Behl, more than 50, climbed the Everest Summit.
Some of the climbers on the Everest summit have shown that they have ability and emotions.
In the past days, a group of police personnel from across the border climbed to the Everest, under the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan and Swachh Ganga Mission, but when they came down, they brought together the dumplings with their hands.
This is a matter of commendation, while this activity highlights the urge for cleanliness and environment.
For years people have climbed the Everest height, many of whom have succeeded.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these courageous soldiers, especially women.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I didn't even think that when I had talked about Fit India two months ago, there would be so many responses.
I don't even think that all sections of the society will support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the number of sports that we are playing in is equal to that of the country.
In the social media, people are sharing fitness challenges, i.e., physical challenges, tackling each other.
Today everyone is coming together with this mission called Fit India.
It reflects everywhere that whether they are film industry or sports, the common people of the country, the soldiers, the school teachers, if we are healthy on all sides then India will be firm.
I believe that such a challenge helps us keep ourselves firm and inspires others to be empowered.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports played on the streets were a part of every child's life and they are coming closer today.
In particular, these sports have been an excellent part of summer holidays.
Children will play for hours after dinner at dawn, without any concern or concern
In some of these games, the entire family was able to participate and play.
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Katch to Kamrupam, these sports were part of adulthood.
Yes, they may have been called by different names in different places.
For instance, the game, known as 7stones, is known by a number of names like Lahori, Bittu, Sadolia, Digori and Sadodiya.
We can see unity in these sports in the backdrop of the diversity of our country.
The same game is being known in different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat and I know about a game called Somal Island.
It is played on a 8 x 8 square vessel with a brick or a mattress.
This has been played in almost all the states.
This is called Saukabara in Karnataka and Athu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called by many names in Kerala, namely, Pagithal in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, Dham in Tamil Nadu and Sangabo in Rajasthan.
I don't know to speak in every state language but after playing, I came to know that we have played this thing too.
Are there any of us who don't dress up in a nutshell
It is known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra, it is called Kotibilla or Karabilla and in Odisha it is called Kulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vititalu.
When everyone wins, when everyone plays, we can undoubtedly express the unique characteristics that we have.
You can see that many children are very delicate, but when they play, they become very delicate.
They express themselves, seem to be very deep, and the hiding childhood emerges within them.
Determining the targets, how to reach the mindset, how to create a group feeling, how to help each other.
I can see that our traditional sports are being utilised in the training programmes related to trade management, to promote overall personality and to develop mutual skills.
From children to adults, when everyone plays together, the gap between generations goes on vanishing.
At the same time, we can understand our culture and traditions.
Many sports create awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be produced, played on the streets and pools. They will also watch, play and grow in these games that appear to our new generation.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India is officially organising World Environment Day celebrations.
The theme is Beat Plastic Pollution (BEAT PLASTIC POLLUTION).
I appeal to all of you to understand the significance of this philosophy and to avoid using polythene and low quality plastic, to try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, on wildlife and on our health.
Enter the World Environment Day wed-india 2018, where many suggestions are given in a very interesting manner - look, know and try to adopt them in your everyday life.
When there is extreme heat, when there is floods, when there is no rains, when there is unbearable cold, everybody becomes experts, they talk about global warming and climate change.
Over the last few weeks, we have seen dust, strong winds and heavy rains in many parts of the country.
These have also resulted in loss of life.
All this is mainly the result of climate change
Our culture and our heritage have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Gandhiji brought this thing forward in every step of his life.
We will make arrangements for the maintenance of trees not only to stop but also to grow and grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
The world has repeatedly enjoyed the message of Yoga and harmony for unity in the last few years.
Yoga educates the mind, it always protects us like a father.
As a matter of concern, this feeling is like a mother to children, mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
Birthruhari says that by constantly learning Yoga, the possibilities are our children, kindness is our sister, psychology is our brother, the earth is our bed and wisdom is our hunger.
If all these qualities are one's comrades, then the Yogi tries to win over all kinds of fears.
Once again I appeal to all the nations to take forward the Yoga tradition and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the commemoration of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
I salute Panditji.
In May this year, he is the heroic chakra.
In 1857, during the same month of May, our dancers expressed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers mobilized against injustice and expressed their resolve.
The sad thing is that for a long time, what happened in 1857 was a riot or a soldier riots.
In fact, it is not merely an underestimation of the event, it is an attempt to humiliate our self-respect and self-respect.
In 1857, Veer Savarkar wrote without fear that it was not just a riot, it was the first freedom struggle.
In collaboration with Savarkar, many freedom fighters celebrated the 50th anniversary of India House in London.
He is an expert in handling both arms and weapons.
We generally thank Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has always strengthened the amazing poet, social reformer and unity.
I recall what Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said about Chavarkar ji.
He was a poet of understanding and a brave revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of our women monuments full of aspirations and aspirations.
If you have the courage to achieve something then you will be able to achieve success by crossing all obstacles
It is a story of some people who have dedicated themselves to fulfilling the dreams of others, who live in the slums of Katak, Odisha.
Prakash Rao belongs to them.
You will be surprised to know that a simple man selling tea is bringing the illumination of education in the lives of more than 70 children today.
He provides all facilities like education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his tireless work, efforts and illuminating the lives of poor children and giving them a new direction.
He has removed the darkness in their lives.
Who knows not the scripture of Damaso Ma Jyotirgamaiah
But if one of them had done it, he would have done it.
His life is a concept for all of us, for society and for the entire nation.
There may be incidents of such inspiration around you.
In a few days, they will also wait for the arrival of Prithvichandran.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate Egypt with great enthusiasm and on this occasion the children will receive a specially good Eagle Prize.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated.
When thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participate, then imagine what kind of atmosphere is there.
Is there anybody who has no effect on such an environment where there is enthusiasm, hope, encouragement, aspirations and aspirations are fulfilled
..India has achieved unprecedented achievements.
Whether it is a matter of pride for the soldiers to win medals, it is a matter of pride for the entire country and for all the people of the country.
Encouragement and incentive thrive.
We are all united with one sentiment.
I don't have words to express this feeling.
But I would like to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
I mean, many things have happened for the first time.
This time all the warriors who participated in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhatra has made medals in all her stakeholders.
This is the first Indian woman to win the Gold in the Table Tennis Single Games.
India got the highest gold shooting competition.
India's only Para Power Lifter won a medal in the Sachin's Saudri Commonwealth Games.
And this time, if competitions were special, the majority of the victories were women.
Whether it was a skull or a puppet or a weightlifting or a shooting competition, women boys played very well and expressed their talents.
The ultimate contest of Bhubaneswar will be held between India's two heroes Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
There was a meeting between Sindhu.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am happy that people have joined this movement with great enthusiasm.
Several people have written letters to express their support for this and are sharing important issues related to their sympathy and Fit India information in the social media.
Sasikanth Bonsley shared the film he took in a swimming pool and wrote, My body is my weapon, water is my individual, swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written I feel happy and healthy after walking in the morning
As far as I am concerned, the smile is mixed with smiles, and when we are happy, we should stop smoking.
After seeing all this, it is good that many famous people are also inspiring our youth in the most interesting ways for Fit India.
The film star, Akshay Kumar, has offered a video on Twitter.
His other video has become more popular, in which he can see his hand and play with the people.
Many youngsters are engaging with Fit India initiatives and sharing their experiences.
Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the elderly, men and women should make efforts to connect with yoga.
You must have been deeply contemplated about how to enjoy vacations and where to go.
I invite you to work in a new way today
I can see many young people spending their time to learn something or the other.
The significance of summer training is increasing, the youth are also engaged in the search for this thing, so the training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, the experience of living in a new dimension is beyond writing and calculation.
My young friends, I would like to urge you to do a special training.
Three Ministries of the Government of India - Department of Sports, Department of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water, Government of India - are jointly organising a Swachh Bharat Summer Training 2018.
You can go to MyGov website and register yourself to participate in Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youth will take this movement forward for cleanliness.
Definitely send your reports, and send photographs, and communicate yourselves.
Come on
To gain a new experience, let us create an opportunity to learn during this holiday.
Just a few days ago, the youth of Delhi had been showing something about some of them in India, who are serving to teach poor children.
These youngsters have intensified a massive campaign to educate the street children of Delhi and children living in slums.
This innovative activity began with children begging on the streets or the condition of children engaged in retail work.
Starting with 15 children in the slum area near Gita Colony in Delhi, this movement is connecting 2000 children to 12 places in the capital today.
Young people, teachers, who are associated with this movement, are engaging in an effort to bring about a change in the society by eliminating them for two hours in their daily schedule of work.
Brothers and sisters, similarly some farmers of the hilly region of Uttarakhand have become a source of fervor for farmers across the country.
Their coordinated efforts have not only enriched their position but also enriched the future of their region.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, particularly Minerals, Keeri varieties, Makachsolam and Parli are being cultivated.
Being a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for this
They set up a cooperative system in Munar village, where they built a biscuit-making factory.
Looking at the mindset of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being added not only to 50 Anganwadi centres of Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this organisation has not only reached 10 to 15 lakh rupees per year, but it has also created employment for more than 900 families and it has also prevented people from getting out of the district.
Everyone talks about it but don't we have the obligation
Didn't we feel that water conservation is the responsibility of society
It must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have been doing this for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have discovered new methods and understood how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Tamilnadu, you might have noticed that some of the temples there were big books related to water conservation and drought management.
In Mannarkovil, Cheranmadevi, Mandirbati and Puducherry, a large number of inscriptions are found.
Let us not forget that even today, a variety of wells are known as tourist destinations, which are the living examples of our ancestors for the water conservation movement.
Adalaj in Gujarat and Rani Kee Vau in Patan have been declared as the world heritage sites of the education, science and cultural system of the United Nations.
In the months of April, May, June and July, we get the best opportunity to save rainwater, and the more we are ready for it, the more we get the benefits.
The budget of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Programme (MGNREGS) is being spent only on these reservoirs and water management.
In the last three years, everybody has been making their own efforts in the field of water conservation and water management.
On an average, about 32,000 crore rupees have been spent for water conservation and water management across the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme every year.
In 2017-18, about 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on activities like water conservation and water management.
Over the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted from these water conservation and water management projects.
Seven thousand people working under this scheme have worked hard in seventy days to revive the Kutte Perur river in Kerala.
Rivers of Ganga and Yamunotri, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers Sasur and Kadheri have dried up in the Fatehpur district.
The district administration faced a huge challenge on land and water conservation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, these dried sasur and Kadheri rivers were revived.
Have you ever seen this success in abundance of blessings like bird sanctuaries, peasants, agriculture and villages
Once again I appeal to you people that the months of May, June and July are coming and we will take some responsibility for water conservation and water management.
My dear countrymen, before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have been receiving news from all over the world, letters and phone calls.
Ayaan Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village of North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal has recorded his remarks in MyGov: We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about the philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore who won the Nobel Prize.
Please talk about this thing in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can get an opportunity to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was an integral form of wisdom and wisdom. His writings have put an incredible mark on the minds of all readers.
Rabindranath is an intellectual, diverse, but we can enjoy that every moment a teacher lives within him.
"He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students," he wrote in his Gitaanjali.
I was not aware of Bengali language but I used to wake up early in my childhood and radio broadcasting in eastern India will start very fast and start late in western India.
When you get an opportunity to listen to these poems, you will get a lot of enthusiasm in your mind.
Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have been composed.
My dear countrymen, in a few days Ramlan will start in the holy month.
The month of Ramlan is celebrated with all its hard work and respect all over the world.
The social side of Nonbin is that when a man is starving, he feels the hungry of others, and when he is thirsty, he feels the feeling of the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to reflect on the message and teachings given by Ambassador Muhammad Nabis.
The lesson that we learn from his life is to travel on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked the messenger that it was very important to do any thing in Islam.
The Messenger said, "Giving food to the poor and needy, whether we know or not, is to be harmonious to all.
Mohamed Nabies believed in wisdom and compassion.
Prophet Mohammed Nabi has said that if something is more than your requirement, give it to the man who needs it, so that the slaughter has been given greater importance in the month of Ramlan.
People pay their tributes to the poor in this holy month.
According to the prophet Mohammed Nabis, no man is rich because of his pure soul, and not because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha inspired equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people on the brink, be it those who were subordinated by the Constitution, be it the victims, the deceitful and the oppressed.
There can be no better example for compassion.
Mercy was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha in eradicating the evils of the people.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the spirit of Buddha is bound up with their roots.
This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the best Buddhist destinations of India.
Today, there are conflicts and sorrows everywhere in the world and the teachings of Buddha show the way to eradicate hatred and compassion.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all the devotees of Lord Buddha, to all those who believe in compassionate principles and to all others across the world.
I bless the whole world from Buddha, through which we can fulfill our responsibility to create a peaceful and compassionate world on the basis of his teachings.
You might have heard about the idols of laughing Buddha, but only a few people know that this laughing Buddha is fortunate to have gained his luck, but Buddha, who is a man of fondness, is associated with an important event in the defence story of India.
Well, you can imagine what is the connection between Buddha and Bharat Soldiers.
There has been a new self-confidence among the people of India spread all over the world.
That day is also a Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, India conducted a nuclear test in Bokran, Rajasthan, on its western border.
Indias experiments have succeeded, in a way, India has demonstrated its potential in the field of science and technology.
And it came to pass on that day, in the history of India, that she engraved the power of our armies in golden signs.
Lord Buddha said that the power of Antaratma is essential for peace.
Likewise, today, if we are strong as a nation, we can be at peace with all of us.
That day we demonstrated to the world that India is capable of achieving new goals and summits every day under a strong leadership, the land of India, the land of great scientists.
We can see the new joy and new joy of taking forward the journey that Atal ji had started before us.
My dear countrymen, let us come back to Mann Ki Baat and talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the day of Ram Navami Punya.
On this auspicious day, my warm greetings to all my fellow citizens.
In every moment of his life, we were able to see how much the power of 'Ram' was in the life of a devoted brother.
During the last days, on January 26, all the leaders of ASEAN's organisation came here and brought the Council of Cultural Affairs with them
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries have given Ramayana in front of us.
Ram and Ramayana, not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries in this part of the world, today also have the same enthusiasm and influence.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time, all your letters, e-mails, telephone calls and comments have been received in a big way.
You have heard about the opening of concerted teachings online in Gomal Docker and MyGov.
It is heartening to see their attraction towards harmony as well as being in the field of calculations.
I have told you about the efforts being made by the concerned department in this regard.
I appeal to all those who listen to Mann Ki Baat, to all those who are engaged in the work related to convergence, to discuss how to implement Gomal's ideas.
Kanshyam Kumar ji from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar, I read his comments on Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed concern over the declining level of ground water and it is a matter of great significance.
You have been asking for drinking water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all the leaders.
Do you know what Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said and this time he is appealing to the youth about health
He believes that our youth is physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I would like to talk to everyone in detail about health - a healthy India.
You all, youngsters, can join hands in the mission of a healthy India.
The French President had visited Kashi during his visit to our country during the past days and the sights of the journey were all touching and impressive.
Now I urge you to lease them, re-dewit and bring them to your friends.
Anaka, Jayesh from Chennai, and many more children and Exam Warriors have written to me on the gratitude cards in the back of my book.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that after seeing your letters, all the fatigue of that day disappeared like a dense ice.
Many of these letters, so many telephone calls, comments, and things I can read, many of these things are my heart touching.
I would have to tell you about them only for months.
This time most of the letters have been written by children and they have been written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holiday programmes.
They have expressed concern about the water for animals and birds in the summer.
Letters have been received from farmer brothers and sisters regarding the functions of farmers across the country regarding farming.
Some citizens have positive suggestions regarding water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions have been pursuing in festivals.
It means that Mann Ki Baat changes the weather and the truth is that the voice of our mind has changed the lifestyle of many people.
Why not change
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples, you have reflected so much zeal, so much energy, so much harmony and the thirst of doing something good for the nation.
These have the potential to transform the environment and environment of the entire nation.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how a Rickshaw driver from the Karimganj district of Assam, Ahmed Ali, had constructed nine schools for studying poor children with a deep desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of proper timely treatment, the sister of Kolkata's taxi driver Siddle Lucker dies.
In his heart, he pledged to build a hospital so that no poor person could die because he was unable to get treatment.
Siddul sold jokes at his house to achieve this goal and collected money on his own.
Many travellers who traveled to his taxi gave a heartfelt sum of money.
An engineer's sister donated her first month's salary.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of funds, Cydle Lasker's ferocious efforts have resulted in
Today, due to his hard work, a hospital with 30 beds is being constructed in Punari village near Kolkata.
Such zealous thrilling instruments are introducing and identifying my country.
Today, when the name of India is pronounced with great respect, the unparalleled work of this motherland of India is embodied.
Today, in the entire country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class people, in everybody's heart this belief is born.
We can move forward, our country can progress.
An atmosphere of self-confidence with aspirations has emerged.
This self-confidence is a positive feeling that will realise our dream of a New India and shine our spirit.
My dear countrymen, the coming months will be very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That's why a lot of letters have come about agriculture.
This time, when I see the video of discussions with the farmers on the Kisan Channel for the farmers of Dordarshan, I feel that every farmer should associate himself with the DD Kisan Channel of Dordarshan and see that the benefits shown there should be implemented in their fields.
Be it Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji, Lohia Ji, Chaudhary Saran Singh or Saudri Devi Ji, all have considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and public life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to talk frequently about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and special farming system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that there should be greater public awareness in ensuring better income, better irrigation facilities for our farmers and increasing the production of food and milk.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh urged farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
I had visited the Agriculture Development Festival in Delhi recently.
Interacting with farmer brothers and sisters and scientists there, I had a comfortable experience in knowing, understanding and knowing about the innovations related to agriculture.
But the thing that had a great impact on me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers coming there.
This low land area has done a great job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved macro-economic achievements in 2015-16 compared to the last five years.
If the goal is determined, if the motivation becomes deeper then it can be achieved and it can be achieved.
Today, technology is also being used for the labour of the farmers, which is causing considerable strength to the farmers.
Brothers and sisters, in the budget this year, a major decision has been taken to provide a fair price for the farmers' produce.
Besides, the work on agricultural marketing reforms in the country is underway in order to ensure fair price for farmers' produce.
Efforts are being made to link the rural regional markets, gross markets and the world market.
APMC and e-NAM platforms will be coordinated while farmers will develop and develop the necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country so that they do not have to go too far to sell their produce.
That is, in a way, this kind of system is being developed from farmland to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
How should the nation celebrate this festival
In addition to this, how can 125 crore Indians shoulder to shoulder shoulder to shoulder with Gandhi Ji in a very special way
Can we organize new events
Can we create new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What is the symbol of 'Gandhi 150'
What can be the fury
Write to me your comments on these things.
Today, in the field of health, the entire country has gone beyond the usual approach.
All the health related services in the country were previously in charge of the Health Ministry, but now all the departments and ministries - the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments - are working together for a healthy India.
Disease prevention health is a very low cost and even more simple.
The more we are aware of disease prevention health, the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
The first thing that needs to be healthy is cleanliness.
We all are committed to a nation, which has resulted in double health coverage in the last four years to nearly 80 percent.
Besides, work is being done extensively in the direction of setting up of health centres across the country.
Yoga has created its identity all over the world with a new energy in the form of preventive healthcare.
Yoga guarantees both physical and health.
This has resulted in the efforts of all of us and today Yoga has become a mass movement and it has become a part of every household.
There are fewer than 100 days left for the upcoming International Yoga Day on 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people have participated with great enthusiasm in the country and everywhere in the world.
This time we will also ensure that we study Yoga, we will give inspiration to all families and friends in Yoga.
This should be further popularised by adopting new means of interest, children, youth and senior citizens of all age groups.
Moreover, television and electronics from all over the country are offering various programmes related to yoga throughout the year.
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a mission from now on till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yogar.
But some people have turned me into a yogic teacher through their creation and I have produced three-dimensional videos like Yoga.
A wide range of efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all and prices are cheaper and easier for the goods.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened all over the country and more than 800 medicines have been received at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
My appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat is that you should bring information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy.
This will be a great service to them.
Heart stent prices for heart patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
The cost of osteo-arthritis has also been reduced by 50-70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Suraksha Yojana, about 10 crore families, i. e.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS (AIIMS) hospitals are being opened in many states to provide better treatment and healthcare facilities to people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in every 3 districts.
By 2025, the country has set a target to get rid of TB.
Today, Make in India and Make in India are working successfully in the country
On that day, Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of India as an industrial power and his vision inspires all of us today.
Today, India is emerging as a bright spot in the global economy and FDI is coming to India, the largest FDI in the world.
Throughout the world, India is looking at the centre of investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had firm faith in self-sacrifice.
He did not want any man to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that their poverty would be averted if something had been shared for the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India initiatives have created innovators and entrepreneurs from our younger society.
Today, historical efforts are being made to connect the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being developed on different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in old ports.
Most of the discussions in the 40s were around the Second World War, the emerging Cold War and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar, on the one hand, laid the foundation of Team Indias emotions.
He spoke of the importance of federalism and emphasized the need for the Union and State Governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have acknowledged the mantra of Competition Federalism across all aspects of governance, cooperative federalism and cooperative federalism
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a vision for crores of people like me from backward classes.
He has shown all of us that there is no need to be born in a big family or in a Seeman family to move forward, and those born in the poor families of India can dream, they can make full efforts to realise those dreams and succeed in that.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I would like to appeal to you that you should participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days there are several festivals like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, his sacrifice and sacrifice.
The life and philosophy of Bhagwan Mahavir, who gave us the message of non-violence, will condolence to all of us.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
As soon as we talk about Easter, the inspiring messages of Esunathan will always be remembered, and the messages of human peace, harmony, justice, compassion, compassion and compassion.
Paisakhi Festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
On the same day, Jute Sheetal and Sathuvaain in Bihar, Bihu in Assam, Boila Paisa in West Bengal are celebrated with joy and genocide.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
Today, I will start with a telephone call to Mann Ki Baat from the beginning.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science, some have written letters.
Although the colour of the sea is blue, we all know that due to our daily experience there is no colour for water.
Have we ever considered why you see, be it the river or the sea
The same question arose in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This was the question that created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was given to famous microscopes, which is known as Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence (WAI) had participated in a function to launch the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence (WAI).
It is very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
This artificial intelligence provides an impetus to the creation of robots, b (B) and specific functioning machines.
Today, the machines continue to sharpen their intellect through machines.
Using this technology, we can make the lives of the poor better.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can help in making the lives of differently abled brothers and sisters easier.
Can we know more about natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can we help farmers in their crops
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate inclusion of health services and help in diagnosing diseases through modern means
A few days ago, I had gone with the Israeli Prime Minister to launch the I Create project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who had developed a digital device
If those who cannot speak, write what they think through this instrument, then that instrument turns it into a voice, it does as much as interacting with each other.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Science and technology have neutral values.
There is no self-esteem for this.
Any machine will act as we wish.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered Light Bulbyc, lost his many tests.
Once asked about this, he said, I have discovered ten thousand ways of how I cannot produce light bulbs.
That is, Edison has turned his defeats into a powerful force.
It is not only a coincidence that today I am in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British imperialism, fought against them, and raised many questions against their rule.
As a giant sage, he questioned every angle of life.
He also discovered the answers and paved the way for human society.
Knowing the truth, the feeling of repeated questions is very important.
This is also the true hypothesis in the background of scientists' search.
Why, why shouldn't you live until the answers are not known.
I extend my best wishes to all our scientists and scientists on National Science Day.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has written about Occupational Safety in the NarendraModi App.
In our country, defence standards are not so good at factories and construction sites.
The Prime Minister in his heartfelt condolences on security as the 4th of March is the National Security Day, which will create awareness about security in the minds of the people.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one being cautious and the other being ready.
Safety is of two types, one is important in disasters, the other is essential in daily life.
If we are not aware of security or safe in our daily lives then it is difficult to achieve this situation in times of disaster.
Over this, these words often have no use in our lives.
While looking at natural calamities, most of our sufferings are the result of some mistake.
If we are awake, if we follow the necessary rules then we can save our lives and save our society from the greatest difficulties.
Over time, we might have seen a lot of statements about security in our workplaces, but we might have seen that they are not following.
I urge all municipalities and municipalities to conduct mock exercises once in a week or once in a month with fire brigade.
There are many natural calamities in this country and disasters caused by the human beings associated with the chemical and factory that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the countrys disaster management issue.
Volunteers have been trained and given the name of risk-keepers in flood affected districts.
Till now 2-3 years ago, thousands of people had died due to the heat wave.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) conducted a campaign to create awareness among the masses by organizing training workshops on sustainability from the heat wave.
Everyone's participation had a good effect.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave attacks declined to nearly 220.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We have to become a society with caution against danger.
We have travelled several times, and within the plane, the Air Force will provide defence related comments at the beginning of the journey.
Well, was there an information system
This is how we experience in every sphere of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, emphasis has been laid on waste to wealth and waste to energy generation in villages through natural gas.
GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources, i. e.
The Gobar-Dhan Action Plan aims at cleaning the villages, transforming livestock nutrition, farm crop residue, fertilizer and natural gas through which wealth and energy are generated.
Some European countries and China use livestock fodder and bio-waste for energy production
But India is not fully functional in this field.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, now we are progressing in this direction.
It has been decided to enhance the production of natural energy through livestock pests, agricultural wastes and kitchen wastes.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, farmers, sisters and sisters in rural India should be encouraged and they should not only see waste and waste but also look at them as a wealthy nutrition.
There will be new employment opportunities in waste collection, transportation and natural gas sales.
The Gobar-Dhan Yojana will be implemented in a smooth manner by establishing an online trading base which will connect the farmers with the buyers and make the right price for the farmers' crop residue.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about all kinds of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival and Film festivals.
But a unique effort was made at Raipur in Chhattisgarh - the first garbage festival of the state was organised here.
Inspired by Raipur, other districts also organized garbage festivals for their part.
Everyone shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in their own angle, debated and organised poetry.
An atmosphere like a festival is centred on cleanliness.
This is a wonderful thing, especially that school children have participated in it with great enthusiasm.
I extend my warm greetings and felicitations to the people of Raipur, to the people of Chhattisgarh, to the government and government administrations of that place for organising this festival in a very innovative manner in the field of waste management and cleanliness.
Every year on March 8, we are celebrating International Women's Day.
Several events are organized in our country and around the world.
The Nari Shakti Puraskar is being honoured by women who have done exemplary work in various fields during the past.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led advancements, beyond the status of women-led progress.
On this occasion, I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda's golden voice.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every field of socio-economic conditions is equal.
Today, our women power is expressing spirituality and self-confidence in their actions.
Where women are power-rich and all-round development and stakeholders of the country, it is our dream of a New India.
In just 20 days from 26th January this year, these women have constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets and have set a precedent, including about one lakh women groups.
In the lives of the poor people, women from Jharkhand have demonstrated that women power has the potential to transform it into the nature of the masses by strengthening the cleanliness drive and cleanliness drive.
Brothers and sisters, I was aware of the fact that in the three villages of Elephanta Islands, how they were happy about the fact that after 70 years of independence, I was watching the news two days ago.
I was surprised to know that despite being such a very special tourist destination, it has not been there for so many years since independence even near Mumbai.
For 70 years, the three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajpandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - left darkness and bright light from the lives of people drowned in darkness.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people present there.
What else can be a moment of joy and enjoyment, be it brightening the lives of the countrymen and enjoying their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, just a few days ago we celebrated Shivratri festival.
In March, the Green Cooking Farms, the beauty of the soaring crops and the charming flourishing flour for the soul are the features of this month itself.
At the same time, the Holi Penalty this month is also closer to all of us.
On 2nd March, Holi festival will be celebrated across the country with great fervor.
How important are the colours of the festival of Holi, so is the burning of Holica: for this day we pour all evil into the fire.
Forgetting all differences of opinion, participating in the joy of each other, this is a delicate time for unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App and I urge you all to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla ji died on 1st February.
Although they are not with us today due to the accident in Colombia spacecraft, they have inspired the youth all over the world.
In this context, I would like to express my gratitude to Prakash Ji on the occasion of the death anniversary of Kalpana Chawla ji.
It is a matter of great sorrow for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age, but they have left the message that there is no border for women, especially for thousands of women across the world.
Today, it is a matter of great pleasure that in India, women are progressing very fast in every field and are sustaining the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country, respect for them in the society and their contribution has made the whole world surprising.
This is an extension of the importance given to women in our society.
So they themselves have given the status of women power in our society
It indicates that the wisdom, devotion of the people like Lopamudra, Karki and Maitreyi, the enlightenment of Aka Mahadevi and Meerabai, the governance system of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, the valour of women, has inspired us and has gained pride in the dignity of the nation.
Prakash Tripathi ji has given many more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she was very fond of flying in the air on Sukoi 30 and that the Indian Navy's women team led by Vartika Joshi is on a world-class tour at INSV TARINI.
Bhavna Khand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter drives and have been conducting a training to operate 30 Sukoi.
You're absolutely right.
Today, women are not only moving ahead in all sectors but also leading them.
Today, for the first time in many fields, women power has been achieving a milestone.
In the past, the President took a new initiative.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women who had achieved their first achievements in their respective fields.
These women architects of the country, the first woman captain of marine ships, the first woman driver of the passenger train, the first woman fire fighter, the first woman bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, and the first woman to reach Antarctica, have achieved extraordinary achievements by destroying the conservative threads of our women and society.
They have demonstrated that a new path can be built across all barriers and difficulties with the help of hard work, drive and responsibilities.
They are inspiring not only the people of their time but also the people of the future generations on this path.
They have filled a new spirit and a new spirit.
A book has also been written about these women achievers and the first women who have come here to know about these women powers and to inspire them through their lives.
This book is available today in the form of e-book on the NarendraModi App.
Today, the important contribution of women power is reflected in the positive changes in the country and society.
Today, while we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention about a railway station.
You can imagine what could be the connection between a railway station, womens empowerment.
All the employees of Mumbai's Madunga Railway Station are women.
This time, after witnessing the Republican Festival, the most important thing in Twitter and other social web sites is the bicycle section of the Border Police Force, all of whom are women.
And they understood the adventures, and the testimony made the guests from abroad astonished.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women-power is leading.
It is self-reliant.
The wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chattisgarh has given me a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a definite sight in everyone's minds, where there are forests, roads and women carrying their heads.
But our tribal women of Chattisgarh have created a new vision in front of the nation.
The Dundewada area of Chattisgarh is a part of Maoist extremists.
Maoists - violence, repression, bombs, guns and bullets - have created a terrible atmosphere here.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a terrible environment by running rickshaws operated by battery.
Besides, it is also being strengthened in terms of environmental protection.
I also congratulate the government administration here and I congratulate them for their contribution in the backdrop of the success of these women.
Abandoning the procedures, adapting changes in what is required.
For centuries, there have been individual and social efforts in the country against social disorders and disorders.
A few days ago, a tasty initiative was undertaken in Bihar.
A human chain of more than 13,000 kilometres was organized in Bihar to root out social disorders.
The movement inspired awareness about the evils of child marriage, protection and atrocities.
All the people of the state took a resolution to fight against the atrocities and child marriage.
Children, the elderly, the enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters, all of them came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, this human chain has grown to the border of the state without interference.
If all sections of the society get the benefits of real progress then our society should get rid of these evils.
Together we will make all of us disappear from the society.
Let us build a New India, a powerful and powerful India.
For the past few years, people have been writing and telling me about this thing.
I have also watched many films and social media about the beneficiaries of this scheme.
It gives me an impression that he got the darshan and got the idea of getting it for others.
The objective behind the project is to make healthcare easier and ease of living.
The price of pharmaceuticals available in Pharmaceuticals is 50 percent to 90 percent less than that of commercially stamped drugs.
The use of medicines that are used by the poor, especially the daily routine, is economically beneficial for senior citizens, thereby enhancing savings.
The generic medicines that are being purchased here, that is, the same type of medicines, are in accordance with the standards of WHO.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country.
This has led to cheaper availability of medicines and entrepreneurship to create new employment opportunities for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana and hospitals are available at Amrut shops.
The only objective behind all these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that they can build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra is sharing a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo attracted me very much.
One of them, along with their grandfather, participated in the 'Clean Morana River' movement.
Citizens of Akola performed cleaning of the Morna river in connection with this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Though the Morna river is a 12-month-long river, it has now become a climate.
Another thing to sadden here is that the river has wild turtles and water turtles.
I was told that this cleanliness drive was started on 20th January, 2018 and this movement will continue on every Saturday morning till the river Morna completes cleanliness.
This shows that if one decides to make an attempt, then there is nothing that cannot be achieved.
A massive change can also be brought about through a mass movement.
I congratulate the people of Ahola, its district and municipal administration, all the citizens who have participated in the Jan Andolan, for these efforts and your effort will be a fitting tribute to other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a discussion on Padma Awards being given by the President on this occasion.
Newspapers and television are attracted to it.
But it is a matter of great pride for you to see that we have great pride in being amongst us and getting awards and recognitions without any recommendation.
Now it is not necessary that a person should be popular to be awarded, but his actions are identified as his own.
He has been manufacturing sports goods from waste for 40 years, thereby creating scientific zeal for children.
His efforts have been to ensure that children do scientific experiments with useless products.
For this, he goes to 3000 schools across the country and encourages the screening of 18 films made in 18 languages.
Look at what a wonderful life, great dedication
Their lives are similar to that of Sidhuva in Karnataka.
There is no point in calling him Devi who empowered women.
He has played a very important role in transforming the lives of countless women over the last 30 years.
From the age of seven, he dedicated himself to God, and spent all his life in the interests of the gods.
Moreover, no one has ever worked for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You might have heard about Bajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh, who was born in a very poor tribal family.
Though he did simple work for his life, he had an awesome country of traditional tribal artwork.
Because of this phenomenon, he is respected not only in India but all over the world.
His paintings have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
The Padma Shri award has been conferred on him after his talents have been distinguished by Bajju Shyam, who has distinguished Indias name abroad.
The life of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty can be a wonder to you.
Laxmikutty works as a teacher in the Kalar area, and even today he lives in dense jungles and tribal habitations in a slum dressed with potatoes.
After the snake snake bite, she has been able to produce the drug.
Laxmi continues to serve the society through herbal medical knowledge.
He was recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award for his contribution to society.
Today, I would like to mention one more thing that the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subashini Mistri ji washed utensils in many homes to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital produced by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes we should take such people to schools and colleges and share their experiences.
Throughout the awards, society must take some initiatives.
My dear countrymen, every year on January 9, we celebrate the festival of NRIs.
On the same day, Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the inseparable bond between India and the Indians all over the world.
This year we had organised an event for NRIs, in which MPs and mayors from all over the world migrated from India were invited.
In many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States, the Indian diaspora are mayors and parliamentarians.
Some of them have sealed Internet security, Ayurveda, Music, Poetry, Climate Change Research and Indian literature in many fields.
Some people have been drunk drivers, some have built gurudwaras, some have built mosques, that is, wherever our people are, somehow or the other, they have reformed all the countries.
I express my gratitude to the European Union for recognising the excellent work done by NRIs and for their remarkable work to reach out to people around the world.
Even in today's era, we see how true the teachings of our brother are.
If we decide to go with the help of our brother, what else can we pay him a greater tribute than this
My dear countrymen, I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
Your exchange of letters, ideas and ideas for Mann Ki Baat has always been giving me a new energy.
A few hours later, the year will change, but our sharing continues as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
I wish you all the very best for the year 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated the Christmas festival as a fountain.
We can also see the essence of the spirit of service in the world.
This shows us the significance of the spirit of service.
In our country, we talk about the unprotected activity of the fire, that is, there will be no anticipation of such an activity.
"Seva Paramo grade" means service is the best fault.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
An extraordinary life full of courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh has inspired us all.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a teaching on immense values of life and values and he lived all his life on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji, a poet, a philosopher, a great soldier, worked to inspire people through all these contributions.
He waged a war against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he never gave up his mind for unhappiness.
Every moment of his life, he gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
Have you seen such an immensely special characteristic uniqueness
I got the invitation to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji in Patna Sahib earlier this year.
Come, let us all try to improve our lives by learning from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his visionary life.
Those who were born in the year 2000 or were born in the 21st century, they would be eligible for voting in 2018.
In the democratic system of India, I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I appeal to all of you to go and register yourselves as voters.
All over India, as voters of the 21st century, are waiting for you.
The vote is a very effective tool to bring about a positive change in the lives of millions.
You will not be empowered to vote.
Today, in my heartfelt condolences, I would like to talk about a young society that is full of 18 to 25 years of age, full of dedication and energy.
I consider them NEW INDIA YOUTH, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country, the youth of the country.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be realized by the talent and capabilities of our powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, the New India should be free from casteism, religiousism, radicalism and corruption.
It must be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in New India, everybodys aspirations and aspirations should be fulfilled.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guiding forces.
My new Indian youth, come forward and explore how to build a New India.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 25 can sit together and exchange ideas about New India, find ways and plans.
How to fulfil our resolutions before 2022
Can we consider the dreams of our freedom fighters to build India
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a peoples symposium to create the highest India of the 21st century and this is a peoples symposium for progress.
How to achieve success through depression
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are coming forward and gaining success.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken about the importance of positivity and constructive thinking.
There is a case in English - Pessimism leads to weekness, optimism to power.
Share the positive moments of 2017 and we will welcome the year 2018 in a constructive atmosphere.
I am glad that a large number of people have given positive answers to the social bases, MyGov website and the Narendra Modi App.
Positive India hashtag has also made lakhs of toilets, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this division of honesty has spread from India to the whole world.
The incoming homes and answers are truly imaginative.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of the countrymen have mentioned some of the events that took place this year that had a positive impact on their minds.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I live in Face Onne, Backet One from Maurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to study.
I needed loans for this, this has been easy for me and my daughters have also been able to continue their studies.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm living in a boat.
My husband had made an accidental complaint of one rupee a month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life in the accident.
We are aware of the worst situation that happened to us at that time.
We got a lot of benefits because of the government's help, and we were able to take a pledge.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our BHINNAR National Highway was laid through BHINAR Village since 2017.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and our business has started to grow.
My name is Deepansu Ahuja, I live in Saddakanj in Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish.
Over the past 40 years, we have been dependent on the army's drainage pipe.
Now a drain has been set up for us alone.
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There has been a positive change in the lives of a large number of people due to the multitude of things that they have done at their own level.
Indeed, this is New India, this is what we are building together.
Let us come to New Year with these little joys, let us begin a New Year, let us take a solemn step from Positive India to Progressive India - from a positive India to a vibrant India.
When we all talk about creative ideas, I also feel like sharing one thing.
I have heard about the story of Ajjum Bashir Khan Katk, who has been excellently trained in the State Governance Examinations in Kashmir.
He has emerged from the hostages of extremism and insurgency and has been a distinguished leader in the state of Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in the 1990s the extremists had burnt his old house.
While extremism and violence were over, his family was forced to leave their forefathers.
He has not forgotten confidence.
He set a path for himself - it is a way of serving the people.
He drew beyond adverse conditions and drew his unsuccessful story.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for all India.
Whatever the situation may be, Anjaj has demonstrated that through constructive actions, dissolution of disappointing clouds can be dissolved and melted.
Last week, some women from Jammu and Kashmir had the opportunity to meet.
The moments that I spent with those women have inspired me: this is the strength of the country. These are my young wealth. These are the future of my country.
Thousands of devotees visit this world famous temple every year to receive the blessings of Iyappan.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to convert cleanliness into a culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to make peoples participation powerful.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an action plan called Punnyam Parkvanam and started a cleanliness drive to create awareness about cleanliness.
This Punnyam Park Van Dhan has been developed in Sabarimala and has become a part of the journey of every pilgrims.
There, along with the hardships, a determined resolution related to cleanliness is also connected.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we all took a resolution and the unfinished task of our brother is a Swachh Bharat, a Mass-free India.
He has worked for this work throughout his brother's life.
On the 150th Birth Anniversary of our brother, we have decided to dedicate to him the India which he dreamt of, a Clean India, and to contribute in that direction.
Efforts are being made in a big way across the country towards cleanliness.
There is a widespread transformation in rural and urban areas through people-to-people support.
To measure the level of Swachhta in urban areas, the worlds largest survey in terms of Swachhta Survekshan 2018 is scheduled to be conducted from January 4 to March 10, 2018.
The survey will cover over 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
The Survey envisages that peoples participation will be a measure of innovative initiatives such as Open Defecation Free (ODF) in cities, collection of wastes, processing of wastes, processing of scientific wastes, enhancing efficiency and innovative drives for cleanliness.
According to this analysis, different groups will go to the cities and conduct analysis.
Talking to citizens, they will get answers from them.
They will examine the use of Swachh App and the development of various service centres.
It is also considered whether all the organisations have been set up by the cities to make the cleanliness of the city a habit of the people.
Cleanliness should not be implemented by the government alone.
Every citizen and citizen organisation has a huge share in this regard.
On the basis of this analysis, if your city has a population of more than one lakh, if there is a national level and a population of less than one lakh, then it will be a partial level.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, through this programme, I would like to share one thing with you.
If an Islamic woman wants to undertake a Haj pilgrimage then it was taken into consideration that she cannot go without 'Mahram' or her male guardian.
When I heard about this for the first time, how could it be
Why was this distinction emerged
For years injustice has been committed to Islamic women, but there has been no debate on this.
There is no such regulation in many Islamic countries.
But India's Islamic women have been denied this right.
I am happy that our government has focused on this thing.
Our Minority Affairs Ministry has taken necessary steps to end the 70-year-old tradition and remove this control.
Today, I am glad that even without a male guardian of Islamic women and 'Mahram', this time around 1300 Islamic women have applied for Haj without menstrual guardians and women from different parts of the country have expressed their desire to undertake Haj pilgrimage.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been instructed to ensure that all the women who have applied for such a journey are allowed to go for Haj pilgrimage.
I am confident that India's developmental journey is progressing through the strength of our women power and their intellect, and further progress is going to take place.
Our sustained efforts should be made to enable men to have access to powers, opportunities and women, so that they can progress on the path of development equivalent to men.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day for all of us.
However, the forthcoming year will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
Heads of ten ASEAN countries are also visiting India as key guests at the Republic Day celebrations this year.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
This has never happened in the history of India.
In 2017, ASEAN has made India better.
ASEAN concluded its 50-year term and in 2017, India's partnership with ASEAN reached 25 years.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that on 26th January, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will participate together.
It is rare that there will be no festival on a day or so.
Now all of us have celebrated the Christmas festival and the next year is going to be born.
May the coming New Year bring a lot of joys, pleasures and conquests.
Let us all move ahead with a new zeal, new enthusiasm, new zeal, new resolve and move ahead with the nation.
Makar Sankranti will be celebrated this month when the sun sets in January.
This is a time connected with nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is somehow connected with nature but in our culture of diverse diverse dimensions it is a habit of celebrating this unique event of nature in different ways.
If the pleasure of Lohri increases in Punjab and Northern states, there is a confrontation between Kichti and Til Sankranti in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu all these have their own specialty and have a unique significance for this.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Though these are nominally different, their subordinate philosophy is something that is linked to nature and agriculture.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my countrymen on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to all of you for the New Year 2018.
My dear countrymen thank you very much.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat on September 2019
There is a doubt that there will be no Indian citizen who does not respect him or respects him.
He was older than all of us and witnessed at different stages of the country and at different times.
Not only the people of our new generation, this is a great learning experience for all of us, you are a great concept for all of us, despite all these achievements in your lives, you have always been primarily illustrated in the development and dedicated conduct of your parents.
This feeling is very good for me.
I really don't want to give you any trouble.
Because I know how much you're doing, I'm gonna see how much work you have.
Moti ji: Yeah.
Moti ji: Because of your love, we are very happy.
And Moti ji said, I am grateful for the concern which you have continually shown to me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on my beloved birthday.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought of talking to you.
Let us all celebrate countless festivals like Navratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Puja, Dasra, Deepavali, Baiya Duj, Sadpooja.
In many cities, many NGOs and youth start-ups are engaged in this work.
They coordinate the beads, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and bring them in search of the needy and they do this without any publicity.
This time, in this season of festivals, will we drive away the darkness in the light with full awareness and empathy
The smile on the faces of many poor households shall double your joy in the feasts, and your face shall be more shiny, and your light shall be more shining, and your light shall be more shining.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the occasion of Deepawali, the people of the country are welcomed at home to provide a lot of gestures and a complete life.
We welcome the monks traditionally.
Would we welcome the monks in a new way this time
In our culture, we bow down to women in the form of sages because women are regarded as gifts and fulfillments.
Can we organize events this time in our society, in our villages, cities and in our cities to honour women
A lot of achievements can be made in our country, in our families, in our society, in our country.
Can we organise events to honour and honour these monks of India during this Diwali
Women who have done extraordinary work may be amongst us.
Some might have tried to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some might have been engaged in a social service like doctors, engineers and educating poor children.
As a lawyer, he may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should identify such women and take pride in them.
Just as all of us have driven a mission of selfie with our daughters all over the world, similarly, we will speed up the movement called Bharat Kee Laxmi.
Encouraging the humble people of India means ensuring that the nation and the people of the country live a complete life.
My dear countrymen, I had already mentioned about the voice of Mann Ki Baat so that I get the opportunity to interact with a large number of people who are not familiar with it.
In the past, Alina Thyang, a student from remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote an interesting letter to me.
I belong to Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when my election results came, some people asked me whether you were reading the book by the Exam Board.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After that, my experience was very sweet.
My daughter-in-law, thanks for writing the letter.
Thank you very much for telling me about the grievances therein while studying
I will obey your commandment.
What is your experience in life as per your day
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Thyang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you would be aware of the uninterrupted events of the Prime Minister of India through the newspapers, through the TV, and you are discussing and discussing the lack of retirement.
This time, in the US Open Championship, Medvede's speech, which was the second in the final race, was spoken in a few words.
I also heard a lot of talk on social web sites and then watched the dance.
It was only 23 years since Dan Medvede's simplicity and passion for all.
If there were others at this time, he would have been sad and disappointed, but he did not have any rhythm on his face, but through his words, he made smiles in everybody's thoughts and beliefs.
His speech was welcomed by the audience.
In one play, the zeal of the lord and the adventure of the victorious had made a heartbreaking impression.
If you say that you have not heard of Dan Medvedev's speech so far, I especially appeal to the youth, please go and listen.
There is a lot of learning for all stakeholders and all age groups.
These moments are beyond success failure, and there is no point in success failure.
Life succeeds and our scriptures tell us this thing in a very special way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really amazing.
Mani Kanchana Samyoga: Janayati Lokasya Losan Anand. If a person is eligible for qualification and work, he cannot win the heart of any person
In fact, the young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to say this thing for your direct benefit.
But if we prevent them from awakening at the beginning, it can be very safe.
I want to bear this feeling in mind, especially to the younger community.
You all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful to health and it becomes very difficult to eradicate that habit.
Tobacco users have a greater risk of suffering from diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure .
It affects the growth of brain by its practice in childhood .
But today, I have come to share a new topic with you.
You know, now there is a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
The e-cigarette is a sort of electronic apparatus, different from ordinary cigarettes.
A sort of chemical smoke is generated by smoking nicotine liquid substances in e-cigarettes through which nicotine is inserted.
We all know very well about the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misinterpretation of e-cigarettes has been widespread.
It means there is no danger to this e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, there should be no foul smell in it, so they mix a smelling vitamin in it.
If a father continues to smoke in a house, we may have seen in our neighbourhood that he will not smoke others in the house, he would like to say that his children should not have the habit of smoking like himself.
His efforts will be to ensure that nobody in the family smokes.
He will know how much harm will be done to the body by smoking and use of tobacco.
Whoever smokes knowingly, is well aware of this.
But this is not the case with e cigarettes.
People have no such awareness about e-cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger, so sometimes e-cigarettes quietly enter the house.
In fact, e-cigarettes have mixed a variety of harmful substances, which would have a bad effect on health.
If someone in the neighborhood smokes, its skin will betray us.
The dreams of every family should not be trampled on their feet.
Leave the habit of smoking and do not keep any misconception about e-cigarettes in mind.
Come, let us together make a healthy India.
Yeah, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India means that it is not enough to go to Jim for two hours in the morning.
It is also important to keep away from such things.
I believe that you will not feel bitter about what I say, but it will definitely happen to you.
And these have not lived for themselves, but have dedicated themselves to others.
Only one such gentleman will be honoured in Vedican on October 13.
Sister Mary Tresia, on her 50-year short life, worked for the welfare of humanity is an example for the entire world.
He was instrumental in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world today that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have taken a pledge to liberate themselves from the grinding grinding grinding grass.
In the direction of environmental protection, India is leading the entire world in a way, and today the vision of all the countries is based on India.
I am confident that all of you will participate in the One Time Relief Movement on 2nd October.
In many places, people are contributing to this movement in their own ways.
However, a young man of our country has organised a very important movement.
When I was concerned about his work, I phoned him and tried to find out about his new test.
For the first time, when I heard this thing about plogging, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word may be of great use in foreign countries.
Greetings, Mr. Hello Ribudaman, I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If 130 crore Indians have taken a step in this direction then India will move forward by placing 130 crore steps towards the direction of emancipation from single-use materials.
Once again, Lord Ribudaman, thank you very much.
And to you, and to your council, and to such a new imagination, many of you thank you from my side.
Tengue.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the 2nd of October for preparing for the 2nd of October, but we want to travel on the 150th path of Gandhiji.
We want to transform our lives by bringing about a change in the interests of the nation.
I would like to remind you of something beforehand.
I will talk about it in a detailed manner in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat. Why don't I talk about it just a bit earlier today
You will remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was born.
Thousands of people in all schools and colleges, children and elders, we must drive for unity in lakhs of villages of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you may remember that on 15th August I had spoken from the Red Fort and I had asked you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, perhaps one or the other, should set up programmes to stay there.
Once again I request you people to visit some 15 places in India, please visit some of the 15 places in India as holidays come on the occasion of Deepavali.
And all this has happened only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all for the various festivals in a multi-dimensional India.
Just a few days ago, there was an opportunity to interact with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times team's newspaper 'Vijay Karnataka' published a journal on the children, in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
In that journal they published some selected letters.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Keerthi Hegde from North Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City programme and said that at the same time, there is no need to change our education system and children do not have a country in classroom studies today and they are keen to know about nature.
If we have given information about nature to the children then they will be able to enhance their natural security in the future.
Reeda Nataf, a child from Lakshameswara, writes that she is the daughter of a military soldier, who is proud of her.
If you are the daughter of a military soldier, there is no wonder that you will be proud of him. If Irfana Begum from Kalpurki writes about 5 kilometres from his school, his village.
My countrymen, I am glad that a newspaper has taken this kind of initiative, these letters have come to me and I have the opportunity to read them.
For me, this was an experience.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
The Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Assembly on this day in 1949.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day we recall the members of the Constitution.
They have been working hard for three years to repeal the Constitution of India.
Those who read these discussions are well aware of their dedication to the nation in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they have worked for a multi-disciplinary nation
And when the land was freed from slaves with understanding and vision, they did it.
It is our duty to create a New India by taking into account the clear ideas of those who have enacted the Constitution with the light of this Constitution.
Our Constitution is very vast.
There is no element of life that is not found in it, there is no matter of nature.
It is our obligation not to leave a single article of the Constitution.
Be it citizens or rulers, we must move ahead by understanding the spirit of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any role to play.
It is natural to recall Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day today.
17 different groups were formed to discuss the important issues of the Constituent Assembly.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the draft Constitution.
He was nurturing an important role.
Today, we are experiencing the pride of ensuring the Constitution of India, in its construction, the unflinching stamp of Babasaheb Ambedkar's efficient leadership has been laid.
He ensured the benefits of all sections of society.
On the 6th of December, on his death anniversary, we will remember and pay homage to him as always.
It may be recalled that Babasaheb had played a role in making the nation self-reliant and powerful.
On December 15th, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was his immortal day.
Aithiya Sardar Patel made an extraordinary transformation from the son of a farmer to an iron man.
Sardar ji was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Advisory Council of Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
Though 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget 2611 that happened 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave citizens, the police, the security forces and the survivors.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is one of the most widespread events in the world, every day, in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from extremism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have lost thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India spoke of terrorism in the global arena, many people in the world did not take it seriously, but today, when terrorism crosses the doors of the country, the world governments see terrorism as a big challenge.
This is aimed at destroying humanitarian forces.
Therefore, not only India, but all the humanitarian forces of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
This is the soil of the birth of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi Ji and this soil has given the world the blessings and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a terrible effort to weaken and dismantle our society.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour that humanitarian forces are more conscious.
My dear countrymen, we all are going to celebrate the Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the navy.
You all are aware that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Whether it is the River Sindhu, the Ganga or the Yamunotri or the Saraswati or the rivers or the sea, the economy and the warfare are both important.
This is our gateway to the entire world.
In the expansion of the Chola empire, their navy had a huge share in making it economically bigger.
Several examples of the naval invasions and analysis of the Cholas are still seen in union literature.
Most of the world's navy had allowed women in war operations only after a long time.
But about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the navy of Cholas.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Chola regime had minute technologies related to shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, can't we talk about the openness of President Sivaji Maharaj and his navy
Sivaji Maharaj was dominated by the impoverished coastlines of Konkan.
Several forts related to Sivaji Maharaj's empire, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjeera, Swarna Durga were situated on the seashore or surrounded by sea.
Marathi army is responsible for the protection of these forts.
Large ships and small ships were mixed in the Marathi navy.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Can't you talk about the Marathi navy and talk about Kanoji Angre
He carried the Maratian navy to a new height, setting up Maratia naval bases at many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations, saved many fishermen from drowning and handed them over to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three vessels of our ship immediately reached there and provided assistance to the government and people of that country.
In June, when the Papua New Guinea government sent us an emergency response, our navy helped protect the fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of the country, be it providing medical assistance to Fiji or providing immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries in times of distress.
The Indians have always brought respect and pride to our security forces, be it the land, our navy or the air force, the courage, courage, courage, sacrifice and sacrifice of our soldiers are worthy of every citizens blessings.
125 crore countrymen live a peaceful life because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year on December 7, we are observing the Flag Day of Armed Forces.
Throughout this week, they will lay the flag on everyone as small and big.
A campaign to evaluate soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our armed forces.
This fund is being spent on the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs of war by the welfare of the injured.
You ksb to know about a variety of ways of economic participation.
Come, let us use this opportunity to work towards enhancing the spirit of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of December is World Soil Health Day.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters something.
All the food we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Just imagine, what if this prosperous soil is not available in this world to produce it.
Tree plants will not grow, how can human life be possible
How do microbes emerge
The peasants of this country are giving a lot of importance to the two things of devotion to soil and preserving it scientifically.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions while they are innovative and innovative towards modern science, they are eager to strive and have a sense of compassion.
When I visited the Morange area of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers have been using chemical fertilizers in the past and the soil was damaged.
With the fall in the pocket, the income and the productivity of the soil gradually shrinked.
In 2016-17, the yield of crops increased three to four times in each acre, and the income from each acre increased from 4 to 6 thousand rupees.
Not only this, the quality of soil has also improved.
Due to lack of fertilizer utilisation, there was economic savings.
It gave me great pleasure, my farmer brothers and sisters have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the Soil Health Card.
If we have to pay attention to the treasure, first we have to take care of the geography and if we take care of the geography then this geography will take care of all of us.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can properly understand their land so that they can get sown.
We bow down to the earth, but have we ever imagined how much damage it is due to putting urea on her
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that there is a severe impact on the Earth as much as it puts urea.
How can a farmer bear the burden of illness when he is the son of the earth
The need of the hour is to make this mother-father relationship aware once again.
Can we ensure that the sons of our farmers, sons of our soil, the sons of our soil, will be able to reduce the urea that they will use when it will be 75 years after independence by 2022
We have started experiencing global warming and climate change.
There was a time when cold poetry started before Diwali.
But even under such circumstances, some examples inspire the everlasting consequences of awakening.
Dushar, an 8-year-old person with a disabilities in Madhya Pradesh, has tried to keep his villagers from open defecation free.
The 8-year-old boy cannot speak, but he took his arms to strip.
He rose up at 5:00 in the morning and went to the house of his village and hugged them and made them aware that they should not defecate in the open.
Because of this child who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught him about cleanliness, the village of Kumhari was freed from the habit of open defecation.
This young man is engaged in the task of giving a boost to cleanliness.
This shows that there is no age for me, no limit for cleanliness.
Whether it is small or large, whether it is women or men or women, it is essential for everyone to contribute to cleanliness.
You must be aware that our disabled sportspersons have won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics and have become champions in the T20 World Cricket Championships for the blind.
Various competitions are being held all over the country.
During the past, 17th National Paralysis Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young brothers and sisters from different parts of the country, who have come from different parts of the country, have participated in this and expressed their skills.
One of them is the 19-year-old Jigar Docker of Gujarat, who has no muscles in 80 percent of his body, but look at his adventure, mind and labour.
As a result of his talent, he will now be trained at the Centre of Excellence (Centre of Excellence) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, as one of the 32 swimmers selected for 20-20 Paralympics by the Sports Authority of India.
I salute the young Jigar Ducker and convey my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being paid to the availability and opportunity of persons with disabilities.
A few days later, Eid-e-Milat-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This is the day when the messenger Hasrat Mohamed Saheb was born.
(Today Phone) Mr. Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh from Kanpur.
I would like to appeal to you that all this year you will share with us ten very good things out of what you have said in Mann Ki Baat.
Or shall there be elders in our villages, and they shall never forget grief, nor forget comfort.
We are looking at the past year after year, we are in the midst of ideas, we are taking the decisions and we are making plans for next year.
We are once again trying to recall the interesting events in the media last year.
This includes a constructive thing and a negative thing.
But when we take our feet in 2018, can we not remember only good things, do we not remember them
I would like to suggest to all of you that if you share the 5-10 positive things that you have heard, seen and experienced then you will not feel good.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences this time in our lives
I invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a comfortable environment with good memories.
We will recall the events that inspire others.
We will bring good things to mind and create a better environment.
Good things give us the strength to do good.
We will combine the strength and impact of this joint drive.
In my next Mann Ki Baat, I will certainly try to bring the things that have come to your Positive India to the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will return to you.
There will be an opportunity to exchange many things.
Sat Puja, a sacred day after the completion of Diwali, is one of the festivals celebrated with many appointments and regulations.
Traditional appointments are observed in every case, what should be eaten and what should be worn.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also bound up in this festival.
Prior to Chaturbhuj, the entire house is cleaned and everyone joins the cleanliness drive of rivers, lakes, ponds, worship places and shrines.
Sun worship or Sat-Pooja is a celebration of environmental protection, prevention and regulation.
The feeling of destruction is within the background of this tradition that demands revelation and this evil character can be a major obstacle in the path of progress.
It is natural that all of us are proud of this great heritage of India.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is commendable and critical.
Let us take the example of carpets and handlooms.
Asked how much sales have been made in a shop, the heart is filled with pleasure.
Approximately 680 percent growth has been registered in Gadhi Prize sales on Diwali.
There is an increase of about 90 of the total sales of ear and handicrafts.
This shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women and the elderly are wearing dresses and dresses.
I can imagine how many wealthy families, poor families and families of those working in handlooms will benefit from this thing.
Rajan Bhatt has written in the Narendramodi App to share my experience of Diwali among the security forces and to tell you how they celebrate the festival of Diwali.
You all must have celebrated Deepavali with great joy.
For me, this time too, Deepavali has brought great experience.
Once again we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepavali with our anonymous security forces on the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience to have Deepavali with the security forces in the Gurez area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are protecting the country by facing so many difficult and difficult situations on the borders, I bow down to all the people of our country for that struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
Whenever we have an opportunity, we must know the experiences of our security forces, we must listen to their adventures.
Many of us may not be aware that our security forces are engaged not only in our borders but also in many important tasks to maintain peace all over the world.
They are making India proud as a peacekeeper all over the world.
For us, we are following the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a family all over the world.
India has always been pushing for women's equality.
This can be seen as a small change in the bracket, but it shows a sensible idea.
If you say that India is a major contributor to many of its works, then it will be of immense importance to the ICAI.
India has always been a positive contributor to UN peacekeeping operations.
Until August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 operations worldwide for 71 peacekeeping operations.
These activities have taken place in all parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, the Indian military has treated more than 20000 patients through medical services.
Only a few people would know that India was the first country to send the first woman police force through the United Nations Peacekeeping Movement in Liberia.
This activity of India is a compassionate thing for all the countries of the world.
Since then, all countries have started sending their women's police units.
It is a matter of pride for everyone that Indias contribution is not only with peacekeeping operations but also with the training of people engaged in peacekeeping operations of around 85 countries.
Our unflinching peacekeepers from this land of Gandhiji and Gautama Buddha have brought the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
There is a lot of livelihood among people.
Various circumstances and different cultures have to be understood.
We have to change ourselves in accordance with regional requirements and environments.
When I think of him, the hearts of all the people of the country are proud of him and Paramveer Chakra is the only Indian awardee.
In 1989, he was appointed as Force Commander for Operations in Namibia, who dedicated his services to ensuring the independence of Namibia.
India has always been the ambassador of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
Although he was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
Nivedita means fully dedicated.
In the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday is the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was very impressed by Swami Vivekananda and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was mentally affected by the injustice committed by the British regime.
The British have not only slave our country, they have been trying to keep us mentally slave.
Keeping our culture dirty, the work of creating a feeling of humiliation in our minds has been going on.
Sister Nivedita re-established the honour of Indias culture.
He raised the awareness of the nation and worked towards bringing people together.
He went to various countries of the world and shouted slogans against false propaganda about Sanatana Dharma and Philosophy.
Subramania Bharathi, a well-known nationalist and Tamil poet, has spoken about the new era and their critical equilibrium in the revolutionary poetry of innovation.
It is also said that the inspiration for this song has been received from his sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita has also helped great scientist Jagdishchandra Bose.
He has collaborated through his articles and conferences to communicate and disseminate the analysis of Bose.
To conclude with spirituality and science is one of the most beautiful features of India.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose have a special example of this.
In 1899, there was a severe Black Disease in Kolkata, killing tens of thousands.
Sister Nivedita inaugurated the work of cleaning canals and streets without any hesitation in her health.
He may have lived well, but he served the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifice, they began to play their part in the service of the people.
He taught the lessons of the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is very surprising to hear that children also suffer from diabetes.
Previously, such diseases are called diplomacy, which means that such diseases are prosperous and can only come for those who live in happiness.
Such diseases were rarely seen among the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are not lifestyle.
One of the main reasons for suffering from such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
Social and family are also very important to focus on these things.
If you think about this, you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
We should naturally make a difference to our old habits, to do small things properly.
Children should be aware of the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, the elders of the family can join these children in sports.
Instead of using elevators, children can develop a habit of climbing stairs.
After dinner, everybody in the family could be walking around in the morning with their children.
Yoga is especially beneficial for providing a healthy lifestyle to our youngsters and avoiding lifestyle problems.
Try to practice yoga for the first 30 minutes before starting the school, you will realise how much benefit you will get
If I say it is easy, it can be easily learned and why it is very simple, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for special equipment or ground for this.
Yoga is very useful in controlling diabetes and many researches have been carried out.
The study is being conducted at AIIMS, which is very inspiring to see the results so far.
We do not see Ayurveda and Yoga as mere treatments, but make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the past few days in the field of sports.
Our soldiers played wonderfully and after ten years we have been able to win the Asian Cup.
Earlier, India had won the Asian Cup in 2003 and 2007.
Greetings on behalf of all my fellow citizens and all my fellow countrymen.
Following the hockey, India has also suffered good losses in the game with Bedminton.
Betminton star, Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open and made India proud.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this was the third Super Series Premier victory.
My best wishes to our young sportspersons and their achievements for making India proud.
Friends, this month, the FIFA started World Cup for 17-year-olds.
Teams from all over the world came to India, all of them expressed their talent in the field of footwear.
I got the opportunity to see a sham.
The sportspersons and the audience were enthusiastic.
The whole world is taking care of the enormous event of the World Cup.
When we saw such a big show, the energy, enthusiasm and the thirst of all the youngsters, we were surprised.
The World Cup was successfully launched and all the teams expressed their talents very well.
Even though India could not win, the young sportspersons of India won the hearts of all the people.
All the countries of the world, including India, have enjoyed this grand festival and have attracted the fans of the legend that follows the whole bed.
There are indications that the future of footwear is very bright.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all sportspersons, their helpers and all sports fans.
My dear countrymen, when I look at the number of people who write about Swachh Bharat then I would like to give a daily voice and I would like to devote myself to cleanliness.
Some people send a photo of the attempts of minor girls, some send information about the youth's team's efforts.
In some cases, there is some innovation related to cleanliness or news about the changes made by an official's drive.
I have been given a detailed report in the past about a revival story in the fort of Chandrapur in Maharashtra.
There, a non-governmental organization called the Ecological Protection Organisation was engaged in the cleaning of the Chandrapur Fort through its entire team.
In this campaign that lasted for 200 days, the team worked for the cleaning of the fort without any restlessness.
Continuously 200 days.
On seeing this, your disappointment will turn into hope.
This is a shining example of cleanliness, beauty, social activity and sustained efforts.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
We all have the responsibility of keeping our historical heritage safe and clean.
I extend my warm greetings and felicitations to the Ecological Protection Organization and their entire team.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak ji.
And Guru Nanak was not only the first guru of the Sikhs, but also the guru of the world.
He thought of the interests of humanity as a whole, he utilised all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave the message of maintaining equality in society, not only stopping his message with words but also his actions.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has given three messages of living a fruitful life - proclaiming the name of God, working hard and helping those who need it.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji took his teachings and made a sacred book called Guru Grand.
We will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
Let us move forward on the path of his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrated on 31st October after two days.
The speciality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he was not only a manifester of the idea of change, but was capable of implementing it and providing a practical solution to it, even if it was a very difficult problem.
He was an expert in implementing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel accepted the great responsibility of connecting India with one corner.
In the beginning, he ensured that crores of countrymen should be brought under the umbrella of a single Constitution.
His ability to make a resolution has enabled him to overcome all obstacles.
Even today, our New India is a fountain of dreams and is relevant today.
That is why we observe his birthday as a National Integration Day.
His contribution in giving the nation an integrated form is unparalleled.
On 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, a Run for Unity is being organised across the country in which many people from all over the country, children, youth, women and all age groups will participate.
I also urge you to participate in this run for unity and join the celebrations of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after Deepawali, with a new commitment and with a new determination, all of you would have started re-engagement in your daily lives.
My best wishes to you all for fulfilling your dreams.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat began talking to you in Akashwani.
Today is the 36th part.
In a way, there are allegations of India's positive power, feelings, aspirations and aspirations in all corners of the country, but I have given my heartfelt condolences to the magnificent opportunity to interact with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I have never said this as the voice of my heart.
Be it email, telephone or Mygov or NarendraModiApp, all these things are available to me.
Sometimes individual-related deficiencies, sometimes social problems, etc. are attractive.
I take about half an hour of yours once a month, but people have been sending me information about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always been reminded of the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Thereafter, I received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country, several social organisations, many youngsters, all of whom are engaged in the task of not wasting food.
While looking at it, not only in India but also from all over the world, it has become a massive movement.
This is not the problem of social media.
Every girl child has become a new self-confidence and a new proud event.
Every mother appeared to have a cellphy with her parents.
Every woman has a sense of greatness for herself.
In the past, I participated in a sitting in the tourism sector of the Government of India.
I would like to urge the visitors to send you pictures of a wonderful India wherever you are visiting.
Millions of films came from the corner of India and in a way it became a great wealth for those working in the field of tourism.
Every moment the country is moving on the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something constructively for the welfare of others, for the benefit of the society, for the progress of the nation.
I have learnt, understood and learnt from the people of our country through this three-year campaign of Mann Ki Baat.
This is the biggest capital and the greatest power for any country.
Garbage sales have increased, thereby increasing employment in the households of the poor.
Since 2nd October, a substantial amount of discount has been levied on the threshold.
I once again urge you to take forward the movement related to paperwork and further strengthen it.
When we buy papers, we have to bear the feeling that the Deepavali islands will be illuminated in the houses of the poor.
This is what we have to do for the poor of our country.
Increasing interest in paperwork has given a new impetus and enthusiasm to those working in the dockyard sector and those associated with carpets in the Government of India.
How to introduce new technology, how to increase productivity and how to introduce solar tools
How to revive the ancient tradition that has been disappearing from us for 20-30 years
Sevapuri Kadi Ashram in Sevapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh has been closed for 26 years and has now started functioning with a new dimension.
That is, we have decided to celebrate the Swachhta celebrations across the country, 15 days before the 2nd of October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
We will unite the minds of people through cleanliness.
Our respected President inaugurated this work and the nation merged with it.
Today, the elderly, the children, the men and the women, the city and the village are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness drive.
I had said that this cleanliness drive is moving in the direction of achieving success with our determination and it is spread in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it their own, helping and contributing immensely to realise this.
Sportspersons, academics, schools, colleges, universities, peasants, workers, officers, police personnel and soldiers are all connected to this movement.
There is a kind of pressure that people ask for cleanliness in public places and there is a need to keep the workers there clean and it is a good thing.
This time I had to look into another thing - cleanliness is one thing and it is another thing that we do not waste ourselves from awakening.
At the same time, it is important to implement a visionary movement to become a Swachhta.
This time several competitions related to Swachhta Hi Seva were held.
More than 12 crore children participated in the essay competition.
Thousands of children took their imagination, and drawn paintings.
When we talk about cleanliness, I dont forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this movement forward with utmost hygiene.
They have contributed immensely to the creation of a positive environment by integrating them in their own way.
We have seen in our eyes how the electronic media and newspapers of our country are doing a great service to the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days ago, one person told me about the 18-year-old young Pilla Dar from Srinagar.
Asia's largest lake is near Sri Nagar, in which he was removing plastic, polythene, used bottles and dustbins.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father died of cancer, he added cleanliness to his life.
Pilal Dar is a young age but an inspiration and a catalyst for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
The month of October marks the commemoration of many of our great personalities.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
This year marks the centenary of Nanaji and Deen Dayal.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji quit his political life and connected himself with the Gramodaya movement. It is important to respect his work on Gramodaya during his centenary celebrations.
Abdul Kalam, former President of India, will always talk to the youth about Nanaji Deshmukhs rural progress.
He also visited the villages to see these works of Nanaji.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji will also elaborate on the person at the end of the society.
Deendayal will be remembered for the change in the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the deprived and the underprivileged sections of society in education and employment.
If we think of all these great men, it is not the comfort that we have done to them, why do we think of these gentlemen, then when we think that we are going ahead, the path that we have to go ahead is traversing.
In every city of the country, there should be a massive drive for unity and the weather is comfortable and it is necessary to get iron like Sardar.
Sardar is not they, he has united the land
We should also participate in this drive for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We naturally say that unity in diversity is India's achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, have you been trying to experience this diversity
I would like to tell the people of the country, especially the younger generation, that we are alive.
Experiencing the diversity of our India, feel it and look at its gate.
You can see that this diversity of our country will become a school for the glory of the uniqueness within you.
During the holidays, during Deepavali, there is a feeling of going anywhere on all sides of our country.
People from North India are not aware of what is happening in South India.
The people of western India are not aware of what is happening in East India.
Do you know how many diversity lies in our country
If you say that you have listened to the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam then one thing will be seen - when they look around India, there was a new inspiration to see and understand India and to dedicate their lives for that.
All these gentlemen looked around India completely.
They tried to understand and understand India before their actions.
They tried to see India live within themselves.
Whether our various states, different societies, groups, their habits, their traditions, their wealth, their food systems and their beliefs cannot be tried to learn, understand and live as a student
The value of tourism is not limited to going and stopping, but we are becoming a student.
I have the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
This is the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food
If you have every kind of food every day in your life then there is no chance of eating the same food again and there are so many kinds of food.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these vacations, you should leave the house and not stop, you are not going for a change but you should go out with the aim of knowing about things.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your vision will be vast.
Tell me, who else could be bigger than your experiences
If you go this time too, you will take this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, and share photos.
Definitely send your photos to Incredibleindia.
If you meet the people there, send them photographs.
There is a feeling in my mind that to give a boost to the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven best tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those seven places of your state, if possible, you should go to those seven places.
Assisted by this, can you provide any information about this
Can we reveal this on the NarendraModiApp
Can we know this in Incredible India
I would like to tell the government that if many people from a state say this thing then I would like to examine it and publish advertising journals about which seven places have been said in every state.
How can we take the tourist destinations forward in a way with the views of the people
Similarly, you can imagine that the places you have visited all over the country, whichever of them you have the best 7 places, the others must visit this place, visit this place and get information about these things.
Come, join me.
During the period from October to March this year, you can become a catalyst in encouraging tourism in the country.
I'm calling you.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you
Perhaps it has come to your attention that has happened in the past - the countrymen must have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
Two brave soldiers - Lieutenant Swati and Finance - are extraordinary heroes for the Indian Army.
I tell you why extraordinary people have lost their lives in the service of Bharatmata, the husbands of both Swati and Nidhi.
When they rise to the world at this young age, you imagine how they're psychological
But the martyr, Col Santosh Mahadik's wife, Swati Mahadik, confronted himself with such difficult situations and made his mind strong and joined the Indian Army.
He trained hard for 11 months and joined the army to realise his husband's dream.
Likewise, Tubey's husband Mukesh Dubey, who served as the army's hero, survived the service of the Thailand, boosted the frustration that his wife, Nidhi, would join the army.
Every citizen has no doubt that our mother power will be respected and respected.
My dear countrymen, Navratri Festival and Deepawali have got a great opportunity for the youngsters of our country.
FIFA (FIFA) is scheduled to be held here for 17-year-olds.
I am confident that there will be a footprint on all four sides.
Encouragement on footprint will increase for every generation.
Everyone should play this game so that there are no youngsters who do not play football in any school in India.
Come, when all the countries of the world come to play on Indian soil, we will make sports a part of our lives.
Friends, Navaratri is going on.
It's time to worship Mother Durga.
The environment is full of sacred comfort.
On all sides there is a spiritual atmosphere, a spiritual atmosphere and a devotional atmosphere.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my best wishes to the countrymen, I urge Mother Bharakti to fulfil the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country and take the nation to new heights.
The country has to get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The nation must move ahead at a rapid pace, at the time of 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, the effort to realise the dreams of the freedom fighters, the determination of the 125 crore Indians, the uninterrupted labour, unemployment, unemployment and mentality, we should move ahead with the five-year plans for a New India and give us our blessings.
My best wishes to all of you.
Engage in celebrations, spread the cavalry.
This country was born by Buddha and Gandhi and Sardar Patel for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have been honouring and respecting the values and values that are usually observed.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: - We have been listening to this sentence since our childhood.
This diversity is not found only in food habits, habitats and dresses
This diversity is visible in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organised in accordance with the schedule of nature.
All these have a direct connection with nature.
Many of our festivals are linked to farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk about festivals with you, I would like to say that it is a sad moment for all of you.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival yesterday.
The festival of Paryushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is on the last day of the celebrations.
This is a wonderful tradition.
Samvatsari marks the day of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This celebration is a symbol of time, unity, equality and cleanliness.
Greetings on the auspicious occasion of Pilgrimage.
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala.
Keralas Onam is one of the most colourful festivals of India.
Nowadays our festivals have become a factor of attraction for tourism.
I would like to tell my countrymen that be it Navaratri festival in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal, these are tourist attractions in a way.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in this direction.
Eid-ul-Suha will be present in the festival series within a few days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should be a factor for cleanliness.
Festivals and hygiene are connected to family life.
Preparation for a festival is to focus on cleanliness and health.
Although this is not a new thing for all of us, it is essential to change it into a social organism.
They put colours in them, one puts vegetable colours, one puts paper pieces in it.
Every family is performing a variety of applications.
In a way, the biggest exercise of environmental awareness has been seen for the first time in this book festival.
Three years ago, we started the Swachhta campaign and we will complete three years on 2nd October.
Its positive consequences are emerging.
Toilet areas have reached about 67 percent from 39 percent.
The people of Jamia Ulema-e-Hind have demonstrated an exemplary example of unity and inspiring for all.
If the efforts made with dedication and commitment towards cleanliness becomes a constant nature, then no height can be attained by our country
When will we get the opportunity, where will we get the opportunity
But we all have to join this thing.
Let us consider this as a preparation for Deepavali or a preparation for Navaratri or a preparation for Durga Puja.
We will do physical service.
We will work together on holidays and on Sundays.
We will go to the neighbouring habitations, we will go to nearby villages, but we can do this as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental organisations, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district regimes and panchayat leaders - 15 days before the 2nd of October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we will create an atmosphere related to cleanliness.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.
After the toilet is constructed, you can register the names of those whom you have helped in the construction of your name and toilet.
My social friends can step up some positive movements and you can motivate them to work at the grassroots level.
The theme Success in Cleanliness through Sanitation is Success in Cleanliness, organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for essay competition, short film making competition and painting competition.
You can write articles in many languages and have no age.
You can produce a short film and produce it on your mobile phone.
2-3 minute short film should be produced and it should be an inspiration for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
After organizing this cleanliness drive for 15 days, when we celebrate 2nd October, when we have seen Gandhiji who had gifted him with joy, you can enjoy the cleanliness.
Hundreds of thousands of people write letters, give information, and many are delivering news through telephone, this is a great wealth for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the hearts of the countrymen.
I look forward to your messages more than you wait for the voice of your heart.
I am thirsty because every one of your things gives me the opportunity to learn.
Yes, I too have made such a mistake.
Sometimes we will not even be able to tell us how many things are naturally transformed.
Prime Minister, I am talking to Aparna from Pune.
I would like to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but one of her actions makes me feel frustrated.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
She spent 2000 rupees without any difficulty in buying a sack, then she spent 450 rupees and bought beats.
But the Auto driver, who used the campus to come, was actively involved in a deal worth 5 rupees.
When she bought vegetables on the way back, she bargained at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
I have a lot of trouble.
We buy goods without asking any questions in bigger places, we fight against our brothers and sisters who work and live for retail money.
I am sure that after listening to this phone call, you might be surprised, why can you be ashamed and you might be convinced that I will not behave like this.
Have you ever imagined what will happen to the poor
My young friends, the entire nation is going to celebrate 29th August as a day of all sports.
This is the birth anniversary of Maj Thyaan Chand, who is a hockey sportsperson and mayor of the Hockey world.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I am reminded of this thing that the younger community of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become part of our lives.
As we are a young nation in the world, we must reflect in our young sports fields.
What else do you want to say is physical strength, consciousness and governance.
Sports in a way is a bridge that connects minds.
I would like to assert that the younger generation of our country should move ahead in the sports world and that in today's world, the playground is more important than the calculated sporting instrument.
FIFA can play football in calculations, but I can see football playing on the ground.
You can play cricket in calculations, but play under the sky in the field, its joy is incredible.
Sometimes when all the kids in the house go out, they ask you when the mother will come back.
In today's era, it has changed, as soon as children come home, they sit in a corner and start watching a cartoon or drown in mobile cameras.
If there is any record in the field of sports, if any of the children of the country have the talent then they can provide information or video to them on this portal.
The portal will be inaugurated tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to train selected and developing sportspersons.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, the FIFA is organising a World Cup for 17-year-olds.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world are playing in India.
Let us welcome young guests from many countries through sports festivals, let us enjoy sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, in the last weeks, my heart-touching event took place and I would like to share with you about it.
Six such women are working in the navy.
Their emotions and their inspiration give us a boost.
These six women's wealth is also travelling in a small boat INS TARINI and trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
And they shall return to India round about the world, after many months.
Sometimes they will spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes we may have to spend about 30 days in water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our six womens wealth travels with adventure and for the first time in the world.
I am also organising an exclusive course for their experiences at the NarendraModi App.
You must read it because it will be my joy in sharing with you the experiences of a story full of courage, a story full of self-experience and the experiences of these women wealth.
My heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he presided over a literary career throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a teacher.
He was dedicated to the academy.
While he was the President of India as an adviser, he was a vibrant poet every moment.
I remember him.
This time, when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all collectively take a pledge
Because of its efforts, the events that have succeeded in bringing about change in the lives of every teacher will certainly be there in the lives of every teacher.
If we make social efforts then we can transform the country and we can play a very big role in it.
Let us learn to change, let us take this mantra forward.
Ananya Ashti.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre at Howard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you that in 2014, when you had started your Jan Dhan Yojana, today after three years, whether India is financially safer, whether it is power-sharing, this power-sharing and facilities have reached our women, farmers, workers, villages and huts, tell us what the data is telling.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked about the financial inclusion which has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the economic world.
I had launched this project on 28th August 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be launched on 28th August and three years will be completed.
30 crore new households have been added and bank accounts have been opened.
This is a higher number than the number of countries in the world.
Perhaps, if the money is pierced in the hand, if it is in the pipe, if it is in the house, it will inspire the mind to spend waste.
65,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).
In a way, this saving of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, those who have opened their bank accounts will get insurance benefits.
Today, a new confidence has been created in the lives of the poor by paying a very simple fee of one rupee and 30 rupees to the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
If a poor person dies due to the cost of one rupee per family then he gets Rs. 2 lakh per family.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana and Stand Up Yojana, crores of youngsters have been provided with the help of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, be it tribal or women or be it educated youth or be it self-reliant or be it self-reliant or be it self-reliant or be it the youth of the country or be it the youth of the country or be it the youth of the country or be it Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana or be it Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana
They are not only on their own feet but also on successful efforts to provide employment to two and a half people.
During the last few days some people from the banking sector had come to meet me and they had analyzed the benefits of Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will do my best to bring these things to your notice.
These include events that can be fully utilized by even the media.
They can also interact with such persons and create a new vision for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again my thoughts are with you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at Indian Radio in Agricultural
Rainy season is a time when people lose their hearts.
Animals, birds, plants and nature all flourish with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when this rain is extremely heavy, we know how much water is capable of destroying it.
It is Mother Nature that gives us life, we all grow, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes and their desperate form have caused a lot of destruction.
Changing climate and climate change have a negative impact.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, there have been natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
Comprehensive surveillance operations are being carried out in flood affected areas.
State governments are also making great efforts to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and even emotional citizens are making full efforts to help the people in this situation.
Farming, livestock wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In particular, in order to compensate our farmer brothers for the losses incurred by them and their produce, we have made plans for the livelihood of insurance companies, especially the crop insurance companies.
Besides, 24-hour operational support number of 1078 is also fully operational to combat the floods.
People are expressing their hardships in this regard.
Before the start of the monsoon, the entire government machinery was put in place to watch the training drive at the majority of the seats.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were intensified.
They were trained to develop a disaster resilient organisation, to do what they should do, to decide volunteers, to create a peoples organisation and to act in such situations.
Nowadays, weather is already being calculated, technology has grown, space science has played a major role in calculating this, and we have almost got the right calculation.
Gradually, according to the climate calculations, we have to change our activity, and to protect ourselves from disaster prone effect.
Whenever I prepare myself for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see the people of our country engaging in the preparations for it.
This time there have been a number of letters and telephone calls on the Goods and Services Tax
Even now, people have expressed their happiness over the goods and services.
I would like to hear this telephone call: Greetings, Prime Minister, I would like to say Garg from Gurugram.
Having spent a month, will you have the same results as you expected
I want to know your thoughts about this. Thank you.
The Goods and Services Tax has been implemented for nearly a month and the results have started to be known.
I can see how this new reconstruction system has impacted the transport and services sector.
Materials are also moving very fast.
Despite this facility, it has also added strength to economic pace.
Because of the earlier separate taxation system, most of the resources of the Transport and Services Department were spent in the maintenance of the documents and new warehouses had to be set up in every state.
This tax, which I say, is a good and simple tax, has indeed made a very positive impact on our economic system in a very short time.
The pace at which there has been a paradigm shift, the pace at which there has been a renewed pace and new records have been registered, all these have created a new hope in the entire country.
In many of the world universities, it will become a model analysis.
Because such a massive change in such a large scale, with the participation of crores of people, successful implementation of this system in such a large country can be considered as a great success.
S. T.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All decisions and states have been taken in a unanimous manner in collaboration with the Union Government.
The price of a specific commodity through the App before the restructuring and after the new reconstruction, everything is available on your mobile phone.
This is a historic victory, a historic achievement.
This is also a social reform movement.
My heartfelt condolences to millions and millions of people who have made such a big effort in a very natural way.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the revolution.
Naturally, we have heard about this thing since our childhood and the reason for this was the start of the Cooperation Movement in August 1, 1920.
Then, on 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement began, and we know it as the August Revolution
Next August, 1947, the country got independence on 15th August.
In a way, many events in the month of August are closely linked to the history of liberation.
This year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But the White House has raised the slogan to quit Dr.
Some people knew that Yusuf Meher Ali was the only one.
Our new generation should know what happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we have to inspire ourselves to build a great India, the historical pages of our countrymen, who have joined them in the liberation gallery, who binded themselves in the liberation gallery.
What else can be a greater motivation than the sacrifices, sacrifices and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is a very important struggle for India's freedom movement.
It was this struggle that gave the entire nation a determination to get rid of the British rule.
At that time, all of them joined their shoulders against the British regime, in every corner of Hindustan, in villages, cities, educated, uneducated, poor and wealthy, and participated in the White House uit India struggle against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at the peak.
Hundreds of thousands of people listened to the challenges of Gandhiji, bearing the mantra of 'Deathmadi' in our minds and taking the struggle forward.
Millions of youngsters from across the country have blessed their lessons and books in the freedom struggle.
The song of freedom was sounded, they went ahead.
Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan have played an important role in this regard.
Gandhijis two different dimensions are reflected in the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the White House Movement of 1942.
The dimensions of non-cooperation differed, the extent to which the independence of 1942 had increased, there was a need to present a mantra like Gandhiji a mantra of 'Dead' or 'Dead Madi'.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1857, continued till 1942, every moment in some part of the country.
This protracted period had created a free hunt for the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no depression in depression.
People continued to come, involved themselves, went and newcomers came, they joined themselves, they shook the British regime and made everyday efforts in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new situation, which led to the height of 1942.
In 1947, the British had to leave the country within five years.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle had reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were a manifestation of the demoralization of the people and were a cause of liberation.
These five years they're determined years.
Now I want to connect you with these accounts.
In 1947, we achieved independence.
Today we are in 2017.
They ran for nearly 70 years.
The governments came.
Organisations grew, transformed, flourished and developed.
Everyone has tried their own way to relieve the nation from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment, eradicate poverty and grow in the country.
Efforts were made in their own ways.
We also got success.
We must celebrate the 15th of August this year as a day of Sabbath, 75 years after the independence of the country in 2022.
On the 15th of August, when everybody will make a solemn pledge for the country as a citizen, I will do so for the country as a family, I will do this as a society, I will do this as a city, I will do this as a government department and I will do this as a government.
Millions of people have to make a pledge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil the promises made.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were the decisive years of the country's independence, similarly, from 2017 to 2022, these five years will change for the years that will determine the future of India.
We are celebrating 75 years after the independence of the country.
Every citizen, every social organisation, every local body, every school, college, every institution, every institution should make a new India.
May this be a solemn pledge to triumph over the next five years.
What goal should we achieve as a nation
As an individual, what can my contribution be
Use technology and come forward with the help of videos, posts, plastics, articles and new ideas.
Let us transform this movement into a peoples movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will compete with young social friends on the uit India Movement.
This is an attempt to connect the youth with the proud history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message very well.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of India, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort.
I'm an instrument.
I read them myself and I will try to reveal them on August 15 as long as I have.
A charge has been made before me that the speeches I delivered on August 15 last three times have been a little longer.
I am trying to lay down the rules for me and I don't know if I can do it.
But I have the hope that this time I will try to summarize my speech.
I can see if I have a success or not.
My dear countrymen, I also want to talk to you about another thing.
India's economic system includes a social economy.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just a moment of joy.
Our festivals and festivals are also a movement for social rejuvenation.
But even more, each of our festivals have a direct connection to the economic life of the poor.
A few days later, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, Pillayar Chaturthi, then Saud Chandra, then Anant Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Deepavali will come together.
These connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between these two continues.
Ah Seh Abhiyan means that from the point of view of me we are moving forward.
In terms of economic status, even months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, many families have started producing rocks as a small slum industry.
Different kinds of rocks are made from cotton to silk mills
But today people have started enjoying the rocks being produced at home.
This is directly linked to the poor artisans who produce small lamps.
But today, while talking about festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I would like to clarify the environment.
Sometimes I see that the people of our country are more conscious and constructive than me.
Over the last one month, aware citizens have been writing to me about the environment.
You have already requested me to talk about the environment friendly child before the Pilgrim Chaturthi so that the desire for the child on earth can be increased from now on.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the citizens of this kind of awareness.
At the same time, it is our commitment to create an eco-friendly, soil-made child tuberculosis in order to preserve the environment.
This time I have said this thing very early
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
Just a few days back, our women and women have done a great job in the Cricket World Cup.
This week, I got the opportunity to meet all of them.
It gave me great pleasure to interact with them, but I realized that they were pressing them on the burden that they could not win the World Cup.
The pressure on their faces boiled the crisis.
I gave them a different assessment on my side.
Look, today's era is a media world, the expectations have increased, the scale of success has not been achieved, it becomes angry.
If India's sportspersons fail, we have seen the anger of the nation on those sportspersons in many sports.
They praised and praised the achievements made by these women, not just stopping them.
In fact, the youngsters of our country, especially women, are engaged in a lot of things to make the nation proud.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the younger community, especially to our women.
We all have to take the nation to new heights, take them and take them to new heights.
Come, let us travel together, let us travel by doing something.
We will move ahead with the hope that the future of the nation will be better.
Many congratulations.
Climate is changing.
After the rains, the cold wind has given some assurance from the heat of summer over the past days.
No matter how much trouble is faced in life, no matter how much trouble it is, we can feel that there is a change in the mindset of all of us in the individual life, in the public life, in the rainy season.
The poor of the country is spiritually connected with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, there is a word called juggernaut, which means that anybody cannot stop it.
When we looked at Agarathi, we came to know that this word 'Jagarnout' has emerged on the rath yatra of Jagannath.
On seeing all these things, we can understand how the world has adopted this greatness in its own way.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens.
Come, let us all collectively take inspiration from these holy festivals and share the joys of happiness and take the country forward in the path of development.
In this holy month of Ramlan, we are reminded of a very concentrated event in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters living in this small village with their families and in a way there are brothers and sisters of a large number of Islamic families.
In the month of Ramlan, the villagers collectively resolved to build a toilet.
So they have said that they should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy occasion of Ramlan for the welfare of the society.
We know that in our country, states like Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttaranchal and Haryana have been declared open defecation-free states this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration, rulers and the people of these five states.
We are aware that if we want to do something good or not in individual life or in social life then we have to work hard.
If our signature is bad, if we think that it should be corrected then we should make a lot of time conscious and make an effort.
Only then will it become a physical and mental habit.
Similarly, some other evil habits are inherent in our nature.
We must draw everyone's attention.
We must recall the inspiring events.
I am glad that today cleanliness is not limited to the government level.
This has been transformed into a mass movement.
This happened in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
Out of 71 Village Panchayats in 100 hours, 1000 household toilets are being constructed.
My dear countrymen, the people and the government will be happy to note that they have been successful in constructing 1000 toilets in 100 hours.
in and through letters and aerospace.
Shri Prakash Tripathi recalled the urgent situation and said that on 25th June, he was the greatest guy in the history of democracy.
It is a commendable admiration for Prakash Tripathi for his awareness about democracy. This is not just a system but a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
Nobody can easily forget it on the 25th of June, 1975, a dark night.
No Indian can leave it.
The country's great leaders, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were all locked in prisons.
The students of today's media world, all those working in the democratic system, are constantly trying to create awareness to remind them of the dark age.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Having been declared an emergency in the country for one year, Atal ji wrote a poem, describing the situation in the country during that period.
We must further strengthen this tradition.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels a lot of pride with his head.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world is Yoga.
Everyone from water to hill welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Yoga was not that it was earlier, but today all have joined the path of Yoga and Yoga has become a bridge that connects the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have turned this opportunity into an opportunity for you.
More than 4,000 people from the United Arab Emirates' Abu Dhabi are engaged in yoga on the Chinese masses and on Machu Pichu, the world's heritage symbol, at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level.
In Herad, Afghanistan, India joined Yoga at the Salma Dam, an Afghan ally, and set a new thread for friendship.
Even in smaller places like Singapore, programmes were organised at 70 locations and they had taken up the movement for a week.
This time again Yoga has been a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made Yoga a new world record.
I got an opportunity to study Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, Yoga has become a good opportunity.
Even in Siachen with a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees, our soldiers were engaged in Yoga art.
Our Army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Federal Reserve Police Forces, Central Industrial Security Forces, all have done their duties and practiced Yoga.
As this is the 3rd International Day of Yoga, I had requested the families of 3 generations to take a picture of Yoga and share it with me.
Some television channels also took the matter forward.
I have been sent photographs by a large number of people who have been selected from the Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I bow down to Dr.
I'm talking about Anil Sonara.
Sir, I recall that you have recently mentioned in Kerala that instead of putting bouquet in different places, we can give good memorial books.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country, Sir.
I liked it very much.
I am once again reminded of one thing that has escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we should no longer offer bouquets, give books or welcome handcuffs and welcome them.
And that too, we will give a handkerchief because it will give a boost to the doorstep.
It was a habit when I was in Gujarat but this habit has become a habit after I came from there.
But when I went to Kerala, I got awakened again.
But when we give books, in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can also welcome you even if you offer charcoals, so how many poor people are helpful
The reduction in costs can also be used properly.
These things have historical significance.
When I visited the UK last year, the ueen Elizabeth's mother had invited me to a feast in London.
When I was married, Gandhiji conveyed his best wishes to me and gave me this handcuff, he said in a loud voice.
For many years, but Elizabeth's queen kept the handcuffs prized by Gandhiji safe.
A very small love of Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits do not turn into night, but are subject to criticism.
At the same time, we need to engage in such interactions.
For this, whenever I go anywhere, if someone brings a potato, I will not deny that I will not do that.
Criticism will only emerge, we have to repeat, gradually bring about a change.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country, there are many issues.
Despite being immersed in the files, I am developing a habit that I have been reading some of the letters that come to me and setting up an opportunity to connect me with the common people.
There are several types of letters, a variety of people write to me.
I feel it is important to share with you a letter that I have read a few days ago.
Therefore, under the Mudra Yojana, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some products from the market.
In the meanwhile, the Government of India has taken note of the Government e-Marketplace and Government e-Marketplace.
Anyone who wants to give something to the government - electric bulbs, dustbins, socks, chairs, tables, can register themselves on this platform.
And the government departments have been forced to go to this site and buy goods by considering who is paying cheap and quality goods.
In this regard, all the departments of the government are taking note of who is registered in the E-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at cheap prices.
This is an opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
It also has an insignificance, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I want all those who want to sell their products to the government to register themselves on this website in a big way.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space sciences also keep us impatient.
India's greatest specialty is that while our footsteps are lying on the ground connected with Yoga, we are realizing the dream of touching the far-flung application.
In the past, India has achieved a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is seeking its success not only on Earth but also on App.
ISRO has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 satellites two days ago.
Besides India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US.
The Nano Satellite Mission of India will be of immense help in the field of agriculture and information related to natural calamities.
It is an important milestone in our scientific journey of 1000 days.
Nowadays, we can see that our youngsters are making great strides in sports.
Apart from education, they feel that they have a future in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements are making the country proud.
Recently, India's badminton sportsperson, Kidambi Srikanth, has made the country proud by winning the Indonesia Open Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his teachings for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a big role in overall governance.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children are engaged in sports in our family too, we should give them an opportunity.
They should not be excluded from the ground, locked in the room and insisted on studying.
Let him study, and make his progress: but if he have more talent and interest in sports, let him be encouraged by all that are in school, college, family, and neighborhood.
Everyone has to dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the period of rainy season and continuous celebrations has been a period of creation of new experiences in a way.
Once again my best wishes to all of you and I join you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
This summer is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rain.
Today, on the occasion of my interaction with you, the holy month of Ramallan has started.
On this auspicious month of Ramlan, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
Significant significance has been given to prayers, spirituality and devotion in the month of Ramlan.
It is a matter of pride for 125 crore people of our country that all religions of the world are present in India.
We must be fortunate that our ancestors have established this great heritage.
There are people who believe in God, those who deny God in this country, those who worship the idol, those who oppose the worship of the idol - this is our country full of diversities.
The art of living in harmony with diverse ideas, diverse ways of worship and diverse traditions is integral to our spirit.
Whether it be religions, methods, philosophy or traditions, we all have the same message - peace, unity, harmony and harmony.
In this holy month of Ramlan, we will be able to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a large number of people have registered their books.
Everyone wants to share with me with enthusiasm about their experiences personally.
"I speak to Dilksha Khad.
I decided to study on vacations as the habit of reading is almost free from me.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I felt that how many sacrifices and struggles had to be carried out for India's independence and how many martyrs had experienced prison atrocities.
I urge you people to give a message to the generations of today about this thing that has inspired me to be the greatest achievement at the age of very young.
I am glad that the younger community is keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters, about the sacrifices made by the spirit, physical and spirit for this country.
Innumerable men have lost their youth in prisons.
Many young people are still kissing ropes.
Today, we can breathe the breath of a free India because they have experienced all the hardships they had said.
All the gentlemen who spent their lives during the freedom struggle wrote books, reads and performed great tasks. Their writings also contributed a lot to India's independence.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book Maji Janmade in prison.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Do you know how many atrocities the freedom fighters have beared
When I had to read the book, I wanted to see the Cellular Jail.
There they organize a television show, which is very inspiring.
Those who sacrificed their youth in this Andaman Nicobar Prison, known as Kalabani, belonged to all the States, all the language speakers of India and had suffered a lot.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
Well, what do you mean to connect with nature
As far as I am concerned, we have to connect with us.
To connect with nature, to create a better planet.
Who can express this better than Gandhiji
Gandhiji once said - One must care about a world one will not see that it is our duty to take care of the world we cannot see.
You might have experienced that nature has my power.
Perhaps you might have been feeling very tired and if you pour water and sprinkle it on your face then think about what kind of freshness you have received.
The famine that has created our body, when it is connected to the famine, new energy emerges.
Therefore, this is the worldwide movement that will connect with nature on the 5th of June that we have to connect with us.
The Vedas have shown the Earth and the environment as the basis of power.
The Atharvana Veda gives us a holistic guidance on the environment, a book that is thousands of years old.
: - Mother Earth: Budro Ahmad Prithviya is a case in our country.
It has been said in the Vedas that the cleanliness that we have is due to the Earth.
Whatever be the festivals in our country, the multiple worshipping systems - the illiterate, the urban-ruralized, the tribal community, the nature worship and love for nature is a natural lifestyle.
However, we need to understand this in contemporary terms, with contemporary ideas.
I have a lot of news from the states.
With the shower of rains in almost all the states, a big drive for planting begins.
Millions of trees are being planted.
We also need to contribute this time to the work of planting during this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, the 21st of June is a worldwide identification day.
As World Yoga Day, everyone in the world celebrates it.
The 21st of June is a short-term World Yoga Day which connects the people of the world to the coast of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist forces in the world are showing their worst faces, India's biggest gift to the world is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with one another.
Just as yoga connects the body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga can connect the world.
Today, due to the lifestyle, due to the increasing responsibilities due to emergency, life has become very strained due to pressure.
We have seen this situation in our childhood too.
Yoga will help us to lead a stress-free life in the age of taking unacceptable medicines and passing days.
Yoga is a source of guarantee for both well-being and fitness.
Yoga is not just an exercise.
If we want to enjoy such an inclusive journey through physical, mental, mental and habits, then it is possible only through yoga.
Two days ago, on the occasion of Yoga Day, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year I had announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Gradually, the work is progressing in this direction.
I have been advised to convey my best wishes to him for this basic suggestion.
This is a very interesting thing.
On the 3rd International Yoga Day, three generations of the family will come together to practice Yoga.
Grandfather's grandfather, father-in-law and son-in-law have 3 generations of yoga practitioners.
Yesterday, it will be a refreshing combination of Yoga tomorrow and a new dimension for Yoga.
Yesterday, this will be tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
As the International Yoga Day is still three weeks old, start training from today itself.
For your part, share the topics related to yoga, spread and connect people.
In a way, it is a healthcare movement that will preserve it.
I invite all of you to join this event.
From that time onwards, I have been touring various parts of India.
I have noticed that some people have noticed what Modi has done.
An interesting telephone call came to me, and I didn't think of it.
But I am grateful for this kind of different perspective.
I hope this telephone call will make you feel like that.
"Modi ji, I speak from Mumbai to Naina.
I often see Modiji wherever you are going, people there pay more attention to cleanliness in television and social media.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, the people are engaging in the society as a movement of cleanliness by listening to your invitation.
On the one hand, there is also awareness about cleanliness among children.
I have often seen their elders betray the dirt on the streets.
After you have started a cleanliness drive in the fields of Kashi, you have been inspired by it and it has become a mass movement.
You are right, wherever I go, the government machinery performs cleanliness but nowadays cleanliness is being celebrated even at the community level.
A substantial amount of cleaning is being done 5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I leave.
A few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
A massive cleanliness drive took place there.
I didn't see it attached, but this phone call came to me and yes, this thing was right for myself.
It is a matter of great pleasure that all other preparations are being made by the Muslims to welcome the Prime Minister, but it is impossible to give importance to cleanliness.
It is a joy to everyone who wants cleanliness and it is a compassionate thing.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have strengthened the cause of cleanliness.
Someone has given me a suggestion.
It's funny as it is.
Whatever the idea is good, I have to think about it.
Whatever a movement is required is better than a gift, it is better to remove so many tons of garbage.
The Government of India, with the help of State Governments, has decided to launch a massive massive movement on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On the 5th of June, World Environment Day, about 4000 cities in the country will have access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of dustbins are to be provided, one green, the other blue.
Two types of waste materials are emitted - one liquid waste, the other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulation, in 4000 cities, these dumps are going to be placed, the dry waste should be placed on a blue lash and the liquid waste should be placed on a green waste.
In cooking wastes such as vegetables, the remaining meals, eggs, leaflets of trees etc. all should be placed on the green waste.
If we remember the colourful greenery of the fields then we will recall what to put on the green dustbins.
The second type of waste is that it includes paper wastes, cardboards, iron ore, glass pieces, plastic, polythene, broken pockets, rubber products, metals, all these should be put in the dry dump and recycled in the machines.
A few days ago, a thing fell into the ear and Versova Beach, which is considered to be a dirty beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this purpose, Afroz Shah conferred the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on him a grand award.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth award.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days and months, there have been articles in newspapers, TV channels and social media about the three years of the present government, discussions and analysis.
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
Integrated research has been carried out, with a large number of opinion polls.
I see these as very healthy symptoms.
During the last three years, it has been seen in every lecture.
People at all levels of society have studied it.
This is an excellent function in the democratic system.
My obvious, hypocritical conception that the governments are obliged to respond to the democracy must be dedicated to the people of the princely states for their work.
I express my gratitude to all those who have spent their time exploring our work in depth, analysing our work, advising, supporting and expressing grievances.
I also express my gratitude to all those who have made important meetings in mind.
Whatever crimes are there, it is only when they are revealed that there is a possibility of reform.
Perhaps the work could be good, the lesser benefits could be scared, the worse, the lesser ones should learn from them.
Positive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This discourse and research is very important for an awakened nation and a rational nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you, as a common citizen, everything is bad as an ordinary citizen.
Some people see the voice of Mann Ki Baat as a party conversation, some criticize it from the political perspective, but after a long experience, I don't even think that Mann Ki Baat programme will change me as a member of every family of India.
I feel like sitting in the house in the middle of a family and talking about household matters.
I bow to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, all those who are in so many high positions have given importance to the voice of Mann Ki Baat by giving away their golden time.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
Some of our friends used to talk to me while working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I am indebted to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, when we meet next time, there will be rainy season in all parts of the country, the weather will change, the results of the exams will be learning again.
Come, let us all come together to love nature and move forward in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Every time so many efficient inclusions come to mind, detailed analysis is being carried out on the government side.
What kind of complaints
We can generally see that advisory is the nature of human beings.
When we travel in trains and buses, if someone coughs then it is natural for us to advise someone to do this.
Initially, when Mann Ki Baat was advised, there were suggestions and suggestions that were a habit for many of us, but when we tried to approach it, I was indeed in a very happy flood.
After I mentioned that in the Narendra Modi App, on MyGov web site, do you know what is being done by using innovative methods to prevent food from getting wasted from all corner of the country
I don't even think that the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this thing for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been going on for years, but the youth of my country have been engaged in this thing.
Many people have sent me video.
In many places, bread banking is being run.
People offer bread from their side, they bring vegetables and whoever needs them, they come and get them.
Nobody wants to think that those who buy and enjoy suppliers are indispensable.
This is an example of how to work with collaboration in society.
Today is the last date of April.
The foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra comes in May.
On this occasion, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of both the states.
Both the states have contributed to the progress of the nation and have been continuously working towards achieving new developmental summits.
There have been great personalities in both the states and their lives have been inspiring for us in every sphere of society.
Remembering these great men, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the states, in 2022, when it will be 75 years after Independence, we should take a pledge to raise our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the states.
We have to move forward in collaboration with all the citizens to realize that commitment.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of both these states.
At one time, climate change was a matter of being spoken only at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily lives, we are enjoying it, we are disappointed.
Nature has changed the rules of its dance.
This time we have experienced the heat in the months of May-June in our country in March-April.
While I was considering the suggestions of the people for Mann Ki Baat, more suggestions were about what we should do during the summer.
Although all things are known and not new, it is very useful to re-think them at the right time.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra, D.
In Balkani, they have said that water should be kept on the upper layers.
I have seen even small boys in the family do this thing better.
And if they consider why they have to fill water, they will leave ten times a day, and see if you are in the vessel.
Besides this, the birds shall come and drink and they shall behold the snare of sight.
This may appear to us as a sport, but in reality, the pinch has been encouraging the wonderful experience of compassion.
In our country, a musical life with birds and birds and nature is mixed with our nerves, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts at the level of society.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it took 100 years for Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of Dhaudi Bohra community.
He lived for 103 years.
To commemorate his 100 years of birth, the Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the gurus through the Burhani Foundation.
It also got a place in the Ginnas World Achievements Book.
Sometimes we are so excited that whoever comes to our doorsteps like a milkman, a vegetable seller and a postman, we forget to ask if you drink a mouth in the summer heat.
My young friends, I would like to share a few things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place and in a comfortable environment.
Mother's fathers maintain them in a very safe manner.
There are other fans, but most people are in luxury circles.
Now the examinations have been completed and you must have made plans to spend your holidays.
The summer vacation will be slightly sweet after the heat is gone.
I would like to give you three suggestions to utilise your vacations, three of them are special, but I would like to do something or the other.
Get a new experience, try and attain a new potential and decide that nobody has ever heard, nobody has ever seen, nobody has ever seen, nobody has ever known.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
The test must be positive, come out of your luxury circle.
We belong to the middle class families and have a comfortable family.
In the evening, take your cattle or basket or take other sports products and go to the nearby poor habitations.
Play with the poor children there and you will realise that you will get the pleasure that you have not yet been able to play in your lives.
When such a poor child gets the pleasure of playing with you, how big a change can be brought about in their lives
Once you go, your heart will be enjoyed to go there again.
This experience will teach you many things.
Several NGOs are engaged in service.
You should associate yourselves with the Guru of the cow and associate yourself with some organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
Sometimes summer camps will be organised, governed development camps will be organised, various constructive camps will be organised and you will be connected to them.
After participating in such camps, after you have been selected, teach the poor that you have learnt as a service free of cost and the opportunity to learn these things.
You can teach them how to do it.
Though technology is considered to be a reduction in distances and destruction of borders, the evil consequences of these are erosing my mind.
Six people are sitting in one room but cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone is immersed in technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is an energy.
Another thing I have said is about talent and don't you want to learn something new
There is also a fear that sometimes our younger generation is becoming robots.
Friends, the dreams we see higher in life are all good things.
But we should not interfere with the human elements within us, it should be careful that we do not leave our humanity behind.
Can we not focus on skill development
We are trying to spend time with us just a little away from technology.
If you don't know the swimming, you can learn swimming, you can learn the painting, you can't get the best drawings, but the paper is a silver potter.
The feelings within you will start reflecting in it.
You will feel that all these capabilities and these activities will not only give you happiness but also the bindings that you have tied on one side.
Do something different, friends
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
If you think that after all the exams have been completed, after you have come to a new level in your business, you would have got the opportunity to know that I had learnt all this.
That is why I want to tell you that there is a Magic Learning Country, you can learn the Magic Magic.
Please do this to your friends.
If you don't know anything, try to learn it, it will definitely benefit you.
Aware of the positive energies that are within you, it will provide an excellent platform for development.
Friends, I share my experience with you, we cannot imagine what we have to learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there, then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you a very good opportunity.
The new generation has almost made cash transactions.
Whatever you are involved in it, but you can also earn through this scheme, do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with this and if the new person does 3 transactions then you will get an income of 10 rupees.
In your accounts, 10 rupees will be added to the government.
If you say that you have included 20 people in this one day, in the evening, 200 rupees will be deposited in your repository.
Businessmen can also earn from this, and students can earn from it.
The project is scheduled till 14th October, 2018.
May you contribute to making Digital India.
You are the protectors of New India.
I got an interesting phone call.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I am Shiva Saubey from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to talk about the red light.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic crisis, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you for this decision taken by you people.
The government's decision to abolish red light is a systematic measure.
But we have to root out this culture that is rooted in our minds.
If we all work together with consciousness, we can overcome it.
When I say that, my aim is clear - Everi Burson Is Impartant, everyone is important.
Every person has a special significance, if we accept the significance of 125 crore people, if we realise the importance of 125 crore people then it will be a great energy to realize even the greatest dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the 125 crore Indians.
Because of some reason we were stuck on the thresholds, we were very small, we were used to think only about the centuries.
Centuries of other countries in the world are also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, how difficult it is to dismantle social conditions
How could it have been a thousand years ago
Only a few knew that Ramanujar had unleashed a massive struggle against the bitterness of society, the feeling of superiority, the inadequate, the caste.
He embraced and performed through his actions whom the society considered to be incurable.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a movement to enter their temples and successfully entered the temple.
Tomorrow, the Government of India will release a postage stamp to commemorate the commemoration of holy shrine Ramnujacharya on 1st May.
I salute the holy Lord Ramnujacharya and pay my homage to my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, there is a greater significance for the 1st of May tomorrow.
In many parts of the world, labourers observe it as a day.
While speaking of workers' day, there is talk of labour and workers, and naturally I remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions and honours being given to the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb, while talking about the holy Ramnujacharya, the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka, who lived in the 12th century, has got the opportunity to remember Jagatguru Basaveswar.
There was also an opportunity to release his pool of gold.
In the 12th century Kannada, he made a profound comment on labour and labour.
In Kannada, he has called Gaya Kave Kailas, which means that only through labour you can achieve the accomplishment of Lord Shiva i. e.
While talking about the workers, it is natural to think of them with the coconut.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha from all over the world celebrate it as a festival.
Lord Buddha's views are very relevant in view of the world's violence, war, destruction and conflict of arms.
Buddhism is an excellent example of the sacrifice of Ashoka's life in India.
This auspicious day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations as Visakhapatnam.
This year's celebration will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I have come here to pay my homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbours.
We believe that our neighbours should be composed and they should move forward.
There are many possibilities.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and amenities of the satellite will provide substantial support to the economic and developmental activities in South Asia.
This is a remarkable example of our vision for South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are associated with the preparations for the selection of their children.
Today is 26th March.
It is a matter of pride for us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are the wealth of all of us.
In 1919, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre was unleashed, when Rabindranath Tagore was one of the gentlemen who raised his voice against the massacre.
The massacre had a profound impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, the British executed Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukdev and Rajguru
During the tragic incident on 23rd March, Mother India was pleased with the sacrifices made by Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru and there was no fear of death.
They blessed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three are still illustrious to all of us.
We cannot utter the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire Empire of English was dazzled by these three.
They were imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the British were worried about how to treat them.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I could feel a kind of shock on that land.
Whenever you have the opportunity to visit Punjab, I urge the youth of the country to visit the places where the statues of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Mother Bhagsingh and Pedukeshwar Dutt are located.
It was a period of freedom and its intensity.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were enthusiastic about the armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April, 1917, Gandhiji visited Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the century of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the expression of Gandhiji's thoughts and the way Gandhiji's teachings were made in the freedom struggle of India.
This was a turning point in the journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
It was the period of the beginning of the deep impact of Gandhiji's thoughts and methods on Champaran Satyagrah, Keda Satyagrah and the Mill Workers Strike in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new impetus to the country.
Today, we cannot estimate the Champaran Satyagraha in our minds with regard to Gandhiji.
Just imagine, a man who returned to India in 1915, experienced only two years.
He highlighted the magnificent potential of Gandhijis coordination through Champaran Satyagraha, the power to know the pulse of the Indian society, the power to inspire the poorest and the illiterate masses against the British and bring them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him what kind of hard work Gandhiji had to work for the welfare of the people.
The great leaders of that period like Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani used to go to the village of Gandhiji.
He taught people how to connect their work with the freedom struggle.
Today we are traveling in the 21st century, who doesnt want to change India in today's era, who doesnt want to take part in the transformation of any Indian
This desire of 125 crore countrymen and their efforts for transformation will be a strong foundation for the creation of a New India.
New India is not a government scheme.
New India is the challenge of 125 crore people.
This is the feeling that 125 crore Indians should come together to build a New India.
This is a desire, a desire, a feeling, a feeling, a thirst that is deepening the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
Peacefully, they are engaged in this kind of work, like those who have done the rituals.
Many people go to hospital every day and help patients.
As soon as the news is needed, there are many people who donate blood on their way to Ooty.
If someone walks in hunger, there are many people who do good things to feed them.
Our country is a country full of such valueless cattle.
Peoples service is called Magazine Seva, it is all in our nervous system.
If we see it as a whole, if we look at it in an integrated manner, then it is a clear indication of the immense power it is.
When we talk about New India, it is a natural thing to raise criticism of this idea that it can be accepted in a democratic way.
But if the 125 crore Indians have made a solemn pledge, if they decide their path, if they have started taking steps one after the other then the dream of 125 crore Indians is cooking a New India.
It is not necessary that all matters should be included in the budget or the government scheme or to be spent on government money.
I would like to say that every citizen of the country should do his duties as a citizen and should realise his responsibilities.
Why shouldn't we regulate this journey that will enable us to eradicate our autonomy
I invite you to come and participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in Digital Payments Digital movement.
After demonetisation, there is a lot of progress in the digital payment system.
Since we started the BHIM App for only 2-3 months, nearly 4.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore countrymen make a solemn pledge of digital transactions worth Rs 12 lakh crore this year
In order to implement this, we can pay the school fee digitally, we can take the ticket fee for a journey on a train or aeroplane digitally, we can buy medicines digitally, if we are a cheap food shopkeeper then we can take steps for digital payments.
In the past, several programmes have been organized for the Digital Celebrations for the awareness of the people.
There was a commitment to do 100 events across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 merchants won the awards.
Everyone is determined to take this task forward.
A massive movement has also been organised.
I am confident that we will create awareness about the BHIM App even more than possible on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to contribute to reducing cash usage.
My dear countrymen, every time you are giving me a variety of suggestions to ask you to give your suggestions for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
But I can see that in your suggestions you have always been putting too much pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through the Rispana bridge and it runs near my house.
We have tried to create awareness among the people who are travelling in the area against the pollution of the river but it has not benefitted from it.
I urge you to send a team from your side or to create awareness about this issue through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain in the minds of a student studying in class 11.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has been created since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Everyone has made a positive engagement with it.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
Hate against dirt has been increasing.
Be it awareness, creative contribution or movement, the importance of these things is sure.
Though the task is difficult, it must be done.
I am confident that this feeling that has emerged among the new generations, boys, students and youngsters of the country indicates a good sign.
Today, in the voice of my heart, all those who are listening to Gayatri's thoughts, I want to tell them that Gayatri's message must be a message to all of us.
My dear countrymen, from the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have had many suggestions about wasting food.
We all know that when we eat in our homes and in public functions, we take more food than we need in our layers.
Have we ever imagined how much destruction is caused by the remaining remains that we leave
If we don't have the rest, how many poor people will be able to feed
But the treachery shown in this regard is a great treachery against society.
This is injustice against the poor.
On the other hand, if you don't waste food, savings will benefit the family economically.
This is a good thing, it is a matter of gain when it is socially thoughtful and it is a matter of family welfare.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youngsters who are running a mobile app.
If there is more food, they will be informed that they will collect more food and share it to the needy.
Young people of our country are working for this measure of good use of food.
You can meet such people anywhere in every state of India.
Look at the ways of transformation.
They always say that those who are aware of health should keep a little less in the leaf and fill the stomach a little less.
World Health Day on 7th April.
Universal Health Coverage (UNHC) has set a target of healthcare for all by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from depression.
Teach your parents, brothers and sisters openly to the teachers and tell them what is inside you.
Have you ever thought why they are acting like that
You must understand that they are in the first stage of depression.
Personal stress, psychological and physical disorders.
Just as diabetes provides a comfortable base for all kinds of diseases, depression also thwarts all our capabilities in fighting severe situations, self-reliance and decision-making.
If you are unable to speak openly to your stakeholders, engage people with a sense of service in some place near you.
Please take full care of them, participate in their comfort and you can see your mourning disappearing automatically.
And if you try to understand the sorrow of others, and if you do it with a sense of service, then a self-confidence shall be instilled in you.
By interacting with others, by providing selfless service to others, you can easily dissolve the burden on your mind.
Similarly, Yoga is a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You can start your efforts from now on.
Make sure that lakhs of people participate socially in Yoga Day.
If you have any suggestions on the 3rd International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions and guide me through the mobile app.
You can create songs and compositions related to yoga so that people can understand it.
Today, I would like to talk to the mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about several things about health.
In the past, the government has taken a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day, their contribution is increasing, this is a welcome thing.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of April, the holy Ram Navami will be on the 9th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on the 14th of April.
May the blessings of these great personalities inspire us and give us a fillip to cooking a New India.
After spring, the crops will start growing and the farmers will get the benefits of their labour.
In many corners of our country, this new year is celebrated in many ways.
My New Year greetings to all of you.
The snow period is now disappearing.
Spring is recording its arrival in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new turtles have started blossoming in the trees, flowers flow, forests, gardens and fountains are all boiling green.
Not only flowers, but also fruits are glittering in Adhavan's carpet.
Mangani's beetles have started appearing in the spring season.
Turmeric flowers of hard cotton in the fields give confidence to the farmers.
The flowers of the flowers of the flowers of the flowers are the commemoration of the Holi festival.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change as very tasty.
Heavy crops boil everywhere in the fields, peacocks blossom, poultry blossoms, poultry bouquets bouquet, when the natural cave shines, the atmosphere becomes comfortable, and the man is still in the sweetness of this environment.
Vasantha Panchami, Mahasivaratri and Holi festivals are enjoying flowers in the life of man.
In the context of love, fraternity and humanity, we are preparing to conclude the month of Participation and welcome the month of New Church.
Spring is a combination of these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions in front of Mann Ki Baat, I first express my gratitude to millions and millions of people for sending me a lot of suggestions.
My thanks to all of you who have contributed in all respects through letters on Twitter, Facebook, on the Narendra Modi App.
In the Narendra Modi App, Shoba Jalan ji said that a lot of people don't know about the achievements of ISRO.
He further said that you must also inform about 104 satellites and intercepted missiles.
Shobaji, thank you very much for recalling the example that has made India proud.
Our scientists have built India on the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many surprising achievements over the last few years.
ISRO has made a new world record in the space sector just a few days before it was successful in sending Mangalyaan to Mars.
India has successfully launched 104 satellites from many countries at the same time.
This is a great historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space programme is one of the most surprising of the world, the whole world has praised the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is of immense significance - Cartosat 2D - a satellite of India that will help in identifying mineral resources, infrastructure, development evaluation and planning for urban development.
In particular, our new satellite Cartosat 2D will help our farmer brothers and sisters to know about all the matters related to how the number of baths in the country can be used and how to take care of them.
As soon as we have arrived, our satellite has sent a few pictures.
It has started its work.
It is a matter of great happiness for us that all these activities have been led by our young social scientists and our women scientists.
It is a matter of great pride for ISROs success that how important the contribution of young scientists and women scientists is.
On behalf of the countrymen, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists of ISRO.
You are building several new achievements every day to keep the aim of sustaining space science in mind for the public and for the nation.
Whatever appreciations our scientists and their entire team have received, they are less.
India has successfully tested a missile to intercept continental missiles in the defence sector.
This is a great achievement in the field of defence.
It will give you even greater pleasure that these technological capabilities in the world are only with four countries of the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though a missile is coming to attack India from a distance, it is capable of destroying it on our missile application.
We are happy to see new technology, some new scientific achievements.
In the world, the mind of man has been trying hard to find out the rules of creation.
New science and new technology have emerged from this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
Dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often expressed my heartfelt gratitude to our younger generation for inspiring science.
Many scientists need the country.
Today's scientists are becoming factors of a stable change in the lives of generations that are now emerging in the era.
No science jumped from heaven in full.
Gandhiji had said that all scientific achievements were achieved by experience.
Honourable Babu ji has said that the true vision should be lauded by working hard for the thirst, fortitude and sacrifice of our neo-scientists.
Scientific needs the masses to understand how the principles are synonymous with practicality and what kind of technology they use, so that it can become an important contributor to the common man.
In the last few days, NITI Aayog and the Department of External Affairs of India had organised a special competition on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
In Mumbai, in 2005, there was heavy rains, floods and ocean anger, and there was a lot of trouble.
Any natural calamity occurs, it is the doors of a poor household.
Two people decided to find a solution, they saved the house in full time and saved the households from floods and improved a house that can prevent water-related diseases.
I could see so many innovations.
I would like to say that many people have contributed to this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a technology driven society.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, more emphasis has been given on Digital.
Gradually people are shifting from cash transactions to digital payments.
In India, digital payments are growing at a rapid pace.
In particular, the younger communities are using digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
Over the last few days in our country, there has been a great reception for the schemes like Lakhi Grahak Yojana, lucky Consumer Scheme, Digital Business Yojana and Digital Business Programme.
Nearly two months have passed since 15000 people have received one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India is becoming a mass movement, and the entire nation has welcomed it.
It is a matter of great pleasure that so far, 10 lakh people have received a discount, more than 50,000 traders have received a discount, more than Rs.
Under this scheme, more than 100 traders have received one lakh rupees per year.
More than 4000 merchants have received a premium of Rs. 50,000 per day.
Farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives and students are very enthusiastic about this.
When I saw this, I came to know that not only the youth, but also the elderly, had participated, including a 15-year-old boy and a 65-70-year-old senior citizen.
Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App from Mysore and he has received 1000 rupees through the Lucky Customer Programme (Lucky Grahak Yojana).
But I would like to share with you what I think is important in his writings.
My dear countrymen, your name and your action give us joy.
You are doing a very inspiring job.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his industry after demonetisation. He has received a discount of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's lucky customer scheme.
Today, even if he is driving a car, he has become the ambassador of this project in a way.
He will also share information on digital payments with all passengers travelling in his car.
He is enthusiasticly sharing and encouraging others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, shares her experiences with her friends about how her family uses RuPay card and e-wallet.
You come to the leadership of this movement.
You take this forward, it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
In my view, all those who have joined themselves in this task are the new warriors against corruption.
In a way you are the fighters of honesty.
The biggest prize winners will be inaugurated on April 14th.
There are still about 40-45 days left.
Can you do one thing to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days back, Baba Saheb Ambedkar passed his 125th birth anniversary.
In order to commemorate his memories, you should teach at least 125 people to dedicate the BHIM App.
May the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar become a Bhim App and an important occasion
I would also like to mention this thing that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You must go home and connect everyone with it and ensure that the BHIM App is in the hands of 125 crore Indians.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last two-three months, several cities and towns have witnessed a great impact.
Friends, farming is the cornerstone of the economic system of our country.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a joyous message with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the stores.
This year there has been an unprecedented yield due to the hard work of the farmers of our country.
All indicators show that our farmer brothers and sisters have defeated the old achievements.
On seeing Mahasuka, today we are celebrating Pongal and Paisakib festival.
This year, more than 2,200 million tonnes of mahasul has been received.
This is 8 more than the last achievement of our farmers.
This is a surprising achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
There is another reason why I thank the farmers - they have also cropped a variety of pulses besides producing traditional food grains because pulses are full of proteins.
The voice of the poor has fallen in the ears of my country's peasants and they have cultivated a variety of pulses in nearly two hundred and ninety hectares of land.
This is not just production of pulses but it is a great service done by the farmers to the poor of my country.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have achieved the accomplishment of pulses by listening to my request.
Dear countrymen, in our country, through the government, through the society, through the organisations, through the movements, everybody is travelling towards cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is being aware of cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government has been making constant efforts.
During the past, a function for senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
The seminar was not held in the closed rooms of the weekend in Teluguna, but was in the process of implementing the importance of cleanliness at the grassroots.
In February 17-18, a training to eradicate toilets was started in Hyderabad.
Officials demonstrated how the toilets in 6 houses were wasted and cleaned, removed the two-to-door toilets, and how they could be reused.
They demonstrated how comfortable the toilets used in this new strategy, there is no problem, no psychological obstacles, no obstacles.
Just as we normally clean up toilets can also be cleaned.
An average double-to-door toilet for a family of 6 members - will be filled in about five years.
After this, we can easily remove waste and return it to the second hat.
How many things are highlighted in it, so much is beneficial.
Even in the government, various departments are organising frequent Swachhta related meetings every two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will jointly strengthen the Swachhta Mission.
In the second meeting of the month of March, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take forward the Swachhta Mission for the last two weeks of March.
Any citizen in our country is engaged in good work, the entire nation feels a new energy, it nurtures self-confidence.
In Rio Paralympics, we welcomed the adventures of our disabled sportspersons.
In the final match of the T20 World Cup for Visually impaired this month, India defeated Pakistan and became the world champion for the second consecutive term.
Once again I congratulate all the soldiers of the team.
The achievements of our differently abled friends in the country make us proud.
I have always believed that our brothers and sisters with disabilities are more capable, full of empathy, achievers and minds.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, the women of our country are not helpless.
They are moving ahead as a synonym, they are brightening the nation with their achievements.
Over the past few days, our women have won the silver medal in the Asian Rakbi Sevens Games.
My best wishes to all these heroes.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
In India, there should be an increase in awareness and understanding in the family and society to give importance to girl children.
Today, this is not just a government scheme.
As a social understanding, it has transformed into a movement of education for all.
Over the years, this programme has linked the people's society, it has kept this important thing in mind every corner of the country, it has changed the mindset of the people about the old habits that have been going on for decades.
It is a matter of great pleasure in the ears that there are celebrations on the news of the birth of a daughter.
In a way, positive thinking about women children is becoming a cause of social consciousness.
I have heard that due to a special drive in Tamil Nadu district, Bala Vivaham has been blocked.
So far, more than 175 dairy vehicles have been blocked.
More than 55-60,000 girls have started bank accounts in the name of Self Help Groups (Suganya Samruthi) scheme of District Administration.
According to the Convergence Model (Convergence Model) model in Bandhava district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been working to protect the girl child, to educate the girl child, to organize village councils and to ensure adoption of orphan girl children through the district administration.
In Madhya Pradesh, a movement is being organized to educate every girl child in every village under the scheme of Each Gateway.
In the state of Rajasthan, the movement of our children, our school, our movement is going on to re-school the girls who have stopped schooling and re-school their education.
I am saying that the movement of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Beti Padhao has been taking various forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
This is accompanied by new imaginations.
It is being revamped according to regional needs.
I consider this as a good sign.
When we celebrate the 8th of March as Women's Day, we must be united. Our Indian women, they dont have much energy, they dont have much energy, they all get the opportunity to talk about something in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
You have come together constructively.
I am getting a lot of things to learn from you.
Everything brings me in the minds of the poor, the conditions of the villages and the feelings of the poor.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our ancestors have made the system of climate, economic cycle and social life the best, so that there should not be any recession in society in any circumstances.
In the last few days, we have celebrated several festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival is filling itself with a new inspiration and new energy...
Sometimes he slept the mountain, sometimes he took up the task of eliminating the leaves of food, that is, we can feel an innovation in every activity.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my child is going to milk two Mohans.
One is Mohan who bears the Sudarshan Chakra and the other is Mohan who bears Sarka.
Mohn, bearing the Sudarshan Chakra, drove off the bank of the river Yamuni, went to the sea shores of Gujarat, and settled in the city of Dwarka, but Mohano, who came to the shores of the sea, came to the banks of the river and breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who bears the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellect, his duties, his ability and his thoughts in accordance with the circumstances of that period, to avoid war and to live without conflict thousands of years ago
At the same time, arqa Mohano gave a new shape to the struggle for freedom of the country, to protect human values, to empower the fundamental elements of governance, to give a new dimension to the entire world, which is still unique.
What is the importance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of smoking in the midst of all the dimensions of life
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is engaged in a big celebration.
Not only India but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the 2nd of October, 1869, at Porbandar on the seashore, today we have created an era, not an individual, in a small house called Keerti Mantra.
This has given a new dimension to the entire human history and has achieved a new dimension.
There was always a thing connected with Gandhiji, in a way it became a permanent part of his life - service, service and service.
If we had seen all his life, he used to serve the people of South African societies who were suffering from different colors.
He served for the oppressed farmers in Champaran region.
If anybody needs help at any time, the sister will help in serving.
He not only strengthened service, but also strengthened the spiritual comfort associated with service.
But at the same time, the experience of a self-sufficient enjoyment and a healthy cure is also immersed in service.
We can clearly understand this through the life of our neighbour.
For Gandhiji, individuality, society, humanity and humanity are all.
Whether it is Africa's Phoenix farm or Dalstey farm or Sabarmati Ashram or Vartha, he has always stressed on social integration in a distinctly different way everywhere.
I am sure that I have got the privilege of visiting many important places related to brotherhood and offering my homage there.
When it comes to society, there is a strength for it and in this event of Gandhi 150, there should be social expression and service.
The aim must be to have a good will, a good intention, a harmonious one, a spirit of full dedication, a spirit of service and a spirit of sustainable joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Thandi in Gujarat.
Tandi, who was known as Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a big turning point.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to my brother in Tandi.
I also urge you all to visit some place related to Mahatma Gandhi.
Many events, competitions and exhibitions are planned in the coming days.
But on this occasion, I would like to share with you a very interesting thing.
This time, in Venice Biennale, several interesting sights filled with Gandhiji's memories have been displayed at the Indian Gallery.
The part of Haripura is very interesting.
You might remember that during the Haripura Congress congress of Gujarat, the event that was chosen as the leader of Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
A very beautiful past has been observed in these art areas.
Prior to the Congress's Haripura conference in 1937-38, the then Chief Minister of Shantiniketan's Kala Bhavana called for Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibition at the conclave.
This is the work of the same Nandla Bose which is enhancing the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages adjacent to Haripura and drew paintings to showcase the rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these priceless works.
Once again, with the good wishes of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, every Indian should take a pledge.
We have to do something for the country, for the society, for something good.
This is what we can do to the palm. It can be a genuine philosophy, a philosophy.
Brothers and sisters of Mother India, for the past few years, we have been running the Swachhta Hi Seva movement for two weeks before the 2nd of October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
This movement is enthusiastic for all sections of society.
My brothers and sisters, all of them have hung a table in their shops and they have written that when the customers come out of their house, they should be brave.
This will save money and contribute to protecting the environment.
This time, on the 2nd of October, when we mark the 150th birth anniversary of our brother, on this occasion, we will dedicate to him an open defecation free India, while at the same time, the foundation for a new mass movement against wealth should be laid across the country.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every small area and every citizen of the country to bow down and bow down to the people of the country. This year, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, in a way, we should celebrate the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti with the aim of liberating our mother India from the sea.
I appeal to the private corporations to come up with a suitable elimination after so many of these things have been collected.
They can be recycled.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot earlier.
Today, I want to touch a matter of greater importance than a sumscreen gold.
Even though it was a matter written centuries ago, even today, do you know how important it is
Moods are called stone pieces.
Food has been given a lot of importance in our culture.
To what extent, we have made scientific even the knowledge of food.
A balanced, nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and infants, because these are the future foundations of our society.
Poshan Abhiyan, i.e., under the Nutrition Mission, nutrition is becoming a mass movement in modern ways across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a thing was brought to my notice.
In Nasik, there was a massive movement of paddy grains.
During the harvest days, Anganwadi sisters are collecting a handful of grains from the people.
These cereals are used for hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is done when the baby is first fed with solid food.
Not liquid food, solid food.
This is an excellent effort and it can be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people are organising a movement called Didi Bhojanam.
The family members prepare a nutritious diet, prepare a tasty diet, go to Anganwadi, go to schools, and all the family members of the family are commuting and feeding themselves.
They share their happiness and when they share that happiness, they dont diminish.
Enjoyment with the spirit of service is a wonderful association.
Friends, we can intensify a strong war against malnutrition in our country through such small things.
Today, due to lack of awareness, the poor and the self-sufficient, both are suffering from malnutrition.
We will celebrate September as a nutrition movement all over the country.
You must associate yourself with this and get information and add new ideas to it.
If you bring out one or two persons from malnutrition, then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of confidence that some questions would be asked about this matter.
Moreover, for the past few weeks, wherever I went, whenever I met the people, I was talking about Man Vs Wild.
I have never imagined that I would get such an opportunity to get a place in the minds of the youth of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
As Prime Minister, whenever I have the opportunity to visit wherever I have the opportunity to visit, how the situation has become due to International Day of Yoga, whoever sits in the world, whoever sits in the world, he starts asking me about Yoga for 5-6 minutes.
Until now, I have become the leader of the world about Yoga, which has been my experience all over the world.
But nowadays there is a new experience.
Whoever I meet, whenever I get the opportunity to meet, they talk about wildlife related issues, they are discussing environmental issues.
165 countries are planning to telecast this programme in their language.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me a thing with a bit of embarrassment, Modiji, you are speaking in Hindi, Bear Grylls don't know Hindi, how could you talk so fast
Has this been subsequently compiled
Look, there is no secret in this.
The reality is that the technology to interact with Bear Grylls was thoroughly used.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing with me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places connected with nature and forest creatures.
I had told you earlier and I would like to reiterate that you must go to the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is huge.
Your thoughts are widespread.
I have had the privilege of releasing the census of the wildlife in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The number of LTTEs in India is 2967.
A few years ago, half of it was their number.
The Tiger Summit was held in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia.
Concerned about the declining number of tigers in the world, finally confirmed.
The commitment is to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is a New India, because of which we are achieving targets at a rapid pace, we have doubled the number of LTTEs in 2019 itself.
India has not only increased the number of tigers but has also increased the number of protected areas and social coverage.
When I published data on the LTTE, I was reminded of the lions in the Keer forests of Gujarat.
When I was in charge of being the Chief Minister, the lions' habitats were decreasing in Keer forests.
Their numbers were also declining.
We took one step after another in the Keer forests.
In 2007, we decided to place women police in charge there.
We have taken steps to boost tourism.
Whenever we talk about natural and forest creatures, we only talk about conservation.
Therefore, it is necessary that we not only protect our forests, vegetation, forest creatures, but also create a proper environment for them to live in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Vivekananda on the eleventh of September, 1893
This young saint of India, who has raised the human society around the world, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slave that the world saw of India, the same world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on the 11th of September, 1893.
Come, let us try to reside in whatever form of Swami Vivekanand Ji had seen in India, whatever power Swami Vivekanand Ji had seen in India.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move ahead with confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 29th August as National Sports Day.
It will be a very interesting movement for all of you, children, adults, youth and women.
But today I am not going to say anything about their nuances.
I would like to create awareness about fitness in your hearts, for a solid India, for our nation, we will collectively set a few goals.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of these things, we will be able to shout about it on social media platforms, outside our homes and outside our homes.
Thanks a lot.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated the corner of the country with enthusiasm and joy.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the obligations of the citizens, the duties and the urge that we have on the democratic system, is in a way a cultural enthusiast and awakens the future generations by creating awareness about democratic responsibilities.
However, the widespread and deeper debate over the duties and rights of the citizens in our country has not yet taken place.
Tomorrow, the 30th of January, is the death anniversary of our motherland.
At 11 a.m. on 30th January, we will observe 2 minute silence and pay our homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
It is our unwavering nature to pay our obeisance as a society and as a nation, for two minutes in the morning of January 30, 2019.
It's not only two minutes but it has a social character, a sense of depression and an expression of our concern for the martyrs.
We have expressed our natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I convey my best wishes to the warriors and their relatives who have been honoured with various medals on the occasion of the Republic Day.
These medals include Keerthi Chakram, Shaurya Chakram, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially urge the youth that you can do a job as you are working on social bases.
Search for the soldiers who have been honoured this time and write two good words on the website and share them with your friends.
When we are deeply aware of the adventure, valour and might of these soldiers, we shall be astonished, proud and inspired.
While we were excited and happy by the news on 26th January, some of our soldiers who were engaged in the security of our country in Kachmeer on the other hand had died due to the iceberg.
I salute all the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously shouting the voices of Mann Ki Baat.
The four months - January, February, March and April - have been a challenging month for each family.
Even though there is a choice for a child in the house, the entire family is drowned in the burden of examinations.
I always feel like coming out of this situation, so today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such a situation happy.
I know that despite creating this question, all of you have this question in your minds.
The choices must be a joyous occasion.
For most people, the time of choice is a stressful period.
You have to decide whether you consider it as a time of joy or not, whether you feel it for a period of pressure.
Those who think for a stressful period, they feel sad - pleasure for pressure.
Therefore, my view is that you should take the election time as a festival and a festival.
Whenever there is a festival or a festival, the speciality that is within us is evident.
The entire family must function as a group and enthusiastically contribute to the success of this festival.
When you look at it, there will be a change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kach to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, this is the only choice in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to embrace each and every one of us in their own ways, to embrace our traditions and to embrace our family environment for these 3-4 months.
If you say that you were happy, if you were face to face with humor, you would feel faith, and in this situation, many years old things too will be easily shattered in your memories.
What the teacher had said in the classroom a year ago will clearly brighten your mindset.
Scinna Shakti will be stagnant and it will start to dream of as a burden.
I can experience this thing and I can tell you that if we are mentally retarded, if we forget things and if we were faithful then we cannot imagine how many useful things would suddenly come to mind.
You don't have information or you don't work hard.
But whenever there is pressure, your wisdom and your information will sink away and pressure will ride on you.
That's why a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet, I would say, a joyous mind is the key to high marks.
Sometimes I have to say that we don't approach the exams properly.
This is not a speech for your life.
What kind of life you live in, what kind of life you live in, what kind of life you want to live.
J.
Abdul Kalam is a great example of compassion for all of us.
He went to the air force and failed.
Marks have become more important.
This has led to an increase in potatoes and a huge pressure on the minds of the students.
In this situation, I would like to know your ideas about the contemporary course of education and its future.
If you believe in these things, the marks will be buried behind you like the windstorm
It is necessary to know what is the state of my knowledge till yesterday and where I have reached today.
If you talk about the world of sports, it will be instantly recorded in mind, then I have given this example.
Most of the successes take place in their lives because sportspersons compete with them.
You will take care of the life of Sachin Tendulkar
He has been defeating many achievements for 20 years and has achieved a new record by repeating his previous achievements.
His journey of life is very wonderful because he himself has been following the path of making challenges by competing with others.
Friends, in every sphere of life you will have to write your exams and will you be able to study for 3 hours when you have to study for 2 hours
How many hours did you decide to wake up earlier in the morning and it may have been delayed, but can you get up when you decide
Therefore, I urge you to compete with others and challenge yourself.
What was my earlier activity and how I moved ahead and how to work better should be careful.
With this vision, if you approach, you will be able to understand the changes in you.
S.
Sundar ji, you're absolutely right.
Even today, you might have noticed that those who ask me questions, those who give me suggestions, there are more women in them.
Because when we look at how mothers are aware of the future of children in homes and are working positively, we know that they make many things easier.
With the capabilities that you have, you should act as a guide, whatever your jobs you have, give up your time.
Once you have a habit of accepting, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are the cornerstone of their problems.
Acceptance of what exists is a means of resolving problems.
Expectations make the path even more difficult.
You'll be comfortable loading.
In a way we go to see the patient and create fears about the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that sometimes we also create such fear among our children.
Have you ever emerged to create a happy atmosphere during the election day
You will see that the environment changes completely.
I got an amazing phone call.
He didn't want to mention his name.
If you ask why he doesn't want to mention his name, you will understand.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of one thing that I have done in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of being afflicted, the thirst for learning in life will fade away.
A telephone call came, "Look, Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I want to ask you two questions about my exams as I am studying in class 12.
It is a common belief that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of focus on education.
This is a fundamental mistake, and this is the root of the problem.
If you ask for complete development, there is a life beyond singers, which is very vast.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it is 5 minutes or not, please take a little rest.
You can feel that your work is not difficult.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but this is my experience.
While addressing the dais during the elections, my voice may sometimes refuse to cooperate.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you sleep.
So far, I have not even thought of a connection between my sleep, my speech and my voice, he gave me basic treatment.
If we understand the significance of such fundamentals then we will get many benefits.
Don't do that, otherwise your family is going to be angry with me.
If you don't see the day your marks come, I'll be right in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
It is a great milestone in keeping the mind, intelligence and body strong.
Well, young friends, while you are engaged in the preparation for your exams, I am talking about something perhaps what I have said today may be a relief for you.
But I also urge you not to be burdened with what I have said.
If you can, don't do it if you don't.
Remember the resolution you have taken, trust you, go to the polls and my best wishes to you all.
Change that challenge as a celebration before facing every challenge.
Then there will be no challenge.
Keep this mantra in mind and go ahead.
My dear countrymen, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their contribution to the nation.
It is a matter of pride for us that our coast guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is 4 of the worlds largest coast guards.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is Vayam Raksham.
Coast Guards have been awake at night in adverse conditions to protect the shores and shores of the country by advancing their objectives.
Many people don't know that not only men are there in the coastal guard of our country but women are also successfully performing their duties on the shoulders and shoulders.
Our women officers of Coast Guard are either pilots or observers and are driving Hower Grab.
As the Coast Guard has become the worlds biggest issue today, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes on the 40th anniversary of the ongoing Indian Coast Guard.
In our country, Vasant Panami is a big festival for Saraswati Puja.
This is regarded as an opportunity to appreciate education.
Not only that, it is a time to inspire the soldiers.
Mara Range de Basanti Chola, let me be a spring spring splendor - this is an inspiring idea.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani has always given new colours in new alphabets and new colours in accordance with his creative potential.
Immediately after the completion of my Mann Ki Baat in the last two months, they are broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in the state languages.
This is a reception.
I have a great opportunity to travel with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Greetings on the occasion.
My dear countrymen, greetings and good wishes to you all on Christmas Day.
Today, the value of service, sacrifice and compassion should be greater in our lives.
Many wealthy people came and gave wealth.
In the end, a poor widow came and threw two buffaloes.
Today, on their birthday, let us pay our emotional tributes.
Just two days ago, I had the good opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in Varanasi, the land of Malavia.
I laid the foundation stone of the prestigious Madan Mohan Malavia Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre will be a boon not only for the people of eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country will not forget their contribution.
Under his leadership, we also took pride in the field of nuclear energy.
As a party leader, as a parliamentarian, as a minister or prime minister, Atal jis extraordinary contribution has made him an example.
Today, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to him for his good health.
As a worker, I had a great deal to work with Atal Ji.
His memories are green in front of my thoughts.
Today, the honorable Christmas, the people of the country are getting the benefits of two schemes as gifts.
In a way, both of these could be the beginning of new schemes.
Whether it is villages, cities, educators, sportspersons or cashless transactions, we can see that there is an urge to know about how to do cashless business and how to buy non-cash products.
Everyone wants to learn from each other the ways in this regard.
Digithan Business Programme (DBP), which has been set up to motivate traders, will receive awards on 25th December as Christmas Prize for 15000 individuals
The project is scheduled for 100 days starting today.
Every day 15,000 people get a thousand rupees per thousand rupees.
Digi's own business plan is mainly for businessmen.
Let the business of the merchants also be great, and a great opportunity to take away the dimensions.
The scheme is designed to focus all sections of society, especially the poor and the lower middle class
Those who buy goods worth 50 rupees to 3000 rupees will get the benefit.
This is not for those who buy more than 3000 rupees.
Even the underprivileged can use USSD, feature phone and simple phone to buy, sell and pay, and all of them will be benefitted from this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 crore cards are of poor families and people of their accounts.
These 30 crore people will be able to participate immediately in this award.
I am sure that the countrymen will be able to embrace this method and they will be eager to obtain the necessary information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see the rapid spread of awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to pay electronically and how to pay online money.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
Businessmen know very well how big this resolution is.
Those traders who make digital transactions, who are paying online payments instead of cash in their business, have been given income tax concessions.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu has formed a committee headed by him and is reviewing several schemes.
At the same time, governments have also started several schemes in their own way and are implementing them.
I have been told that the State Government of Assam has announced that 10 tax exemption will be given to Digital Payments Tax and Business License.
If the branches of Rural Banks, with their 75 account holders, make at least two digital transactions from January to March, the government will pay a sum of Rs. 50,000.
The Committee has announced that in March 2017, 100 Digital Payments (DDP) will be provided to the villages which have achieved 100 digital turnover by 31st March, 2017 as the best panchayat for Digi Money Transfer (Dighi).
Several organisations have been working successfully to take forward the digital transactions for rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that this year's 27 percent sales have increased compared to last year's GNFC's fertilizer sales.
80 rupees in place of 100 rupees and 50 rupees in place of 80 rupees and deprived of insurance and health facilities.
But money is now being paid in cashless ways.
Our country is a youth-dominated country.
Technology is the art of our hands.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all countries in this field.
Our youth have made substantial progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for a digital film.
Our youth should incorporate new ideas, innovative technologies and innovative ways to strengthen this sector.
At the same time, we have to associate ourselves with full force with the movement to get rid of black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I would like to appeal to you in front of Mann Ki Baat every month to give your suggestions and to show you your thoughts.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters have been concentrated on MyGov and the narendramodi app, of which 80-90 percent are related to corruption and black money elimination and currency deregulation.
After seeing all these things, I feel that these can be classified in three ways in general.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties being faced by the citizens due to this demonetisation.
Otherwise, they had mentioned about how the poets have adopted new methods of sedition and irregularity in many places as the work is being done for the welfare of the country and so many sacred tasks are being done.
I thank you, my people, for writing to me so many letters.
"This is a commendable way in which the money has been brought under control.
Though it is true that all of us citizens are facing difficulties, we are all on the verge of fighting against corruption.
We are fighting against corruption and black money as a war by the armed forces.'
Gurumani Keval ji has written a voice that reflects every corner of the country.
These are the factors that make real changes, the agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude not only to myself but also to those who have given a harsh response to those who are trying to take the people in a wrong direction.
Religious efforts have been made to fight the war against corruption and black money
Not only this, many people jumped on the field and used their creative work and innovation to tear off the faces of those who spread rumours and highlighted the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected with me, can there be anything that is impossible
If there are blessings of the destitute people, is it not for Essen's blessing
I express my gratitude to the people of our country, I offer my greetings to them and people are taking part in this Mahamaan against corruption and black money with full enthusiasm.
I had anticipated a detailed discussion on the ongoing war against corruption and black money in Parliament for political parties and political parties.
If there were sittings in the House, there would have been discussions about this.
It is absolutely wrong to say that political parties have been exempted in all respects.
Those who are unable to openly support corruption and black money, they are spending their entire time in looking for government grievances.
There is also a question of why they have often been changing the rules.
This government is a government that is working for the mahasirs.
The government has been making efforts to listen to the public after following their views.
When they deal with new strategies, we have to adopt new methods to defeat their evil thoughts.
In the ongoing war in the form of Vitag Khandan and Kodaikandan, a decision must be made for corruption, terrible practices and black money.
On the other hand, letters have been received from many about what kind of bad practices are being used and what kind of new methods they are using.
My heartfelt gratitude to my beloved countrymen on this occasion.
The Government has created a separate email address for sharing such information.
Besides, you can also send MyGov to the website.
The government has built a glass on its shoulders against all kinds of evils, such as the evils you indicate.
When your cooperation is not over, it is very easy to fight.
Third-class people who wrote the letter are also in large numbers.
"Mother, don't be afraid, don't be ashamed, do whatever you want to do, don't worry, but if you make a decision to travel, you don't have the right to take a decision, you don't have the right to go back.
My dear countrymen, I have said that even in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, our farming comrades have made stringent efforts despite so many difficulties and have achieved records by defeating the records of last year in the field of seeds.
From the perspective of agriculture, this is a comfortable sign.
Whether it is the worker of this country or the farmer or the youth, the hard work of all of them is getting a new dimension for the country.
Just a few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has made its name proud in many fields.
Indias progress in the world class rankings through individual indicators is a result of the continuing efforts of our skilled nations.
Indias rank has risen in the World Bank report on uninterrupted trade.
In the World Economic Forum Report on Global Competitiveness, India has climbed 32 places.
We have moved 16 places on the Global Action Index for 2016 and have moved 19 places on the World Banks Infrastructure Services Performance Index for 2016.
Several other reports indicate that India is growing at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the anger of the countrymen has been read on the parliamentary session.
There has been an outrage over parliamentary proceedings everywhere.
The President and the Vice President have openly expressed their dissatisfaction.
But even in such a situation, the mind is happy when there are some good things happening.
Even in the midst of the parliament, the country's attention has not turned out to be an excellent task.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that a bill related to the development of persons with disabilities has now been passed.
I express my gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this task and thank you on behalf of millions of persons with disabilities across the country.
This government is working towards the welfare of persons with disabilities.
Individually, I also tried to accelerate this objective.
My objective was to ensure that the persons with disabilities get their rights and dignity.
Our differently abled brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and beliefs by winning four medals in the Paralympics.
They have not only honoured the country through their success but have also made the people deep in the marvelous sea through their capabilities.
Our dear brothers and sisters with disabilities, like other citizens of the country, are our invaluable assets and invaluable energy.
After the passage of the Act for the benefit of Persons with Disabilities, employment generation for Persons with Disabilities has increased.
The definition of reservation in government services has been increased to 4 percent.
The Act provides for excellent arrangements for education, facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been set up for the persons with disabilities and you can realise the extent to which the government understands with the persons with disabilities from providing equipment to 5,80,000 sisters with disabilities at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
A new legislation has been enacted with the passion of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyangjans were classified into 7 positions, but now by passing the law, we have made it 21 and 14 new positions are being added.
For the first time, they have got the opportunity to get justice by incorporating some differently abled persons with disabilities.
For instance, we have linked Thalassemia, Parkinsons, victims, and those who are born with the skull of birth.
The Indian Cricket Team has won 4 matches in the Test against the UK.
Some youngsters have a commendable performance.
Our young man, Shri Krishan Nair, slaughtered 3 percent.
KL Rahul scored 199 runs.
Teest Captain Virat Kohli not only did a good interview but also led a good leadership.
Indian cricket team off spinner R.
Ashwin's name was announced by the International Cricket Team ICC 2016 as Cricketer of the Year and the Best Test Cricketer.
My congratulations to all of them, my best wishes to them.
In the hockey sector, after 15 years, there has been a very good news.
The junior hockey team won the World Cup.
This achievement is a comfortable sign for India's hockey future.
Last month our women women have also done well.
If the Indian women hockey team won the Asian Championship, Indias women hockey team won a bronze medal in the Asian Cup for those under the age of 18 a few days ago.
Like every year, during Diwali, I once again went to the Chinese borders to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I have celebrated Diwali on the summits of Himalayas with the ITBP, Indian Tibetan soldiers and soldiers.
I go to Deepawali every time, but the experience given by Deepawali is unlimited.
People are not only sending information but also connecting with their hearts
One narrated poems, the other drew films, the other produced cartoons, the other produced a video.
It means that every household is like soldiers' habitations.
When I saw the letters, I was astonished that how many imaginations and feelings were there in the minds of the people.
A soldier from the army had written to me: "Our soldiers, all of us, Deepawali and Holi, will be on the borders.
We will spend every moment in the thoughts of the country's security.
Yes, but in the days of the festival, there is a feeling of home.
But if you want to tell the truth, this is not the case.
On this festival, there is no doubt that we are not at home.
Sometimes we feel that we are celebrating Diwali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, during this Deepawali festival, should the spirit of brightness in the minds of the soldiers of our country disappear with a few moments
As a society, as a nation, I urge all of you to create this feeling as our nature, to mix it with our feelings, be it any festival or festival or be it a joyous occasion, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, it is certain that the strength and strength of the force will increase by 125 crore times.
Some time ago all the leaders of the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to meet me.
These are from the Panchayat Convention of Jammu Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
I had the opportunity to interact with them for a considerable time.
They used to talk about some issues related to the development of their villages, some used to come up with some demands, but when the conversation began to length, it was natural that the environment of the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children were very different.
The way these leaders of the village spoke with love and open hearts was heart touching.
During the talks, when we talked about the burnt schools in Kashmir, I realized that the same kind of misery that has happened to our countrymen, the same kind of misery has happened to the leaders of these villages.
They thought that schools were not burnt, and the future of the children was made furious.
After you return to your cities, I urge you to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am extremely happy that all these leaders from the Kashmir Valley have done a very good job for me.
They went to the villages and spread awareness among the distant.
A few days ago, during the board examinations, 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of student students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu Kashmir are committed to a prosperous future, to achieving new heights of development through education.
I convey my best wishes to those students for their encouragement and at the same time I extend my heartfelt greetings to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the village leaders.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked people for advice on the voice of Mann Ki Baat, everyone's suggestions came only about one thing.
All of them asked me to speak in detail about 500, 1000 rupees notes.
In my address to the people of the country at 8:00 pm on 8th November, I talked about the commencement of a transformative gathering in the country.
Whenever I had taken this resolution before you, I had publicly said that this decision was not simple, it was complicated.
But the more important the resolution is to implement it.
I am sure that a variety of innovations can be faced in our average life.
Even then, this decision was very big and I had said that it would be 50 days to come back from its impact and only then can we take steps to normalcy.
It will not be easy to get rid of all the diseases that we have been carrying for 70 years.
I can understand all the difficulties you face.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a large country, such a large number of notes, millions and millions of notes, such a resolution - the entire world is taking care of it, every economist is enjoying it and evaluating it.
India has a remarkable faith in 125 crore Indians and 125 crore Indians are determined to achieve the goal of their dedication.
All sections of the Central Government, State Governments and Regional Local Bodies across the country, 1 lakh 30000 bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than 1 lakh bank agents and overnight bankers participated in this work with dedication.
In the midst of a variety of pressures, all of them are very quiet and fully involved in this thing, considering the work of this country as a hub, as an attempt to bring about a massive change.
As a result, it is clear that India will succeed in this task.
I see that despite all these difficulties, all of them work in banks and post offices.
When it comes to humanity, they are only travelling a little more.
One person told me that the accident had happened to an old man in the place of Khandwa.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad to know that when the bank servants there were taken care of this thing, he went to the old man's house and collected money and did not get any hurdle in the treatment.
Several such unaccounted events take place every day on TV, in the media, in newspapers, in conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades working in this great hub and contributing.
But if the evil is so widespread, even today, evil practices have become a habit.
Even now, they are contemplating to find a way out of this black money, uncounted money and benami money.
They have been trying to save their money by humiliating the poor, talking about their wishes or by humiliating their hearts, putting money in their accounts, buying something from them.
And I would like to tell such people today that if you dont change, if you don't change, if you don't respect the law, if you don't follow it, then the law will see what you want to do.
But please do not play with the lives of the poor.
My beloved poor should not do anything to get rid of the problem because of your sins when they come to know about the names of the poor.
A very tough law has been enacted regarding benami property, which is coming into effect, with a lot of trouble.
The government wants that there should not be any problem for our countrymen.
I live in Dhirali village of Dhirali Thaluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to those who have black money and corrupt people through notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
If this action has not been taken then every citizen of India will never have a good time.
For this I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Some things are being encouraged by the media, by the people, by the government.
There is unlimited joy and pride when the common man of my country knows what a wonderful talent is there.
It has been written that even if you have an old note, if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go back hungry and leave the food and if you have to travel on this path then you must pay the money.
People go there, eat food, and after 2-4-6 days when they travel by that route, they pay back the money.
This is the strength of my country, the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice.
During the election, I had a tea-speaking conversation and this idea spread all over the world.
People of many countries of the world have also started talking about tea-speaking.
But I was unaware that marriages would take place during this Tea interaction.
On November 17, a wedding took place in Surat with a Tea Dialogue.
In Surat, Gujarat, a woman gave only tea to those who came for her household weddings, did not participate in any other festivals, did not make any feasts, because there was a shortage of money due to currency deduction.
The marchers also considered this as a honour.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Burma are very fond of their struggle against corruption and black money through their marriage.
During Navparineet Bharath and Daksha, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you for making the wedding ceremonial even a great girl.
When such difficulties arise, people also make the solutions better.
Some people have got immediate benefits through this movement.
In the days to come, the country will be benefitted, but for some, profit is immediately settled.
When I asked about what had happened, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, on the 8th of this resolution, everyone used to run away to pay their old notes.
During the period last year, about Rs. 3000-3500 crore was collected in 47 urban units.
3000-3500 crore, where is 13,000 crore
Whether these municipalities are being funded four times or not, whether the sewerage systems are being set up for the poor or the water supply systems are being set up or the Anganwadi centres are being set up or not
There are many such examples of direct benefits to the eye.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strong pillars of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, because of this new transformation of the economy, every citizen of the country, in the midst of difficulties, is making himself healthy.
But I would like to extend my warm greetings to the farmers of my country today.
Now I was inquiring about statistics related to the sowing of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I have calculated till 20th November, sowing has increased over the corresponding period of last year.
In the midst of difficulties, farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given importance.
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives were taken to lend them loans.
Several crores of rupees were given to the poor people under the Mudra Yojana because crores of people are engaged in such small enterprises and lakhs of crores of rupees are being given the speed of business.
Today I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that you should use this opportunity to enter the digital world.
You can also download the app of the banks through your mobile phone.
Your contribution in creating a society without cash can be immense. You can leverage the entire banking activity through mobile phones to boost your business.
There are technical routes, which are safe and quick.
I only want you to give me your cooperation to make this movement a success and I am confident that you will be able to lead this change and you will be able to lead this kind of leadership.
I am confident that you will be able to leverage the entire village with this technology.
And I would like to tell my brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot of injustice.
And the wages of the paper are the same as the sum of your hands.
You will have to pay your wages in full and no one will have to share it.
You should not be tortured.
If money comes to your bank accounts, you can also buy goods through a small mobile phone in nearby stores, so that there is no need for a smartphone and now even your mobile phone is doing the job of e-wallet.
Therefore, my labouring brothers and sisters, I urge you to make your contribution in this scheme because I have made such a big decision for the poor people of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the suppressed, for the deprived, for the victims and for the benefit of them.
Today, I specially want to interact with the youth.
In India, 65 percent of the population is under 35 years of age.
I am also aware that you are contributing to taking this forward in a positive way.
Guys, you are my real soldiers, you are my true comrades.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, this is a golden opportunity to take the country towards economic peaks.
My young social friends, can you help me
App, that is, you will know what is the App, you will know what is the online banking system, you will know what is the banking system, and you will be aware of the number of ticket registrations.
These things are very simple for you and you are also using them.
But today, the immense work that the country wants to do today is a society without our dream of cash.
It is true that it is not possible to have a hundred percent cashless society.
But why shouldn't we start making India a less cash society
Once you start using this low-cash utility society, the goal of a society without cash transactions will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never disappoint me for ever because we all have the desire to change the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You will know how many opportunities are being made today to create a society without cash transactions, introduce digital banking services or introduce mobile banking services.
Each bank provides online facility.
Wallet's direct content is e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
According to Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards, which have been utilised very little, after 8th, they have become more useful and more than 300 have grown.
Like the prepaid card on the mobile phone, banks also get prepaid cards to spend money.
UPI is an excellent place to do business so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is as simple as you send information to the Wattspot.
Even a person who has no lessons today knows how to send information to Watts app and how to forward it.
Not only this, technology is very simple to the extent that a big smart phone is required for this work.
Money can be exchanged through ordinary convenience phones.
Whether it is a labourer, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller or a seller, it can be used without any difficulty.
I have put pressure on efforts to make this method easier.
All the banks are engaged in it.
Now we have abolished the extra fees for online trade and have come to an end all these taxes related to cards to strengthen the notion of a society that has no cash transactions, you might have seen this in the newspapers in the last 2-4 days.
My young friends, despite all this, it is unforgettable for the entire generation.
I would like to know that all of you are actively involved in this great task.
I am listening to all of you to the creative messages of WhatsApp, slogans, poems, poems, cartoons, new imagination and humor.
When I see the creative potential of our younger generation in the midst of the challenges, I see a fundamental creation emerges amongst you when we face such a great transformation today, just as this is the speciality of the land of India that once the Gita was born on the battlefield.
But, my dear young friends, once again I would like to say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that you and millions of youth of this country will do this work.
I assure you that you will be a part of a society without cash transactions from today.
Give up all the technology for online expenses on your mobile phone.
You must lead a society without cash transactions, a movement emanating from the net of notes, a movement that liberates the country from corruption, a movement that liberates people from black money and a movement that frees people from difficulties.
Once you have learnt how to benefit people from RuPay card, the poor will give you blessings.
Within a month, we can stand as a new Hindusthan and you can do this thing through your mobile phone
Go to 10 houses every day and join 10 houses every day.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will transform this transformation into fighters.
We will move forward in this war that frees the nation from black money and corruption.
This country has created a massive revolution.
My dear young friends, once again I urge you people to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to participate in this work at a social level and personal level in every school, college, university, national student force and nation welfare programme.
We will take this task forward.
All of us have an opportunity to serve the country with the best, this opportunity should not be wasted in the golden opportunity.
My brothers and sisters, today is the birth anniversary of one of the greatest poets of the country, Harivansh Rai Bachchan Ji, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai Ji, today, Amitabh Bachchan has given a slogan for cleanliness drive.
You might have noticed that the artist Amitabh Ji, who is very fond of this century, has taken forward the cleanliness drive with great vigour.
Harivansh Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I convey my homage to Harivansh Rai.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh Ji for joining the voice of Mann Ki Baat and leading the cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, now through the voice of Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your emotions, your letters, my gov and narendramodi App keep connecting me with you.
Now, at 11 o'clock, Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast, but in the state languages it will start immediately after completion.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is being celebrated everywhere in India with enthusiasm and zeal.
365 days and at some corner of the country, our country is celebrating a festival.
But one thing we can clearly see in all these things is that this entire journey of festivals of India, their depth, their acceptance to the people, all these are linked to a basic mantra - that is to take individuals towards society.
Festivals show responsibility for all trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Nowadays we celebrate holidays on Sunday, but you must have noticed that the people of the previous generation, be it the working class or the fishermen, have observed holidays on the days of paurnary and new moonlight.
Scientists have proved that what kind of change in the sea water during the Amavasya days and what kind of impact it has on the nature.
This also affects the human mind.
That is, in our country, the tradition of celebrating holidays, pluralism and science has survived.
Today, we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I have said before, every festival of ours is educating and giving wisdom.
This Deepawali festival also gives us the message that Damaso Ma should move from darkness to light.
This is not merely the darkness of light
The darkness of superstition, the darkness of illiteracy, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evil.
If we are able to get rid of the darkness of the individual and the darkness of the individual, which is the bitterness of the Deepavali fire, then this is the aim of spreading light on the island.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India and see whether it is a very wealthy house or a slum of the poor who donates poverty or the cleanliness drive in every family during Deepawali festival.
There is cleanliness in every corner of the house.
He will also keep his soil clean that the poor will have a soil bowl, but Deepavali has come.
Canadian Prime Minister Deepavali is sharing his film with Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister had organised a reception on the occasion of Deepawali in London to connect all communities.
We can say that there is no city in the UK that does not celebrate Diwali with great celebrations.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film with pride from all over the world in Instagram.
Well, what do you know about that film
The film is about 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament who wear Indian dresses and stand at the door of the Parliament.
All these have been done on Deepavali.
The thing I want to say is that Deepavali is a bright future and a great day to inspire all the people of the world from darkness to light.
The news of accidents, fires and premature deaths during the days of Diwali is alarming.
There is another problem - on the occasion of Deepavali, doctors are going to celebrate Deepavali with their families in large numbers.
I specifically appeal to the parents and the guardians that when the children burn the butterflies, there should be adults with them.
In our country, Deepawali is celebrated for many days.
This is not a matter of one day
Govardham Pooja, Bhai Duj and Lap Panami can be said to be that this is a long time for Karthika Poornima's brilliant festival.
At the same time, we are celebrating the festival of Deepawali and are also preparing for the Shad Puja in the Muslims.
In the eastern parts of India, the festival of Sat-Pooja is a big festival.
In a way, it is a big festival, it is celebrated for four days, but there is a special feature for it which gives a deep message to the society.
It is difficult to calculate that the Sun God gives us all and from him we reach everything directly and indirectly, it is difficult to calculate what the Sun God has given us.
This sacrifice, sacrifice and hard work of the soldiers and the security forces have been emotionally disturbed in my mind.
I would like to share one thing with the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this Diwali to the security forces.
I called on my countrymen to participate in a movement called Sandesh2Soldiers, i.e., news for the soldiers.
I would like to assure you that there is no citizen who does not have immense affection for the soldiers of the country, pride in the army and pride in the security forces.
The media has also turned this inspiration into a day of gratitude to the soldiers.
When we are in the mindset of celebrating, when we think about them then a new energy emerges in those memories too.
A message also gives multiple energy and the country has shown this thing.
And some drew images, and cast lots, and made cartoons.
I can imagine how this is a moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
So many things have been identified in Sandesh2soldiers' hashtag.
I would like to read the poems sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Sauhan.
Ashwini writes: "I celebrate the festival, I am happy, smiling, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I am smiling, all these are yours today.
I also extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani has sent a telephone call to me when there are soldiers in the native place and they are also full of soldiers.
Let us listen to what the soldiers want to say.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I would like to say Shiwani Mohan.
Their families and their wives, along with the army officers and soldiers, make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, the entire military community has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the brave soldier is seen not only on the border but at every stage of his life.
You might have heard that Himachal Pradesh has become free from the habit of open defecation.
Vikas Thakur, a small village in the Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh, belongs to Patna.
Our Armed Forces personnel visited our village on vacations.
During the village Panchayat, he visited the village where discussions were going on about the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of money.
He immediately took his cheque book and handed over a cheque of Rs. 57,000 to the head of the Panchayat, and said that those 57 houses where there are no toilets, from my side give that family a thousand rupees, build 57 toilets, keep Padhana village open defecation free.
Vikas Thakur ji has shown that he has given 1000 rupees per capita to 57 families and has given a new energy to the cleanliness drive.
This is why Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of open defecation.
I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing that has happened in Kerala too.
Immediately, the shields of the National Students Force, the beneficiaries of the national welfare programmes and engineering students came together to decide to build toilets.
The students carried all the items needed to construct toilets such as bricks, cement, and carried them on their shoulders throughout the day.
They constructed toilets in the village through their labour and these youngsters freed them from the habit of toilets in the open open open for the small village in remote forests.
That is why Kerala has become an open defecation free state.
The state of Gujarat has declared that more than 150 of all municipalities and municipalities are free from open defecation habits.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally these things are not taken into consideration.
The old plan and the new programme are also expected to be implemented and the next one will be going on.
Those households in our country where there are gas ponds, those households where there is electricity, they do not need kerosene.
However, those who are worried about the government, kerosene is being provided, gas is being provided and electricity is being obtained, the middle class is getting the opportunity to make money.
Look at a big change that will prevent black market sales, benefit the environment, save our foreign exchange and facilitate the people.
Yes, there is no doubt that the intermediaries and the non-cash will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to all of us.
His claim on every subject determines the quality of the country where to go and how to travel.
The need of the hour is to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps one after another to free them from difficulties.
Whatever our old belief, we have to get rid of the difference between male and female.
Now there are toilets for girl children in schools and toilets for children.
This is a good time for our daughters to achieve a distinct India.
Though vaccines are being applied on the government side, lakhs of children are getting rid of vaccination and are targeting diseases.
Mission Indradhanush, a vaccination drive for children who are free from vaccination, gives children the power to get rid of dangerous diseases.
We are in the 21st century but the condition of darkness in the village cannot continue. A massive movement to bring electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
After so many years of independence, how can she be healthy when a poor mother cooks food on wood and 400 cigarettes smoke in her body
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore households from smoke and we are moving on the path of success.
Small traders, small entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers and end-to-end shopkeepers are receiving interest loans from mortgage professionals.
Mudra Yojana, stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, these are successful movements that have been started to get rid of interest lenders.
Direct payment of money to the banks through Aadhaar and direct payment to the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the brokers in the lives of the owners.
We have to fulfil our affinities with the memories of humanity and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab, its pain and sorrow touched my heart. Prime Minister, Greetings, sir, I speak from the Punjab.
Sir, on 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Patel ji.
Sardar Patel had worked to unite the country throughout his life, he has succeeded in this goal and united everyone.
I don't know what else to say about the country's misfortune, it was on that day that Smt. Indira Gandhiji was assassinated.
We all know very well what happened in the country after that.
I would like to know your views on how to prevent such unfortunate events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not just a human being.
After Chanakya, a Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has done the job of consolidating the country.
Sardar Patel made efforts to unite and because of his primary objective, he was also angry with many but he was not a bit loose from the path of integrity
But on the birthday of the same ardar, thousands of ardars, thousands of families of ardars were murdered after the assassination of Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
The unleashed atrocities on ardars on the birthday of that great man, who spent his entire life in solidarity, pains all of us, on the one side of history.
But even in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
India's strength is unity in diversity, in diversity, in diversity, in diversity, in diversity and in diversity.
Every generation has a duty and every government has a responsibility in search of an opportunity for unity in every corner of our country and in promoting the principle of unity.
We will also keep ourselves away from the separatist thoughts and divisive natures.
Sardar Saheb has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it a great India.
The mantra of integration is the foundation of a strong India.
The journey of Sardar ji started in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we have heard the name of Amul.
Everything in Amul is well known in India and abroad.
But only a few people know that Sardar's vision has created a cooperative union of dairy producers.
GEDA district was called GERA in those days, in 1942 he added strength to this idea, and today it is an example of how Sardar ji had worked for the welfare of farmers.
I offer my homage to Sardar ji.
On 31st October, the day of unity, wherever we may be, let us remember Sardar ji, let us resolve for unity.
My dear countrymen, in this Deepawali series, Karthika Paurnami is celebrated as a glowing festival.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis philosophy belongs to the entire human society, not only to India but to the entire human society.
This is the message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, that is service, possibilities, sarpad da Bala, that is good for all.
Peace, unity and harmony are the mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji in every respect was aimed at liberating society from separatism, superstition and evil practices.
May your dreams, your commitments be successful in all respects.
Over the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country, who have unleashed a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
My thoughts are with all the brave soldiers who have sacrificed their lives.
This cowardly event has shaken the entire nation.
There is a lot of distress and anger in the pulse of the people of the country
The loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
The entire country is experiencing this loss.
Therefore, my countrymen, I still say that I have told you that the culprits will be punished and they will not be able to escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will defeat every intrigue by their might and the 125 crore people of the country will express their utmost courage to lead a peaceful and peaceful life.
We are very proud of our army.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir are beginning to understand the enemy forces of the country.
As they start to understand the truth, they have begun to take away such destructive forces from them and travel in the path of peace.
Every mothers fathers wish that schools and colleges should start functioning at a rapid pace.
Business has also started well over the past few days.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, our path of progress and our path of development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that if we have been able to pave the way for a peaceful discussion and settlement of every issue then we will be able to provide a great way to the future generations of Kashmir.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to take certain measures to maintain law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to follow the capabilities, power, laws and regulations that we possess for law and order and ensure peaceful lives of the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from our views put forward new ideas.
Sharshvardhan, a student of class 11, has given me a distinct idea.
"After a serious terrorist attack, I felt very worried, there was a furore in my mind to do something, but I didn't know the way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of passion, at such a young age, you have thought positively and it gives me joy.
But Harsh Vardhan has a great value for the anger of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you presented a positive approach.
However, you know that during the 1965 war Lal Bahadur Shastri had led the country, this kind of feeling was felt throughout the country, it was passion and patriotic dreams.
There was a commitment to do something in every citizen's mind.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was trying to give this feeling of the country the best annually.
He gave a mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged the common people of the country to work for the country.
Every citizen must understand another attempt to express patriotism in the midst of the bomb blasts, which Lal Bahadur Shastri presented to them.
When Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, when the freedom movement was very strong, he successfully worked to give a boost to constructive work in the society when there was a need for another platform.
Let us and our armed forces fulfil our duties, let those in management take responsibility, let the people of our country and every citizen of our country contribute to this spirit of patriotism in a positive way that the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, our sportspersons who have participated in the Para Olympic Games have said in the Narendra Modi App that history is a triumph of human inspiration.
Varun Viswanathan ji has written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a great job and you must tell them in the voice of your heart.
Not only you two, but every citizen of the country has got a kind of emotional connect with the sportspersons who participated in the Para Olympics.
Crossing sports, this para olympic competition and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely changed the humanitarian outlook and the vision that we see with disabilities.
I will not forget the words after winning the medals of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women from our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, there is a greater psychology and determination than their physical strength and sporting capabilities while playing with the differently abled.
Mariappan Thangavelu has won a gold medal in their elevation competition.
Mariappan has lost his right leg at just five.
Even the poor could not restrict his depression.
He is not a resident of a big city, but a family of middle class and wealthy people.
At the age of 21, he has earned medals with hardships, with no physical discomfort, with only compassion.
While they have raised our emotions, we have also changed the perspective of seeing differently abled persons.
Can anyone imagine that the disabled can break the record of regular Olympics
This time it happened.
Abdul Latin Peak of Algeria, who is a disabled person, has won a gold medal in the 1500m Olympics.
I once again extend my heartfelt congratulations to our sportspersons and in the coming days, I will be travelling in the direction of creating a positive plan for India Para Olympics for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in the neo-state of Gujarat.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Campaign for Persons with Disabilities in which many world achievements were made.
I had to meet a young girl who had no eye sight, she was a small child from a very beautiful forest area of Nangk district, and she was sorry for the entire Ramayana.
And she showed me some part thereof, and I told it before the congregation: and the people were astonished.
I believe that the Government of India has made a world record in the neo-governance.
600 disabled persons with disabilities have been processed within eight hours.
This was included in the Ginnas World Records.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen that three world achievements are being made by the persons with disabilities in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the occasion of Gandhijis birth anniversary.
It may be remembered that cleanliness should become our nature, it should be the responsibility of every citizen, it should be seen as dirt.
Now, on the 2nd of October, I assure you that there is an awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
Similarly, everybody has been trying to take a step in the direction of cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country are moving towards cleanliness.
If the departure is correct then it has been proved that the results will be good.
Be it an ordinary citizen, be it the government offices, be it roads, buses or railway stations, be it a school or a college, be it a place of worship, be it a hospital or be it a child or adult, the poor, the farmers and the women of the village have played an important role in cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This progress is not enough, we still have to make progress.
It's very important
This is the reason that while talking about rural India, so far 2 crore 48 lakh toilets, that is, about 12 crore toilets have been constructed, and in the coming years more than 12 crore toilets have been constructed.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of open defecation will soon come to an end.
During my recent visit to Porbandar, the birth place of Gandhiji in Gujarat, officials had told me that the day of October 2, the day of ending the practice of defecation in the open space.
Come, people, we will make a pledge of progress.
My younger brothers, in particular, are using technology completely today and I would like to put forward a scheme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone number 1969 to know about the status of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in your city.
You can fully utilize it, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India urges the corporate world to come forward and make your contribution good.
Support the profession of young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
We can utilize the districts everywhere as Swachh Bharat Partners, Swachh Bharat Fellows.
If this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan stands with the governments then it cannot be progressed, it is natural that cleanliness will not be fulfilled.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleanliness drive, we have to move from waste to fertilizer.
Fertilizers have been asked to buy fertilizer from the waste.
The farmers who want to participate in organic farming should find ways to get this fertilizer.
These fertilizers should be provided to those who think of enhancing the resources of their land, who are interested in the welfare of the land, who have suffered substantial damage by chemical fertilizers, even if the requirement of this fertilizer is small.
Amitabh Bachchan has contributed to this task as a business ambassador.
All the Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are going to make deeper consultations about cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be like the finance
There are discussions on all such matters.
I am seeing new messages about cleanliness continuously.
I read in a newspaper that day that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also prepared a one-year schedule in its Ministries.
Each department should focus on cleanliness for 15 days.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and the Ministry of Rural Development are collaborating on the implementation of Swachhta Pakhwada from 1st to 15th October, 2019.
During the last two weeks of October, three more Ministries, namely, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, will be implementing Swachhta Abhiyan on their respective government borders from 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to join if you have any work related to these sectors.
You might have noticed that the Swachhta Survekshan Mission is now underway.
Initially, 73 cities were surveyed on how cleanliness was done and it was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, and now we have resided in every city and we have hoped to progress the next time.
There is a competitive environment related to cleanliness.
Every citizen of India should contribute to this movement as much as we can.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be celebrated.
It has been two years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I have been urging you to buy a little bit of paperwork.
Once again I appeal to every family to buy a carpet, so that it will light Deepawali in the houses of the poor.
On the 2nd of October, as a citizen, will we not be able to do anything related to cleanliness
I urge you to associate yourself with the cleanliness drive for 2 hours and 4 hours and share a photo of it with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With our efforts, this movement will once again get strength and a new pace throughout the country.
Recalling Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
In line with my request to dismantle gas subsidies in the past, the responses made by the countrymen are one of the most inspiring in the country's survival.
This is a movement to collect food and clothing to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers came down on the streets and took away the old sports items in the families and brought them to Anganwadi in the rural areas of the poor.
Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji had given an explanation to those political ideas which led me to the work of millions of workers like me.
Today, the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, who gave the political thoughts related to the roots of India, the philosophy of the Indian culture, the philosophy of musical political philosophy and humanitarian philosophy, begins today.
Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay, SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas, SabkaVishwas, SabkaVishwas.
Gandhiji also spoke of the interests of the marginalized.
How to bring the fruits of development to the marginalized poor
Deendayal has put forward the overall economic programme in one word, "Water for every hand, work for every land, water for every land."
The country must celebrate his birth centenary year as a good year for the poor.
The focus of society and government should be on how to bring the fruits of development to the poor.
I respectfully remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was a visionary of all of us and was an unforgettable source of thought.
How the common man of this country gives me inspiration.
What are the aspirations of the common man of this country
In my mind and mind, the record of the common man has been revealed in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for broadcasting my thoughts and taking them in all languages.
They summed up letters after the voice of Mann Ki Baat, gave advice and shouted at the doors of the government, highlighted the grievances of the government, prepared special programmes with such letters and invited representatives from the government and set up a platform for resolving the problems.
Mann Ki Baat does not stop with a 15-20 minute conversation, it is a new opportunity for social change.
What else can be a matter of greater happiness
Therefore, I thank all those who have contributed to its success, and I offer my greetings to them.
My dear countrymen, next week Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadasamy are scheduled to be held.
This is the strength of the country, the unity of society is the strength of the country.
May it be Navaratri or Durga Puja, let us think of making this Shakti Puja a means of social unity.
To take the country towards new heights, we will observe the pilgrimage of Navratri and Durga Puja with the idea of peace, unity and harmony.
We will celebrate Vijayadasamy as a victory.
This day is being celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
During the Olympic Games held in 1928, 1932 and 1936, he has done an important job of securing a gold medal for India.
At that time there were only 10 minutes to finish the show.
And Dyan Chand put three cheeks in those ten minutes, and said, I have put my cheeks in revenge for the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on mygov website or on narendramodi App.
They are varieties.
But this time I had the maximum demands for a comment on the Rio Olympics.
It makes me feel very positive when the public is so keen on the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and the pressure on the Prime Minister of India to talk about it.
Even beyond the cricket, the people of India have so much interest in other sports, so much awareness is there, so many information is available.
Chachin has written, "You must talk about Sindhu, Chakshi and Deepa Karmaar this time in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
One of these women belongs to North India, one to South India, one to East India and the other to India.
It appears that the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of making the country proud.
On the MyGov website, Shikar Tagore ji wrote that we could have worked even better in the Olympics.
My best wishes to you all for the two medals we have received in Rio.
There is a need to undertake long-term tours in sports events.
Our parents are paying attention to the lessons today.
Even now in society, they see sports with the perspective of timelessness.
We have to change this concept.
The society needs to be encouraged.
Who else can do this thing better than you
Likewise, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra has also written on the narendramodiapp - Mann Ki Baat on the need for extra-curricular activities.
In a way, the same sentiment reflected in thousands of writings.
It is true that there is no alternative to the fact that we have not been able to work as per our expectations.
We have only two medals in meditation.
However, if you don't get medals, you can see that for the first time, India's sportspersons have shown considerable talent in many respects.
Our Abhinav Bindra ji was ranked 4th in the shooting category and he lost his medal in a very small way.
Likewise, Sania Mirza-Rohan Bhopanna took place in the Dennis competition.
We have done well this time in the Athletics category.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalitha Babar has qualified for the trackfield final match.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have succeeded in getting the knock out in the hockey competition.
Vikas Krushana Yadav came to the final stages of Baxing, but he could not get a bronze medal.
Several sportspersons, for example, Adi Ashok, Tattu Pognal and Dhanush Das.
My dear countrymen, we need to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have done so far, perhaps we may have to get disappointed again.
I'm reporting the formation of a committee.
The Government of India will deeply embarrass it and consider what kind of activities are there in the world.
Action plan will be implemented on what sector we can do well.
Our programmes have to be set up with a vision of 2020, 2025, 2028.
I appeal to all the enthusiastic Indian citizens to send their suggestions to me at the narendramodi app.
Let the State Governments deliberate and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of September is Teachers Day.
I was able to learn a lot with these little boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not only the Teachers' Day but also the Education Day.
But this time I have to go to the G20 Summit and today I have felt that my feelings can be expressed in Mann Ki Baat.
The more important the mother has in her life, the more important is the place of the teacher.
We have seen teachers who are more interested than us.
They dedicate their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today, I see Gopichand as an excellent teacher crossing a sportsperson.
On Teacher's Day, I salute Bullela Gopichand Ji, his entire commitment to sports and his joy in the victory of the devil.
Teachers always realize their contribution in the lives of all of us.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's birthday
Whatever he has achieved in his life, he has always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he never dies as a student in a good teacher.
The books that he had read in that month would have been observed and cited.
He would have been examining what I've done throughout the month in his sight.
Something is still like teaching me in his classroom.
Even today, he has given me a far-reaching education.
When I see his signature at the age of 90, I wonder how he can write so many pearls in this old age
Because my signature is so bad that if someone writes beautifully then there is more respect in my mind.
You may have experienced as well as my experience.
Whatever good you have in your life by your teachers, you will say that it will be a global reflection, a honour, a change in the vision of our teachers.
It is our responsibility to increase the honour of teachers in society.
If you take photographs with your teachers, if there is any incident with your teacher, if there is a concentration related to your teacher then definitely share in the narendramodi app.
It is a matter of valuable value to look at the role of teachers in the country.
But when we talk about Vinayak Chaturthi, it is natural to recall our memories about Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
It is the legacy of Lokmanya Tilak that celebrates Veenayak Chaturthi on a social basis.
He transformed religion into a day of national consciousness through a ceremonial march and became a social cultural day.
Venkatesh Chaturthi was also discussing all the questions that touched the social life, so that a new upheaval in the society could bring about a new evolution.
Not only that, there is a mantra he has given - 'Swarajya' is our genius, it should be the focus of the struggle for freedom.
Today, not only in Maharashtra, but in the entire country there is a social celebration of Venkatesh Chaturthi.
Discussing public matters, conducting article competitions and competing in drawing the goal.
The scenes would have artistically highlighted the things that touched society.
In a way, a movement that creates awareness for all is being carried out through a socially vibrant square.
Lokamanya Tilakaraswarajam has given us the glory of our birth.
But now we are in independent India.
Come on, I'll call you.
Celebrations are the forces of society.
They provide a new life to individuals and society.
Life is not possible without celebrations, but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that this time many people have written about Venkatesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja.
They're worried about the environment.
Mr Sankara Narayana Prashant, Moti ji, has urged you not to use the Plaster of Paris sculptures to understand through Mann Ki Baat program.
He and many others have expressed their concerns, however, that the idols made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
I urge you all to use the sculptures made of clay or the idols of Durga and restore our ancient heritage.
Ganesh is the endorseer of difficulties.
In such a scenario, we should not build an idol that is embarrassing.
I don't know how you will take what I'm saying, but I don't say that, many people say that.
One of the architects of Pune, Shri Ajith Dhotbale, Nisark Mitra, Vikyan Brabodini, Nisark Kata of Vidarpa, Gyan Brabodini of Pune, Kirkawasa RA Raja of Mumbai.
Various such organizations and individuals take greater difficulty in creating idols of silken idols and propagating about them.
An unpolluted heroic square is also a social service.
There's still some time for Durga Puja.
And the houses of traditional idols shall have employment through such dust statues.
We will make a resolution that our ponds will be protected by the soil of the rivers and the environment will be protected.
It is natural that all the people of the country are proud when Mother Theresa, who has served for the poor of India, is going to be given the title of Pilgrim.
We have been blessed to learn something or the other every moment from the holy people, the sages, the saints, the saints, the great men.
We have received something from them, we are learning and understanding good things.
My dear countrymen, when progress thirst is a movement then how big it will change
Popular power is seen as a form of Mahesh Shakti.
In the last few days, the government of India in collaboration with the five state governments, in collaboration with the state governments, has been making a successful effort to clean the Ganga.
On 20th of this month, we invited the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the River Ganga to meet in Allahabad.
And there were men, and women.
I convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have done this great job.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of the five State Governments who have joined the peoples power and have taken a very important step towards the Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my heart and I have a great respect for those who create such an opportunity.
On 15th July, 1.
More than 25 lakh students socially wrote letters to their parents.
Some people in English, some in Hindi and some in Chattisgarh had written to their parents that they should have toilets in their homes.
They had demanded that toilets be constructed. Some boys didn't celebrate my birthday this year, but they didn't care, but they didn't even write that they should build toilets.
Children between the ages of seven and seventeen have done this work.
There is a 16-year-old Mallamma in the Kopal district of Karnataka, who has done a Satyagraha against her family.
He didn't do anything for himself, he didn't wear good bracelets or eat sweets
The belief of a girl child is that we need a toilet in our house.
Look at the importance of village leader Mohammad Shahi, he arranged for 18,000 rupees and built a toilet within a week.
But everyone is connected to it in some way or the other, everybody is playing a golden role.
I also appeal to the TV channels to make such short films and organize competitions.
There is no need for a big studio and a big camera to produce a film
In today's era, you can use the camera in your mobile phone to produce the film.
Our respected President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new Akashwani Maitri Channel in Golkata.
Many people may be questioned about the launch of a radio channel by the President of India.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal have a common cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and BangladeshBether Radio are beyond the borders and people speaking Bengali on both sides will be pleased to hear Akashwani.
Connecting people to people is the biggest contribution of Akashwani.
The President has launched this programme.
I also express my gratitude to the Bangladeshi people who are associated with us to fulfill this task.
I also compliment the Akashwani friends for their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, all of you may have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I too am a man like you.
So sometimes I feel sorry to touch some emotional events.
Such emotional events provide a new energy and a new consciousness that inspires the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter that came to me just a few days ago touched my heart.
A mother, about 84 years old, wrote this
If the retired teacher had not asked for his name, I would certainly have mentioned his name.
I also forgot the subsidies, and forgot about it, as you asked me to discontinue gas subsidy.
As far as I am concerned, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is like the Padma Shri award.
My dear countrymen, you must be aware that I have written a letter to all those who lost their gas subsidies, and have tried to send a letter from my side to those who gave up their subsidies.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have been distressed last year due to drought but in August this year there has been a constant flood of floods.
In some parts of the country, there was a flood again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the Local Bodies, the Social Welfare Organisations and the citizens have made efforts to make them self-reliant.
However, some actions between these tragic floods can be remembered.
It will remind us in August of this year what will be the consequence of living together and what will be the consequences when all shoulder to shoulder.
In August 2016, the opposition political parties, including 90 parties from all over the country, and so many political parties in the Parliament, have jointly passed the Goods and Services Tax Act.
Appreciations for the execution of this will be the essence of all political parties.
This is a wonderful example of what will be the benefit if all political parties travel together.
Likewise, all the political parties of the country had discussed the Kashmir issue in one voice about the situation in Kashmir.
The message to the world, the message to the separatist forces, and the understanding of the people of Kashmir.
After talking to all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing came to light and if I ask them to suppress it in two words then they are unity and love.
Both of these words became their original mantra.
Whatever deaths in Kashmir, whether it is the life of a young man or the life of a defence soldier, the loss is ours, it is ours, it is ours, it is our country's, it is our belief, the faith of 125 crore Indians, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister of the country.
One day there should be an answer to the irresponsible boys, who are prioritizing minor girls to create unrest in Kashmir.
I have faith in 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and in the days to come, I hope that the spirit of sports throughout the country will increase the enthusiasm and zeal of every young man.
We all know that in a few days, the biggest gathering of world sports events is going to take place.
The word 'Rio' is a constant resonance in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had made a grand arrangement for Run for Rio, play, live, play and grow.
In the days to come, whatever area we may be, we will do something to encourage our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The country's Prime Minister is ready to make your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all be able to honour every sportsperson in the days to come, inspire every sportsperson to his efforts.
Today, while talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet from Punjab Central University.
Like him, many other poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have composed songs for them, it may have happened in every language, but today I want to share the poem written by Suraj ji.
Let gold and silver be brass.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your emotions to all these sportspersons and I convey my best wishes to you all to fly our flag with pride from my side, from 125 crore countrymen and from Rio.
Mr.
However, whenever the name of Abdul Kalam is being taken, a future picture of a capable India of science, technology and missiles is shadowing in our eyes.
In that way, what is your government trying to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam
And if we want to compose our footsteps, then we must do research and innovation, that is the life of technology.
If research and innovation are not created, however foul smell has started in the stagnant waters, similarly technology will become a burden to us.
If we do not do research and innovation, but depend on the old technology, then we will become everlasting in a changing era
Therefore, the government has been making several efforts to sow the milk country of science, technology and the dairy of research in the minds of our younger generation.
That's why I say let us aim to innovate and aim to create innovations.
When I say AIM, it means Atal Innovation Mission.
If we want to build next generation innovators then we need to connect our students with this scheme.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such software centres are being set up in schools, Rs. 10 lakhs will be provided and another Rs.
Similar innovations are directly linked to the Camellod Incubation Centre.
If we have a powerful, incubation centre, we get a system that needs to create innovations, perform tests for start-ups and enhance them.
While it is essential to set up a new centre of innovation, it is important to strengthen the old centres.
In our daily lives, our eyes have problems.
Now we have to find technical solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have made an appeal to the younger generation of the country to take up research and innovation to solve the problems faced by you people and to provide solutions to them.
The Government of India wishes to give a special prize to the technology that has been identified to solve our problems.
When we talk about the Tinkering Lab, more than 13,000 schools have applied and when we talk about the Centre of Building, it is heartening to note that more than 4000 non-educated organisations have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that the real homage that we can pay to Abdul Kalam is research, innovation, technology solutions to the problems we face in our daily lives, and simplify our hardships.
The more our younger generation pays attention to them, the greater their role in cooking the modern India of the 21st century will be, this will be a real tribute to the memory of Abdul Kalam.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we had a feeling of famine in our hearts and now it is giving us joy of rain, while there are reports of floods.
The State Governments and the Central Government are jointly working shoulder-to-shoulder to help the flood victims.
Even if there are some difficulties due to the rains, there is an increase in the heart of every human being beyond all that because there is rain and agriculture as the central point of all our economic activities.
Occasionally, life-long diseases that make us sad also embarrass us.
But if we get awakened, if we are in a hurry then we can get rid of them and we can easily get rid of them.
Take dengue fever.
We can protect us from dengue fever.
Even though the government, hospitals, doctors, all of us are doing their jobs, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our homes, in our families and should not be cautious about any disease that is caused by water, this is what I appeal to all of you.
My dear countrymen, I would like to turn your attention towards one more issue.
If life becomes so urgent and rapid then sometimes it becomes impossible for us to think about it.
You may be relieved if you need a few moments, but you must stop the habit of taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
If a doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotics in 5 days, please complete the recommendation within the dates of the doctor.
If we leave half a minute that there is no need for health, the microorganisms will be benefited and they will be further strengthened.
In medical terms, we call it antibiotic resistance, so it is important to follow the rules that take them to the extent that antibiotics should be used.
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotic pills sold at present are drawn on the bed with a red coat of red color, it is an awakening for you.
When we talk about health, I want to add one more thing to it.
Pregnant mothers in our country are sometimes very worried about health.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country are pregnant, but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Whatever the fact that the maternal mortality rate has declined over the past decade is true, even today, we are still unable to save the lives of pregnant mothers.
In the post-delivery period, however, the problem of blood deficiency, birth-related infections and high blood pressure can prove to be beneficial for their lives.
Keeping all this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan - Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.
Can my medical brothers and sisters dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year
Many people have written to me in the past.
I am sure you will join us in this thing.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
Discussions are being held between people in the country and around the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
In the song, Lord Krishna says, 'Sarvavrukshanam' means that I am a royal tree.
It is said that there is no vegetation without medicinal properties.
An example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention, this year is my heart.
In Mahabharata's auspicious mountain, trees have been said to be performing the duties of McCatchelva even in the heavens, and Sonal has accepted the challenge not only of his parents' wishes but also of the society as a whole.
Krishi Khandu Marudi Mahadre of Narayanpur village in Junner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Several such efforts are being made.
During my tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat, during the month of Bhadra, I have seen a large number of pilgrims visiting the Amba Devi temple.
Once a social service organisation has provided a sapling to those who visit the temple and if they take it to your village then mother Amba will continue to shower their blessings on you.
Hundreds of thousands of pedestrians were also given millions of trees that year.
Temples can also start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can lead to a peoples movement related to tree activity.
I would like to once again ask my farmer brothers that instead of wasting our land by constructing fences on the borders of our farmland, why shouldn't we plant a gourd tree
Today, we have to import a single tree from abroad for manufacturing houses and chairs in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert region.
Even there, a large number of forest mahotsavs have been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small thing to say that there are 25 million trees in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan know what a big challenge it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, a resolution to increase the Greens by 50 by 2029 has been taken.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
This year, several projects have been started in Gujarat like Mamar Forest, Ekada Forest and Shahid Forest, in which several crores of trees have been planted.
As a foreign tour, multilateral agreements have been signed in various fields, such as diplomatic diplomacy, non-communicable organs, discussions on trade and defence related discussions.
But for me, South Africa's journey is a measure of a pilgrimage.
When you think about South Africa, it is natural to recall the memories of Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela.
When words like Akims, Love and Forgiveness fall into the ears in the world, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will be seen before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to go to Phoenix estate and Gandhijis residence was known as Sarvodaya.
I got the good opportunity to visit Peter Maritzburg railway station where Gandhiji had sown the seeds that made Mohantas Gandhiji a train or a train.
This time, I got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years in prisons.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire youth, and I had a great opportunity to see the great men of the great men of Nessen Mandela, Ahmad Kathada, Laloo (EEBA), Sibaji, George Besos and Ronie Casseries.
When I was talking to them, while listening to their prison experiences, there was no bitterness or bitterness in their minds.
The feeling that everyone is equal and everyone is ours is a way to lead us towards a bright future.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have lived in the original mantras of our lives even in South Africa.
Recently, I read in a news article that a woman in the fraud and fraudulent email net lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide as a result.
I am extremely sad about the condition of a woman and her family.
I would like to know what you think about such fraudulent emails.
A new strategy of using technology is spread all over the world.
The way technology is playing a very big role in the economic system, its misuse is also increasing.
At the time of retiring and finishing the marriage, it was mentioned that one day a small amount has been paid to the owner of a house, you have received a great price from abroad, if you want to get it, put 2 lakh rupees in the bank account for the customs solution.
Anybody who can make a filthy Letter Battery and send it through it, get your Credit Card number and Debit Card number and cleans your bank accounts through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should be able to save ourselves from this conflict and I would like to be awake and if such letters come to light then we should immediately share them with our friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to meet the people of our country while the Parliamentary Continuation is going on.
I had a comfortable experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar came and met me.
Encouraging the student student to flee, they brought a very large album, enjoying their faces.
They brought films that have beautifyed the Aligarh station.
They had constructed a layer garden constructed by plastic bottles at the railway station and had created a new look at the station.
If you also have the opportunity to go to Aligarh then you must go to the railway station.
I have such information about several railway stations of India that people from all over the region are enjoying their regional artworks on the walls of railway stations.
A new feeling can be felt.
This is an example of how people can transform through participation.
My congratulations to all those who have been working in this kind of work in the country, best wishes to my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country with the rainy season.
And you shall enjoy feasts in your houses, and in your publications.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Like last year, during the Raksha Bandhan period, can you give Prime Minister's Life Insurance Scheme to mothers and sisters of the country a prize of Jeevan Jyoti JeevanJyotiJi Life Insurance Scheme
My dear brothers and sisters, in your life, give us a prize that can really feel safe.
Why we might have placed a woman in our homes for cooking food or doing household chores or as a daughter of a poor mother
Whether they can be rewarded with Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti during this Raksha Bandhan festival
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after the independence of the country.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom day is not a programme of governments, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepavali, we have to celebrate this Thiruvananthapuram as our festival.
I want to do something positive with the vision of patriotism.
You can tell this thing to the people of the country and I appeal to you people to make it clear from the Red Fort.
I don't want the comments from the Red Fort to be the Prime Minister.
The red-coloured one should have a feeling of 125 crore rupees.
Many people plan on holidays for many events.
Awareness is spread in many villages
Someone told me a few days ago that the Hivre Bajar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the people of that village have emotionally approached the water problem.
There may be many villages that want to save water, but after talking to the farmers they have changed the entire cropping pattern.
They decided that the crops which are used in excess of water, whether it is black or banana, they will not be able to produce such crops.
It's easy to hear, but it's not easy.
But look at my farmer brothers and sisters, they have left immediately as soon as they want more water for sugarcane so that they do not carry sugarcane.
They cultivated fruits and vegetables throughout the country, i.e. they only cultivated what is required for a very small amount of water.
They have succeeded in their own endeavour to tackle the problem of water through various initiatives such as drip irrigation, rain water conservation and water recharge.
Well, I have spoken about a small village, Hivre Bhajar, but there may be many such villages.
I convey my best wishes to the villagers for their excellent work.
Someone told me about the Gorwa GORVA Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Latur through trains, I think it is a message to the world.
The human nature is to feel that if there is a good news from somewhere, the entire embarrassment is lost.
I feel like there has been some great pleasant news since I heard that this time there is a possibility of rainfall from 106 percent to 110 percent.
Even though it is still raining, the news of good rainfall is also refreshing.
My dear countrymen, however, the good news of the good rainfall is that it provides the opportunity and brings the challenge forward.
Whether we cannot start a village drive to save water
Farmers need soil, this helps them in farm lands.
Why shouldn't we put the soil on the lakes of the villages in the dusty fields
While the soil health of the fields will increase, the water conservation level of the reservoirs will also increase.
What if the empty cement sacks and empty fertilizer bags are filled with stones and soil and put them on the exit routes
I have always said one thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of our brother Gandhiji, we can see different places there, one of them is worth seeing.
It means that how they had constructed ponds at the bottom of the house 200 years ago to save water and how clean the water is.
His concern is very natural because the work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came and several schemes were formulated and the money was spent so that it is natural for millions of people of the country to raise such a question in the minds of crores of people like brother Kumar Krishna.
Religious people consider the Ganga as a means of providing housing to them.
Ganga itself gives us the job and it is the Ganga that gives us the power to live.
Just as the River Ganga is being constructed, the country's economic activity also gets a boost.
A bachelor brought the Ganges to us, but millions of peasants are required to protect it.
Without peoples participation, work cannot be successful. Therefore, we all have to become a change agent for cleanliness and cleanliness.
We have to tell and remind us of this thing again and again.
Several initiatives are being taken by the government.
Efforts are being made to seek full cooperation of all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to integrate social and hygienic institutions.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, hygiene and industrial pollution.
Solid wastes are mixed in large quantities every day through canals.
In the days to come, more and more people will be able to obtain the benefits of this mechanical waste disposal and the benefits of this will be immediately felt by the people living along the banks of Ganga.
I feel that this will also have good results.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsions from the plants in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in the last few days due to the ero liquid discharge i. e.
The expulsion of black liquor from paper plants has almost come to an end.
This shows us that we are traveling in the right direction and there is an increase in awareness.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung southern parts of the country, they ask us whether the Ganga will be clean or not.
It is a matter of confidence of the masses that will definitely bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are donating money to clean the Ganga.
The system is being implemented in a very excellent manner.
My dear countrymen, today is April 24th.
On April 14, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Today, on April 24, we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a good coincidence that the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, initiated the mission of Gramodhyam to Bharat Udayam for 10 days from 14th April to 24th April, in collaboration with the State Governments.
Today, on 24th April, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live, this movement has created a huge awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at all corners of India at village level
How to make villages self-reliant
How can the villages embrace their own development plans
Various programmes may have taken place in several villages of India in ten days, which may be less than that.
My best wishes to all the state governments and village leaders who have harnessed this opportunity for the betterment of villages and for the development of villages in an innovative way in the most basic ways.
This is the guarantee of India's rise.
The source of India's rise is in the village rise
Therefore, all of us are focusing on rural upliftment and we will be able to achieve the desired results.
There has been a need for development in the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has one of the primary dreams of parents then it should provide quality education to the children.
The idea of housing, vehicle etc. is after all.
This feeling in the minds of the people of a country like India is very strong.
Therefore, I appeal to all the parents to take some time to discuss the practices of schools in a detailed manner.
If something gets up in mind, go to school and ask the teachers.
This awareness must lead to the reduction in many of our educational systems and contribute to the peoples participation.
All the governments in our country are focusing more on education and every government is making its own efforts.
It is also true that a considerable time has come for our people to set up educational institutions, to expand the education system, to set up schools and colleges, to incorporate teachers and to go to school.
In a way, an attempt to spread education was primarily made, and it was also necessary.
However, the importance of expansion is more important than that of development of our education system.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary aim is to provide good education to all through educational movement.
What is true is that we have to undertake a long-term journey.
But if the people of 125 crore country have decided that a long journey will also be possible.
We need to bring about fundamental changes, according to Sharmila ji.
Indias universities must become world-class competitive universities.
Just as the importance of education is equally important, the role of technology in education is going to be immense.
I am confident that distance education and technology will facilitate our education and the results will start to appear in the eyes in a short span of time.
Greetings to the Prime Minister, I speak to Mona Karnaval from Bijnor.
In today's era, sports is even more important than education for the youth.
It is essential to have a team spirit and a feeling of team spirit and be a good leader that will lead to their overall development.
I can say this through my experience because I have been an organisation of equivalents of India which has a good effect on my life.
This required greater coordination.
Their wide range gave me a heartfelt satisfaction and they had a lot of enthusiasm and they had to do something.
I myself have been a shield in the National Centre, I know that through these institutions, a new perspective is being created.
I have enjoyed the benefits of my pedestrianism, I have to fill up a new energy in these institutions and give a new impetus.
This time I have a few things in front of them.
During this season, why should not our youth and all the organisations participate in the massive task of water conservation
How many circles, how many districts can we prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the issue of compulsory thinking.
I see this as a shocking thing.
You will be aware of the political situation in our country, how many gas cylinders our party will provide was a matter of debate over the past several elections.
On the other hand, economists have been pressurizing subsidies to reduce subsidies, causing several groups to set up and give advice and decisions on subsidies reduction.
Several crores of rupees have been spent on the operation of these committees.
But today my heart is filled with pride for the people of my country.
But if you look at the account, more than 80 percent of these 1 crore people went to the distributors themselves, queued up, gave them a written form and quit their subsidies.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives a slight relaxation in some taxation system, it will shower appreciation on television and news channels throughout the week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
This is also an event that has forced the country's economists to think in a new perspective.
Even among the world's economists who present a variety of possibilities, this is an extraordinary phenomenon beyond their thinking.
We have to think about it at some point.
This is an extraordinary thing that if one crore families abandon subsidies, replace them with one crore poor households with gas cylinders, the survival of one crore households by abandoning subsidies, the ordinary thing that appears to be more ordinary when they look upwardly, the extent to which they can be achieved when they believe and act on the people.
I urge all the political leaders to say something wherever we go, wherever we trust people.
You will be able to get the benefits that you cannot even think of.
We have to travel in this direction.
For instance, why should we conduct a direct examination for the 3rd and 4th level workers, why should we not put faith in their selection marks
Even if I can make an announcement that there will be no ticket checkers on some railway tracks, I feel like doing so.
Let us trust the people of our country, let us do many such tests.
Once we trust the people of our country, there will be immense benefits.
This situation has not been created by some political leaders, it has created one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written to me - Good News everyday, good day and every day, tell your officers to tell you about a good thing.
The bad news in every newspaper and the media is being said to be breaking news.
Is there no good thing going on in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had sent me a letter, saying that we will not even release a bad news on Monday and will release a positive message.
What is true is that there has been a positive news environment.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives the best information, however, however beautiful it can be explained in a better way, it can be derived from the best news.
Good news is an illusion for good work.
The more we strengthen good, the lesser the place for evil is the truth.
If we take the fire, the darkness will automatically depart, and surely depart.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji, you have given good advice but please don't be angry with me.
Together with all of us, we will work in constructive endeavours, to talk about creative things and to take positive things forward.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
Many people of the world are unaware of the fact that millions of people come to the bank of the river for several days.
The festival is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events are systematically achieving greater standards as peoples participation in programme management dimensions.
For the past two days, I have been watching the films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I would like the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Governments to organise a photographic competition.
You can ask the people to give me the best photos.
This can definitely be done.
In the meantime, when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention has been paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival but it is also aimed at ensuring that people take the idea of cleanliness from there to their hearts.
While I accept that Kumbh Mela is a festival related to spirituality, I believe that it will also become a social opportunity.
How we can increase our love for water, how we can harvest water and how we can use Kumbh Mela to spread the message of water harvesting.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
It seems to me that you are talking to me but I am trying to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to you in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Last time I had spoken about a book containing the stories of Breamsanth ji and whoever wanted to read it, you might remember that share your thoughts about it through the NarendraModi App.
A large number of people have expressed their views on books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and living standards.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I'm sure I'll talk about some other books.
But nowadays I don't get enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to take forward the experience that we have experienced in the last one month.
Friends, what is the truth about water conservation - but even before that, I feel that water conservation is a matter of great pride for the common man.
For a few days, the whole country has been embracing the entire country, it is water.
Several serious efforts are being made to influence the entire country on water conservation.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has also stepped up several innovative movements related to water conservation.
I am very happy to learn that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the Northeast, has created a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
In Haryana, less water consumption is being encouraged to cultivate crops that are not harmful to farmers.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And especially the achievements of the children and their success gives us enthusiasm and new energy.
And the things which I shall now say shall bring you glory and joy.
We all are well aware of the kind of tremors that a word called cancer can produce in the world.
As death waits on the doorsteps, these 10 children have not only driven out cancer in their struggle, but have also praised the name of the country because of their wonderful work.
This month in Moscow - World Children's Winners Games World Child Winners Competition was held.
The bed comprises of gunfire, square, swimming, drive, timelines, table tennis etc.
These 10 winners of our country have won medals on this occasion and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success that India has achieved in space beyond Chandrayaan II will give you joy and pride.
Sanjayeev Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Taka from Golkata, B.
Many people like Arvind Rao have been urging the NarendraModi App and MyGov from different parts of the country to talk about Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In terms of space, India has to commemorate the year 2019 as the best year for space.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
In the run-up to the election, we were unable to talk too much about the enormous issue of A-Sat.
But the A-Sat missile is about 300 km above the Earth in just 3 minutes.
On the 22nd of July, Bong Chandrayaan jumped into 2nd App with pride across the country.
Chandrayaan 2- This goal is important in various dimensions.
Chandrayaan 2 will help in furthering our understanding of the Moon.
Even in our lives, we will face temporary setbacks
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to present an interesting competition for the student wealth of the country and the youth of the country and I would like to appeal to our youth to participate in this competition.
The knowledge of space, Indias space programme and science technology will be the essence of this competition.
For instance, what is required to be done in rocket launch, how the satellite is placed on the circuit, what are we getting from the satellite, what is A-Sat
On MyGov web site, the competition is scheduled to be held on 1st August.
I invite my young friends and student wealth...
I appeal to all the schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to win your school.
I encourage all the student wealth to connect with it.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in each state to Sriharikota at their own expense.
Moreover, they will also get the opportunity to see the landscape of Chandrayaan in the month of September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given a boost to the cleanliness drive over time.
Similarly, the efforts being made for cleanliness have also inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago today has set new benchmarks for cleanliness with the help of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.
I have not said that we have achieved the blessings of cleanliness but the success of the cleanliness drive from the habit of open defecation to the public and the unwavering power of 130 crore countrymen
But we are not going to stop with this.
This movement is now moving from dirty to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to know through the media about Yogesh Saini and his team.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer, who has left his job in America and has returned to serve Mother India.
Some time ago, he made a challenge not only to make Delhi clean, but also to make it beautiful.
Together with his group, he began his work from the rubbish tanks in Lodhi Garden.
You must be aware of the fact that all the streets of Prayag have been painted on the occasion of Kumbh.
I also came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had shown their handwriting there too.
We also experience it in the beauty of Swachhta Mission.
Wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had to read an interesting comment in MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian area of Jammu Kashmir, has recorded this.
I like the Mann Ki Baat program.
I am happy to note that I have contributed constructively in the Village Return programme to bring the society together in my state of Jammu Kashmir.
The Action Plan was organized in June.
I think this will be the first action plan that people directly intervene with the government.'
Many more things have been added to this programme to make it more interesting.
Under the Khelo India programme, sports competitions were organized for children.
They were awarded sports equipment, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Certificates, Scheduled Tribes Certificates.
In a way, this arrangement, the festival of development, the celebration of peoples participation, is a celebration of public awareness.
People participated in this developmental festival of Kashmir in large numbers.
While it was a matter of joy that the action plan for the return of the village had been carried out in the inner villages, the government officials climbed all the difficult hills to reach such remote villages and walked for a couple of days.
The officers also visited the border villages that have been firing from beyond the border for ever and ever and ever, without any fear of the worst affected areas of Shobian, Pulwama, Gulgano and Anantnak districts.
If the reception given to them has affected many officers, they have spent more than two days in these villages.
Organizing Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, ensuring large number of peoples participation and setting up of projects for themselves are comfortable.
New determination, new enthusiasm and wonderful results.
This makes it clear that those who seek to sow obstacles and obstacles in the journey of development will never succeed in the months of their atrocities.
My dear countrymen, Dattatreya Ramachandra Bendreya, who won the Gyanpeeth Award, has written about Mari Kaal in one of his poems
People from different cultures and languages across India have celebrated the month of Maritime on their own.
If we look around us in this season, the earth will be seen as if we have waged some green war against it.
On all four sides, a new energy thrusts.
In this sacred month, many devotees take refuge, Amarnath pilgrimage, and many are fasting, and with great enthusiasm wait for festivals like Janmashtami, Naga Panchami.
It is during this period that Raksha Bandhan also comes as an expression of the love of sisters and sisters.
When we talk about Marikalam, this time you will be happy to know that devotees have been participating in Amarnath Yatra in more than four years.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people who participated in this pilgrimage for 60 days in 2015, this time the number has crossed in just 28 days.
I would like to specially congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality in the backdrop of the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have returned after completing their journey are all attracted by the hospitality and sentiments of the people of the state.
All these will be very useful for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttaranchal this year Saradham has started pilgrimage and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple just in the last four and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity of 2013, a large number of people have undergone a pilgrimage.
I urge you people to go and enjoy some places of beauty in the monsoon season, wherever they may be.
There cannot be a bigger one than tourism and pilgrimage to see such beautiful places of our country, to feel the feelings of the people of our country.
May this magnificent and vibrant month of Maritime bring new energy, new aspirations and new aspirations to you all.
Similarly, in August, the White House is bearing the memories of the uit India Movement.
On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in different parts of the country and people of many parts of the country have been affected by floods.
When we see the rain on television, we get a glimpse of it - the floods, the floods, the waters and the transportation system.
I will come back after a month's wait.
Today people from Christian community across the world will be celebrating Easter Thiruvananthapuram.
Today, when India is dancing with Australia, I extend my best wishes to both the teams.
India won the Gold Medal in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India ranked 4th in the 1956 Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been brought down to a very low ranking.
Today, if our position in the rankings of the FIFA has fallen, it is difficult to give up.
Be it EPL or Spanish League or be it Super League of India, today I see the increasing interest in footprint for Indian youth.
The youth of India are watching television to know more about footprints.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity to take footprints to every village and every street.
What kind of opportunity is the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup that we have to strive to create a new zeal for youngsters in every corner of this year.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
My dear student wealth, you must have planned to visit tourism on holidays.
Maximum number of people go abroad, most of them travel in their states for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
I wonder if there is one of the districts that I have not visited in India.
I have the greatest strength of tourism in creating our lives. Nowadays Indian youth are very enthusiastic about tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the path that they have built, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think this is a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if coal is blackened, the others will run away automatically.
But it gives us the pleasure of setting up a tourist circuit with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far, more than ten thousand people have experienced the coconut mining tourism that is perfectly suitable for the environment near Sawaner village near Nagpur.
It provides an opportunity to see something innovative.
Can you contribute to cleanliness during this vacation when you visit other places
This may not have been done scientifically, but what is happening is true.
Can you also act as a tourist with a strong commitment to Swachhta at the tourist centre
In comparison to the world, tourism in India is far behind.
But if the 125 crore people decide to strengthen our tourism sector with a single heart, then we can attract the world.
Come on, let's try to move in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like the holidays or the holidays.
You also think in this regard.
Can your vacations go waste the important years of your life and the moments of their importance
I'm offering you a thought for your child.
Can you develop a skill during your vacation or can you add a new thing to your personality
If you don't know swimming, I will learn swimming during vacation or if you don't know how to drive a bike.
Even today, if I typically typically typically with two fingers, can I do a physiotherapy training
How many capabilities are there to develop our personality
Why can't we learn them
Why don't we remove our grievances
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Now think about this, there is no need for greater training, no trainee is required, no higher fees are required, no big cost.
This will also be a dialogue with other friends.
I am sure you will do this and tell me what you have learnt newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Greetings, Prime Minister, during the last summer vacation, you had said that birds and birds should warm up so that we should keep them on a balcony or on the floor of the house so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which I became friends with a lot of birds.
This time again I urge you to express this in your hearts.
He has telephoned me and reminded me of a good thing.
I was asking you to fill in the soil vessels outside your house during the summer.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds like him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the world's greatest poets in the literature of Hindi literature, had a great deal of influence on birds.
He said in his poems, I will not allow you to go away, I will fill you with grains, I will fill the cool wine everywhere.
Mysore's Shilpa Cooke has presented a very sensible idea.
Have we ever given them water to drink
My sincere thanks to you, Shilpa, you have put forward the most emotional idea in a very natural manner.
My farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people can say that this is Digital India which is a matter of some urban youth.
If you pay the App for the convenience of these farmers on your mobile phone, all the information related to agriculture and the weather will be available in your hand.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the position in the markets, what is the tendency of good harvest and what kind of insecticides can be obtained from it.
And if you ask any questions of them, they answer or make you understand.
I would like my farmer brothers and sisters to hand over the App to their mobile phones for the convenience of these farmers.
We have taken the initiative to create wealth for water conservation through Manrekha.
There may be many villages that have created such awareness in the country, the predecessor farmers may be many, the citizens of many awareness.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
According to statistics, 3 percent of the total deaths occur due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types, one type and the other type 2.
Type 1 is a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic composition.
Type 2, because of habits, because of age, body becomes fat.
This is the theme of World Health Day on 7th because the world is facing a diabetes problem.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Physical labour is declining.
Would we get concentration on 7th April to be able to overcome diabetes in our lives
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check-up with difficulty.
It is only after the situation has worsened that there has been diabetes for a long time.
Our country is less than the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries.
This disease can be ended by proper treatment.
India must be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated by just governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of our country to overcome diabetes and eliminate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, several important events are scheduled to take place in April, particularly on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated across the country throughout the year.
I have had the privilege of visiting Mhow, the birth place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
Baba Saheb has given us all that is required to become a better citizen.
We can travel on the way he has shown and live as a good citizen and make him feel better.
Vikram will start the year in a few days.
The New Year is being celebrated in different states in different forms.
My New Year greetings to all.
Last time I had told you that you can hear the voice of my mind whenever you want, you know this thing, you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at a very comfortable time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am also happy to be with you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Easter.
My young friends, all of you will be on the one hand in the examination.
It's a great inspiration.
You may be aware that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year in 2017.
What I say is to insist on increasing the interest in footprints, but when we open the doors of India, will we be guiltless and guiltless
Last time also I had an appeal to you that wherever you are going, please give me the photo of that place.
The work that was not done by the tourism department, the work that was not done by our cultural department, the work that was not done by the state governments and the government of India, has been done by crores of people of the country.
It's really a pleasure to see all the photographs they've done.
We have to take this task forward, do the same thing this time too, but do this thing by adding something else.
Not just sending a photo but also showcase your creativity, you can know a lot of things when you go to a new place.
India is a country of diversity.
Once you start traveling to see it, you will be traveling all your life, you will be enjoying it.
We generally think that coal mines should be removed.
When we see pictures about the people, we will go there and imagine what will happen
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Whether it is the government, the institutions, the society, the citizens, all of us will join hands in this task.
Your personality will be recognised and your self-confidence will increase to a great extent.
They are selling milk near our homes, newspaper sellers are coming, postmen are coming, sometimes the play sellers or cloth sellers are passing through.
Have we ever asked if you want to quench their thirst when the summer is hot
Only then can one drop of rain water be used without being wasted.
The beginning of farming for farmers is a very important one.
But if there is no water then we should think of what will happen to the people of the country.
This time you might have noticed that 5 lakh lakes are trying to construct irrigation lakes.
At my young age, I still remember that as soon as I hear the name of DB, people are scared.
To get rid of tuberculosis, proper treatment is essential, complete treatment is important.
If we leave half the treatment then the disease will come back again.
Give me mystic foot, whenever you have time, you can listen to the sounds of the ancient Mann Ki Baat and listen to them in your language.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you.
In a way, this is my fulfilment of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held in 2016.
In a way, we can say that every festival leaves the expectations of the next festival.
Sometimes India can also be called a fast-paced economy by festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the people below the society.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas Festival and also for the years to come.
May the year 2016 bring a lot of joy and joy to all of you, let the new zeal, new zeal and new determination take you all to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities or the embarrassment caused by man.
What can be a greater happiness than this for humanity to live a peaceful life by eliminating them from all these things
Chawley Swarkar ji is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists come and people go to many places for Christmas celebrations
As our tourist destinations are clean, I welcome the ideas and images of India and the spirit of others.
I am bringing the ideas of Ganesh ji among the people.
If we are guests at our homes as guests in the tradition of seeing guests as gods then we are engaging in cleaning and cleaning the house immediately or not
Similarly, we have to keep the tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations of our country clean and clean.
I am happy to know that there are reports from all over the country about cleanliness.
From the very beginning, I have been conveying my best wishes to media friends on this issue.
Because they dug small and good things and take them to the public eye.
Considering that this work was extremely sacred, I had to study the fact that he had constructed hundreds of toilets only in the village of Bhojpura.
The country has been making rapid strides due to the sustained efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress with shoulders and moving ahead with the country.
Excellent education, improved skills and increasing employment opportunities
Livelihood insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, uninterrupted global trade and setting up of new enterprises are on the one hand.
Everyone from a simple family who cannot go near the banks is now able to get easy loans through Mudra Yojana.
Nowadays, Indians have started to understand that the entire world has started taking part in the art of Yoga.
When the entire world celebrated the International Day of Yoga, how pride was there in our country or not
This feeling will come to us only when our thoughts and thoughts are at a large scale.
And it came to pass, when his mother opened the mouth of Jasoth, that she had butter, who could forget what she saw there, and what she saw there, and what she saw there
Similarly, Yoga Day has made us Indians feel the significance of India.
Nowadays, talk about cleanliness is echoing in every household.
Be it a farmer or a poor man, a young man or a mother, the feeling that they have been the cause of a change in their lives will give a bigger heart to the government officials who are engaged in the task of bringing electricity to those villages.
Can't I do everything alone alone
But when I talk about this, shouldn't I give my contribution
Even a simple citizen can join me by offering an App called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone.
I am sharing these simple things.
It is a matter of happiness for me that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us all come together to deal with the interests of the common people, let us take it to the common man, let us motivate them to obtain their decent things.
My young friends, on August 15, I presented a basic idea of Start Up India and Stand Up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the idea of this thing has been intensified in all the departments of the government.
Can India become the start-up capital
Start up India, Stand up India, has provided a great opportunity for the younger community.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will launch the Startup India Standup India initiative at full swing.
We have a stable idea about start-ups that the digital world is the only people in the IT sector.
We have to make changes in this regard keeping in mind the needs of India.
The intellectual potential of our younger generation is spread all over the country.
This start-up india and stand-up india should not exceed in some cities, it should spread to the brink of India.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On January 16, I will definitely have a detailed discussion with you about this.
I look forward to your views with eagerness.
My young friends, on January 12, the birthday of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me in this country.
From 1995 to January 12, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda as the National Youth Day.
The celebrations will take place in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from January 12 to January 16 this year.
I especially urge my young friends to send your comments directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chouhan from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is a disabled person who observed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Dileep Ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet humans like him in our lives, there will be solid thoughts in our hearts.
The outlook of human beings like him will be revealed on the basis of our thoughts.
There is no doubt that I have a great significance in words.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, arrangements were made to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there due to the severe floods and I could not participate in this programme.
Despite not being able to participate in this programme, I had thoughts about it in my mind.
The need for innovations, technology requirements, organisations and understanding is needed to simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, easily accessible automobiles, lifts and linguistic writings in all ways.
They should not be clothed in the walls and dying.
Wasn't there any plans for the common man or for the poor
Efforts were made a few days ago on how to simplify the benefits of the scheme to the beneficiary.
The subsidy for gas cylinders is being distributed in our country.
It costs crores of rupees but no account has been filed for it.
The government has made a small change in the supply of subsidies to know whether the subsidies reach the real beneficiaries or not at the right time.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Pahal Gas Yojana.
These 15 crore beneficiaries are directly receiving subsidies for their bank accounts.
This is happening without intermediaries, recommendations and any possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign for Aadhaar Identity Card, on the other hand Jan Dhan bank account opening, on the other hand, the Central State Governments have been working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link them to Aadhaar Identity Card and Bank Account.
There were so many accusations about the scheme.
In many places, the bank accounts of money-made workers are being directly put into account.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries regarding about 35-40 projects.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, a golden moment for the Republic of India.
It is a very pleasant coincidence that this day is the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to take this forward.
Only during the elections, more advertising is a sacred duty to vote, written on walls and plates.
We will talk a lot about all the duties in the election season, but why not talk about the same duties in everyday life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can we organise a poem competition, poetry competition and dialogue competition in schools, colleges, in our villages and cities, in different societies and associations with a reason to celebrate 26th January
When the 125 crore Indians embrace each other with a sense of duties, then see how big a history will be created.
On 26th January, when we commemorate the Republic Day, cannot we clean and decorate the holy statues of the leaders of our city and the surrounding places with the help of citizens, through schools and colleges
As citizens, I would like to put forward this idea.
The leaders whom we are emotionally engrossed in laying down the idols of sages, we later reflect upon the dedication to the maintenance of those statues.
Can we continue to clean up as a society and as a nation
On January 26 this year, we will join hands with all of us.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes for 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the Christmas festival is underway.
I have a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also useful for wounds, sometimes they give new incentives.
But sometimes when there are difficulties during festival days, they are more sad.
From every corner of the world, there have been constant reports of natural disasters.
Until now, there have been reports of disaster incidents that have not been hungry.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
State governments are fully involved in rescue and disaster relief operations.
The central government has always worked shoulder to shoulder.
I am confident that even beyond all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will be once again on the path of rapid progress and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But when we face such a terrible climate on all sides, there is a feeling of a change.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural calamity was associated with the agriculture sector because at that time the natural calamity was only drought and famine.
Governments, civil society, citizens, small and large organizations have to work scientifically in this area of skill development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to interact with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that a joint activity should be undertaken to collaborate with the South Asian countries to combat disasters.
I am happy to note that a thematic symposium in this regard and a seminar on best practices for combating disasters has been held in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I speak to Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming and guiding many more in agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing organic farming
It gives you even greater happiness that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concerns are justified but this is not happening only in the states of Punjab and Haryana.
This is our usual practice throughout India and traditionally we are burning the agricultural wastes that are being produced after the yield.
We were unaware of the evil caused by this kind of burning in the past, all of us used to do it, so I used to do it.
Because of these things it continued and it has been growing and today it has been associated with climate change.
After the impact of this embarrassment began to reach the cities, the voices of the people started shouting.
The concern you have expressed in that way is true.
For the first time, our agricultural friends should be trained and they should explain the truth.
After this, burning of post-harvest agricultural wastes can save time, reduce the difficulty and make the land ready for the next one.
But this is not the right regulation.
Even the post harvest waste is very precious.
They are naturally fertile.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces then they can be guests for animals.
Secondly, because we burn them, the layer on the ground is lit.
My farmer brothers and sisters, just think for a moment, our bones are certain, our heart works well, our kidneys work properly, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body burns then can we survive
If the skin of our body is burnt to death, we cannot survive, similarly if we burn after the harvest and the remains of the agricultural produce, the skin of the mother Earth burns, the layer of our land burns
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I had an opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in banana cultivation.
They shared their excellent experiences with me.
Earlier they had to spend 500000, 15000 rupees per hectare to evacuate the livestock after harvesting their livelihood.
There was no work going on till the man who had to take them to the tractors.
Last time, I had spoken about body donations in Mann Ki Baat.
In this regard, I mentioned the NOTO free phone number.
Many prominent personalities like film actress Raveena Dundan have joined them.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What could be a bigger donation than this
The National Level Organ Transplant Registration Centre (NLOR) was launched on November 27, with details of patients waiting for organs and body donors.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this field and I hope that the needy will get help from time to time.
Because unless there is no one to donate, this help will not be available in any way.
I had earlier said that on 3rd December, we are going to observe Divyangjan Day.
Physically handicapped persons are immensely brave and incompetent.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as funny things, the mind feels sorry.
Sometimes compassion and compassion are expressed on them.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct their vision then they will be a vision for us, they will be a vision for us, they will be a visionary for us to understand the achievements.
It is a matter of great appreciation that their determination, their devotion to life, their ability to transform their obstacles into favourable benefits.
Today, I would like to talk about the 40-42 year old Javed Ahmad Ji.
In 1996, extremists fired at Jawad Ahmad in Kachmir.
But Javed Ahmed did not accept the defeat.
The wounds of extremism did not make him coward.
There was no role in his stimulus, a person who had not committed any crime had been punished with such a punishment, his youth was wasted, but there was no anger or cruelty in his mind.
Although the body has not cooperated, he has dedicated himself to the education of children for the past 20 years.
As a social worker, as a conscious citizen, he is today a sovereign messenger of persons with disabilities.
Isn't it sufficient for Javed to have a sense of compassion for all Indians
I would like to commemorate Javed ji's life, his vision and dedication on 3rd December.
Though I have been able to talk about Javed Ji just because of the lack of time today, all over the corner of India, such hypnotising islands are shining, they are encouraging livelihood, they are paving the way.
In that context, on December 3, we have to draw inspiration from them.
In many matters, we must work with governments.
The central layers, the lower middle class, the lower middle class, the lower class, the underprivileged, the deprived, the deprived and the oppressed, are all constantly associated with government and state-related organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they have somehow had a bad experience with government employees.
These couples are spending their wealth in the development of the poor in their retirement life.
The entire tribal community is a small village in Balasore district of Odisha.
It is a poverty-stricken village that is suffering from malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an ASHA worker from this village, decided that I will ensure that none of these Denthakas die due to malaria.
He has stepped up the struggle against Malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
There may be so many such jamunas in the country.
You should not only study but also recommend to others.
Productive energy is the biggest power.
You also share good events related to this, share these e-books and communicate with them.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is deeply concerned about climate change.
National Energy Conservation Day on 14th December
Several schemes are being implemented on the government side.
The LED pulp movement is progressing drive.
Once I had said that Purnami should embrace the street lights on the night and wet it for an hour in full moonlight.
A friend had sent a link in my sight and I had the opportunity to see it.
I felt like sharing it with you.
He is trying to use solar energy to give light to the poor, fighting with darkness and acting in accordance with his name, he has created a group of women.
Launched a solar powered lunar lighting workshop.
He is offering these lunar lamps at a cost of 100 rupees per month.
People take these lamps in the evening and get them lighted in the morning.
As far as I have heard, I know that nearly 500 households offer such e-Governance loans.
Throughout the day, Nurjahan has been working to provide e-Governance to the beneficiaries.
But a good beginning has been drawn.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have received 42,000 crore rupees through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I had earlier said that Swachh Bharat would create such entrepreneurs.
They have acknowledged this by Silesh Bonsley.
He is doing this by buying a tanker and in a short span of time he has repaid a loan of Rs. 2 lakh to the bank.
This is our objective of the Mudra Yojana.
Similar information was given about Mamta Sharma from Bhopal.
He also received 40,000 rupees from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is engaged in handmade work.
Because there is no need to pay more interest, about 1000 rupees per month remains.
There was a good profession for his family.
But I want to make this scheme more popular and expand.
All our banks should approach it with greater understanding and come forward to help small businesses in large numbers.
In fact, they are acting as the economic drivers of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
We want to encourage them.
It's good, but it's going to be even better.
This means that Rashtrayam Jagryam Area, Eternal Vigilance is the price of liberty, which means that it is the price that we pay for freedom to be awakened permanently.
The country's unity should continue to sound.
But I expect more suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely be on the path of fruitfulness.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is about to start.
Once again my best wishes to the people of my country Jai Hind
Once again I have got the opportunity to interact with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the 5th day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
Gandhi Mandela continues to be a 5-day cricket competition.
Therefore, interest in final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all the friends of All India Radio.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the friends of the Kannur Radio Station.
Once again I would like to mention about Kerala.
Clean Mary Upper Primary Schoolgirls from Citrus, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many respects.
One, these girls had registered their thumb mipe and dressed Bharat Mata in a very large cloth.
They have sent me the map of Bharat Mata.
First of all, I wondered why they have drawn this film with their thick mipe records.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I knew how big they had sent to me.
They are engaging themselves in the movement of awareness about organ donation.
Vasant Rao Suduke, about 80, of Maharashtra, has been running a movement for a long time.
He says he should celebrate body donation as a festival.
Nowadays, I have received many news and telephone calls.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent me a message like this.
From Delhi, I am happy to note that the efforts of the government towards physical donation and the policy initiatives related to it.
Countries like China are very advanced in matters of body donation and I feel that the government's goal of donating one million organ donations is commendable and this thing is very important.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in a country with a population of 125 crore, we can only implement 5000 physical organ transplants.
Every year there is a need to give light to one lakh eyes.
But we can only give attention to 25,000 people.
We can provide only one person with eyes when four people need eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good progress in simplifying the administrative procedures in this regard.
I would like to say that Tamil Nadu is the first member of the body.
The 24-hour helpline serves by 1800 114770.
Our ancestors are also shouting as honeymoon Punjeetha
That is, the joy that they have got in sacrifice has been described by the mantra of Honey Triktena Punjeetha.
During the last few days, Delhis GST rate has been increased to more than Rs.
This operation was successful, saved a life.
A few days later, we are celebrating Deepawali.
We also celebrated Eid and Vinayak Chaturthi festivals.
India-Africa Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2019.
This is the first time that such a big conference will be held on Indian soil.
Heads of 54 African countries and Unions have been invited to participate in the conference.
The population of our two countries is one third of the world's population.
It is said that India and Africa had been the only terrain hundreds of millions of years ago and later they were two parts of the Indian Ocean.
We have great solidarity.
Indias wildlife and wildlife can see a lot of similarities.
Natural resources also have great comparison.
About 27 lakh Indians have lived in Africa for many years.
India and Africa have linkages in economics, culture and politics.
But, above all, India is playing a major role in training younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India in human resource development and skill development.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has organized a very special event.
Competitions have been organized in schools connected with CBSE to compose poetry among all students and to increase their contribution.
Thousands of schoolchildren have written about Indian African connections.
Several lakhs of school students visited the exhibition, the people of the village saw that what the contribution of our brothers and sisters in the relationship between Africa and India was, people knew and understood that what was his impact on the minds of the people of these two regions.
There were many outstanding contributions in the competition.
A poem is a robbery of my heart, it is my favorite, so I would like to teach you this.
I congratulate Mirza, all the students who have participated in this competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, a parliamentarian Model Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, several Member Friends have completed this task.
They are fully engaged in this.
Last month, an interpretation workshop was organized in Bhopal.
In this context, the heads of the villages, the district governments, some parliamentarians and officers of the central state governments have jointly organized a detailed consultation on the Model Village Programme.
Through this, a lot of new ideas have emerged and they are inspiring.
I would certainly like to bring some things to your notice.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal habitations.
Unfortunately, it will be remembered when we talk about Jharkhand about Mao extremists, bombing culture and massacres.
Several areas have been destroyed by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
However, our senior parliamentarian Kariya Munda, who is a deputy speaker of the parliament, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, he put confidence in the minds of the people, he tried to give life to the government institutions, he encouraged the officers to come and work there.
He established the country to bring about development in the long-standing neglected area.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Village Project, a successful effort to create awareness among the masses has emerged in this village of Barsi in Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the distinguished parliamentarian Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are underway and he has created a great innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to students studying in schools there.
He called upon the upper classes of school students to study their parents in this class.
The school was in that way educating students in the morning and their parents in the evening.
Similar children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
Look, how big a transformation has been brought about in the society without any budget, without circularity, without any special facility.
This is the lesson that the Dwaraputi Gram Panchayat gives us.
This village is known for sugarcane production and sugarcane festival.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the Summer Festival in this village on March 11.
He has drawn our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of one thing that after the Deepawali festival last year, especially in our country, the media has organised a movement.
The way we try to clean up before the festivals, similarly, even after the festivals, it is perfect for you to follow it.
Our actions must be in every public event.
I congratulate all the media in India today.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and the commencement of one year after the launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the India Today Group had the privilege of participating in the event of Safai Giri.
During the last one year, he has been encouraging Swachhta activities through e-Divy, and his newspapers have news about it, and he focuses only on creative work.
He has connected about 55 to 56,000 children from Andhra and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Be it public places, railway stations, places of worship, hospitals, parks, etc, he has been running a cleanliness drive in many places.
These reports also strengthen the formation of a Clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme titled India My Nation.
The people of the country sowed the idea of cleanliness in the minds of the people in the wake of the awareness about cleanliness among the people.
NDTV organised a Swachh Bharat Mission.
There are many channels and many newspapers in our country and I cannot mention the names of all because of the lack of time but everybody has taken this movement.
Over the last several years, this village has been working as a catalyst for cleanliness and every generation has been actively working towards cleanliness.
A few years ago, the governor wrote that this village has been awarded Asia's cleanest village.
I am happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern region of our country, has been engaged in cleanliness for years.
It has become a culture of the village itself.
Such events give us confidence in ourselves that our country is clean.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, when I was speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that corruption had become cheaper in the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
In the last budget, we had made an important announcement.
As per this, you can pay your gold to the bank and get interest on your investment amount as well as the gold reserved in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be given to you through the bank interest.
Now tell me, my countrymen, will there be money for gold or not
Wouldn't the gold locked in vain turn into a full force
Don't keep gold in the house waste.
Don't miss the advantages of its safety and rotation.
So, we will not have to buy gold, we will not have to save gold, no one will ever be able to match the paper.
I will definitely dedicate this project that will provide security to the people of the country next week.
However, we have either been using foreign gold coins or have been using foreign gold coins.
Why shouldn't there be an indigenous index for our country
Thus, in the coming week, the Indian Gold Currencies, which were slaughtered in 5 villages and 10 grams of Ashoka wheel, will be released before the Danteras Holy Day.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the path of economic development and I am confident that your full cooperation will be there.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was born.
When Patel, who was the concept of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, was thinking about them, the entire India would be inspired.
This great man has contributed immensely to India's unity.
Not only these variations, but the beauty that has given us pride will not reach us.
Therefore, only diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last several years, a unity drive has taken place on October 31.
I have had the opportunity to participate in it before.
I have been told that this time too, arrangements are being made in different parts of the country and people are enthusiastically engaged in preparations for unity.
The unity drive is actually a drive towards development.
In other words, the guarantee for development is the drive to unity.
Come, let us pay tributes to Sardar ji.
We will carry forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, all of you are preparing for the Deepawali festival.
I specially urge the parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but even with a belief, we should take care of our children without any harm.
My dear countrymen, the day after Diwali, I will go to Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I firmly believe that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a tourist destination for our children when they go to Britain to study.
Babasaheb Ambedkar gave the message of his life as much as possible and lived for the country as possible.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Basaveswar had done for democracy and empowerment of women is a matter of pride for all.
The dedication of the Thiruvananthapuram Statue of Lord Basaveswar in London to the people of the world is an excellent example of the vision and vision of the greatness of India centuries ago.
On such an occasion, the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with confusion.
in. Your suggestions are coming to me.
Later, with your letters, events are being organized at All India Radio, government officials are invited to discuss and some people are trying to find solutions to these problems.
In a country like India, we need to learn many languages.
It is true that even though I have learnt some languages, I cannot learn so many languages.
In your language, I will definitely try to enter your hearts at 8:00 p.m.
See how beautiful our relationship has grown.
Over the last one year
Today we are putting our feet in the new year.
Once again my best wishes to the people of my country.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all. This is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great significance of peoples power in democracy.
I have an idea that is based on my life and that is why I have great faith in this peoples power.
But Mann Ki Baat has taught a lot of things, they have experienced and all of us have shown how great the power of the people is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that peoples power is the power of Mahasan.
I can say that keeping in mind the experiences that I have received in Mann Ki Baat, in the minds of our ancestors, there is great power and great truth.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio, they have not only seen these suggestions in paper but have seen them as the expectations of the masses.
For administration, information must be from the bottom to the top, guidance must be from top to bottom.
Who would have imagined that Mann Ki Baat would become a voice for information
But that's what happened.
On 2nd October, I had said that we are celebrating Gandhijis birth anniversary.
There was a time when there used to be gateways for the country, but today there is no need for gates for fashion.
Not much, I said buy something a bit.
I am glad that in the last one year, the sale of glasses has been about two.
It is difficult to discontinue subsidies for even the social belongings, the middle class and the middle class.
Nevertheless, they are driven away.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Isn't this the manifestation of people's power
Beyond the power circles of the States, the governments must learn the lessons that are capable, efficient and stable.
Whatever I had faith in, after the Mann Ki Baat programme, all these things have become my firmness.
Therefore, today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the people.
People considered the small things that I had said in a way and made them their own for the sake of the country and joined them.
What could be more enjoyable than this
This time, in Mann Ki Baat, I thought of handling a new approach.
I had requested the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Discussions from all parts of India have been accumulated so that the calls are no longer incoming areas.
It's a pleasant experience.
All age groups have given suggestions.
It was comfortable to hear some suggestions, while my groups are paying attention to the rest.
You might have spoken for a couple of minutes, but for me, your suggestions and messages are very important.
The government will certainly pay full attention to your suggestions.
Normally, negative thoughts are negative on all sides.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, the calls from the disabled, particularly those with visual disabilities, received a lot of appeals.
They cannot see television, it may be a major reason to ask for radio.
Pawan Acharya from Alwar, Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want the people of our country to listen to their suggestions and follow them.
My name is Pavan Acharya, and I am of Alwar in Rajasthan.
During the Deepawali festival, I urge the people of our country to make use of silky lamps in a big way and appeal to the people of our country.
Moreover, with the use of soil effluents, the environment is not polluted, but thousands of soil-employed poor people are employed.
If we listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya during the coming festivals then soil lights will be used in our houses, but I appeal to the people of the country that it will be lighted in the poor family.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the three forces on the occasion of Venkata Chaturthi.
After 50 years of the war with Pakistan in 1965, an exhibition titled Anjali for Gallantry was organised near India Gate in Delhi.
We have been questioning the glorious moments of the war, the unforgettable courage and sacrifice of our soldiers.
If you want to make history, you must understand the essence of history.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our nature and we should also provide the means for it.
I did not misunderstand this.
I clearly see that the Parliament of the country is also engaged in cleanliness debates.
Look, on the other hand, what can be a matter of pride for the country rather than talking about cleanliness by both the Parliament and the children on the other side
The movement of ideas is taking place, an atmosphere is being created against pollution and an awareness has been created about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
Once he said that if I want to choose between freedom and cleanliness then I would like cleanliness first and then I would like the country's independence.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhiji.
Kulshan Arora, from Delhi, has filed a report on the MyGov website.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji wanted to know about his century.
Even last year, I had suggested that the clothes of different types of fashions, dresses of different kinds, but they should be with me for dresses.
I beseech you, give me something.
Last time you almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have finished the work that the government has not been able to spend crores of rupees with a little help.
This is the peoples power, so I once again appeal to you in this regard.
My dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy for something else.
I would like to share this with you.
I had gone to Golkata in May and the family members of Subhash Bose had come to meet me.
His brother son Chandra Bose had organised the meeting.
Sandra Bose and his family were involved in this work and it was decided last week that more than fifty family members of Subhash Bose will come to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how this is a matter of great pleasure for me
Many of Subhash Babu's family members live in other countries.
Everyone is coming here for this reason. Do you know what kind of joy I can have
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to make it a habit.
I want the youth of the country to make an effort to connect themselves with the electoral rolls and participate in the voting.
In the election season, I am sure of saying one thing: first vote, then everything else.
Everyone has to do this sacred work.
I met a boy from the seventh grade Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras is studying 7th class at Kenya Vidyalaya, Hindu University.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
The 9-year-old daughter of Sadavruj Patel, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi.
She is a very poor family girl.
The whole singing is a top-down to this girl, but the biggest thing is that when she heard about any of the slogans of the Gita, she delivered it and gave her English explanation and Hindi language.
When I asked her father about this, he said she was telling this from her 5th year.
He further said that it is a wonder to all of us in the family.
It has made me a big impact on you.
Some children have an indulgence on popularity, but children Sonamuko has no such commitment.
I only felt that God has given her some special power.
I have met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month, we have to make the voice of your mind once a week, because we get more concentration from these.
Suddenly, you don't know what you want from me to get a job
Now it is perfect for a month.
A year has passed since Mann Ki Baat started.
Do you know how Subhash Babu used the sound
He started the broadcast in Germany and spread his ideas on radio for the people living in India.
Azad Hind made the beginning of the radio through a weekly news report.
He broadcast radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Urudhu and Pashtu.
Even me, a year has passed since my radio broadcast through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Your contribution is unprecedented for me.
Once again my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all.
Once again I have got a good opportunity to inform you about the voice of my heart.
People in the southern part of the country are celebrating the festival of Onam yesterday, the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated throughout the country.
The Government of India has implemented a number of new schemes for social security in the interest of the people.
It gives me great pleasure that in a very short span of time, all of you have joined these schemes in a wide range of ways.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had made a small appeal to our sisters to bring the benefits of these security schemes.
I have been told that about 11 crore families have been connected to this scheme in a short span of time since the launch of the scheme.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are mothers and sisters.
I consider this as a good sign.
My best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme cannot be implemented in such a short span of time in 60 years.
However, it is a matter of great happiness that all the departments involved in the implementation of this scheme, all the branches of the banks, all the strengths and minds of the banks have been involved in this thing and we have succeeded in this thing, on the basis of the information given to me so far, about 17.
They have saved 22,000 crores of rupees even when it was said that the geographical volume can be started.
The banking sector is also one of the key incentives of the economy, which has reached the homes of the poor.
Today 1.
25 lakh bank comrades are working on the field.
This has provided employment to the youth.
Now thousands of people have been empowered to take overdraft because of this scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all those associated with it and I appeal to all the poor people not to break your bonds with the banks at any time.
The banks are yours, don't leave you in any way.
We have brought the banks to the doorsteps of your homes, do not leave it, take it bitterly.
All of us have to have money in the bank accounts.
I have unwavering belief that you will certainly do it.
Just a few days ago, the incidents in Gujarat, the violence and the violence that caused the entire nation to lose peace, this is a natural feeling.
Such a serious incident has taken place on the soil of the birth of Gandhi and Sardar, which causes deep sorrow and pain to all the people of the country.
Peace, integrity and brotherhood - this path is right
On the path of progress, all of us should walk shoulder to shoulder.
Progress can only be solved for all our problems.
The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, has visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud to participate in this programme of Buddhist clerics from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to share my heart with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers, I have been saying this several times.
My farmer brothers and sisters, don't be afraid of my peasants.
I assure you that we will not take any action so that anybody try to guide you on the wrong path in order to make you smooth.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value but there is a unique significance in the thoughts and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
The term of the Ordinance will be expired from 31st August tomorrow.
This will ensure that farmers do not face economic losses.
For us, the words Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words but I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that this is a mantra.
The interests of the poor farmers living in the villages are in our hearts.
Therefore, in my Independence Day address, I had mentioned that the Ministry should not only be the agriculture sector but also the agriculture and farmers welfare sector.
We are taking this resolution forward at a rapid pace.
I'd like to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
Whenever we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to recall Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan remind us.
Our scientists are truly making excellent progress.
Several new information has been given to me.
This is compassionate and academic for me.
Several young scientists very quickly shared things with me and I dreamt of them.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should lead our student wealth towards science.
During my Independence Day address, I had also spoken about the need for a direct selection in the lower levels.
In the event of a direct election, every poor family and widowed mother has to wave in matters related to getting the letter of recommendation and seeking help from whom to get jobs.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the bottom.
I had said that there should not be a direct choice below a certain level.
It gives me great pleasure that the government is progressing at a rapid pace in this direction, the suggestions are being given, the resolution is almost complete and the method of direct selection for grass root level posts will be fatigued.
Today, there have been international leaders coming to India.
In order to reduce maternal and child mortality rates, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in India to implement call to action plans.
For the first time outside the US, this ideological meeting was held in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after childbirth.
As we have been released from polio, we have also been released from Tetanus, a cause of maternal and child deaths.
It is also accepted by the world.
But even today we have to save our mothers and save our pupils.
Brothers and sisters, Today, dengue waves are spreading.
The fact is that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very easy to get rid of it.
My appeal to Swachh Bharat is linked to it.
Even if we watch advertising on television, our focus is not on them.
While advertising in newspapers, our children are not paying them.
Awareness is being generated to the people on small issues in homes and on issues such as cleanliness and safeguarding of clean drinking water
Nevertheless, we dont care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities in it, but we don't know that sometimes there is water around us.
I urge you not to extend the cannon to death so easily.
Life is a very valued one.
The calls for death are not correct, due to lack of water conservation and neglect of cleanliness.
About 514 dengue fever detection centres have been set up across the country and free tests have been conducted here.
Timely testing and treatment is a life-threatening thing.
Your cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, festivals and festivals will be filled in our country in the coming days.
Why shouldn't we engage all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records have become a habit, huh
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy news with you people.
Hindra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of our tribal people are shining in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
Both of these brothers have made India proud.
This year, these two brothers have won this occasion and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But they are engaged in all these endeavours in the interests of ethnic groups - Team India, Vision for Tribals.
Everyone is contributing to the country's progress.
When we hear about such events, we feel proud.
Sometimes because of our vision, we commit terrible injustice to our younger generation.
I believe that this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience with the younger generation is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can learn a lot of things.
On Sunday on cycle, I have met a number of youngsters who have resolved to ride a bike.
Some people pursue it as a cycle day for one day a week that I will travel on a bike.
They say that I get the pleasure of my health and well-being for the environment and the happiness of the youth.
Nowadays, cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many who are encouraging the cycle journey.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
The achievements made by India's two youngsters are as remarkable as the country's honour.
The monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar in the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been in the forefront for a long time.
When the Indians around the world go to London, there will be a commemoration of Baba Saheb Ambedkar who will form the Maharashtra government.
I also extend my heartfelt congratulations and congratulations to the Government of Maharashtra, who is trying to set up these two monuments to make Baba Saheb Ambedkar proud.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
Poor people need pulses and they need a little bit of money to be included in porridge.
I am very happy to note that this time there has been an increase of 50 percent in pulses and about 33 percent increase in oilseeds.
My heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers on this issue.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July is the day of victory in the Kargil war in the history of our country.
The Kargil war is not only on the borders but every village and city of India has contributed to it.
I consider the 26th of July as a matter of great importance.
Just a few months after our government was formed in 2014, we launched the MyGov website on 26th July.
I am glad that nearly 2 crore people have gone to Mygov web site after the government has completed nearly a year and about 5. 12 lakh people have come to know about it.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions on the PMO application, have spent their golden time and have put their children in it.
They have made excellent suggestions.
However, the government has not yet taken into consideration the people in this regard but brother Akhilesh Vajpayees advice has been taken into consideration by the government and today we are implementing it.
Today, logo and tag lines are being created for any scheme of the government, projects are being devised, policies are being formulated, most positive suggestions are received on MyGov website.
Nowadays, even on 15th August, I have started receiving my suggestions on mygov address.
They have given me a lot of suggestions from Suchitra Thiruvacharya from Chennai.
He said that we should save our daughters, keep our daughters educated, talk about Swachh Ganga, Swachh Bharat.
This has inspired a thought in my mind and this time you can register your views on what I should address on 15th August.
You can send Mygov to the address, write to the radio, send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
In my speech on 15th August, it is a wonderful idea that I should get a place from the public.
I am sure you will give me the best ideas.
Two days ago, my child went to an accident in Delhi and after that accident, the life of the person who had travelled in a scooter split up for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
On several occasions people have been asking me to talk about road safety and create awareness.
It's all right for you.
If we ignore the statistics, the heart will stop.
There is an accident in our country every minute.
I urge the parents to create an environment of safety in the family, whether it is a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler, whether it is a child driving vehicle or a four-wheeler.
We are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill keeping in mind all these things, be it awareness about road safety, engineering related to road construction, law enforcement and emergency treatment for those injured after the accident.
In the coming days, we are also planning to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
From Gutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai and Ranchi, we have given importance to cashless treatment on national highways.
Accordingly, we are thinking about the best possible life savings and maintenance in the first 50 hours by postponing the issues related to who will pay the money, whether it is money or not.
We have to approach it primarily from the point of view of how accidents are not taking place, in fact, every living value is precious.
Sometimes I say that the workers should be gem Yogis.
In the last few days, I share with you some of the events that touched my heart with this idea.
It is a good feeling to see how everybody can bring livelihood even in their jobs.
Vijay Biswal has expressed how he can connect his country, his arts and his arts with his work.
I believe that the picture of Vijay Biswal will be a thing to talk about in the days to come.
A large group of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is working with my heart and it is my favourite wish.
Sometimes even small things are very pleasant, so I share them with you.
There is a village called Geshla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh.
Over the past few months, they have made an effort to build toilets.
Now no one from that village needs to spend natural resources in the open space.
Whatever happened, when it was completed, the entire village celebrated it like a big festival.
There are excellent examples of how values change in social life, how peoples outlook is changing and how citizens of the country are taking the country on the path of progress.
Bhavesh Day from Gauhati has written to me about the problems faced by the Northeastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a Ministry named DONER was formed, which means the Ministry of Development of North Eastern States.
Well, we cant decide the interests of the North-Eastern states sitting in Delhi or not
Hence, a team of officers from the Government of India visited north-eastern region including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort will have a good effect in the coming days.
This is a remarkable effort, an attempt to move from Delhi to remote areas, and this is what I call the ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to note that the success of the SEWAYAM mission has been accomplished.
Just a few days back, India has launched 5 satellites in the UK through its PSLV C28.
This is a great achievement, even though this news is not one of the most attractive things.
Sometimes when we ask the younger generation of the country, what do you want after you have grown then one hundred of them will answer that I want to be the most scientist.
The country's lack of scientific perception is a matter of concern.
With this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Mission.
You have progressed well after studying softly and you too should spend an hour or two in a week to encourage the students of your neighbouring schools and colleges, share your experiences with them and it will definitely help them.
Our villages have to get 24 hours of electricity or not
Though this work is difficult, it has to be completed.
Today, even if we want to charge the mobile, we have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should be extended to the villages and these facilities should be available to the underprivileged.
Towards this end, we have launched the Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages here and we have to ensure electricity supply to the most remote areas.
Your views will be a boon for me.
Thank you very much
When I said so, I didn't expect you to get such a huge response.
Hundreds of thousands of people sent photographs through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I also retweet some of them that attracted my thoughts.
If some say that some people did not record the photographs of the Bay of Bengal caves in Andhra Pradesh, many of the country would not have known that there were such caves.
This is the photo of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We always know Rajasthan as a low water state, but it is very surprising that one from there sends photographs of Manal waterfalls.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assure you that Yoga practices are not going to hide the sun in the world.
When we see how the world is spreading the red carpet of Yoga, what kind of respect and pride do we have in mind
And I drew in the flood of joy, and the heart was faint.
While the Cheen River and the Eiffel Tower are the most proud symbols for the people of France, they have chosen these symbols to be the backbone for Yoga training.
The Nyuark people learnt the Times Square to practice yoga.
Immediately, the Abera House scenes are reflected in the minds of Sydney of Australia.
The Austrians undertook yoga exercises in front of the Abera House.
Rajpath has been Yoga.
There was a new upsurge, a new spirit, a new zeal and a new zeal in all the crores of the world.
A few days ago, a Vietnamese child had televised a picture of yoga, which was very delicate and popular throughout the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, villagers, citizens, developed countries and developing countries are all involved in Yoga training.
Yoga is indeed a factor that connects the world.
I don't know how intellectual creatures will absorb and criticise the world.
But I feel that the world is very keen to know about India is a matter of pride for every Indian.
An interest in India has increased and the world wants to know about India's values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the pride and honour of our heritage then we can give the world a better idea.
Sometimes we think of what innovation is, for example, of our family values, and we don't know that Indias family values are a big thing for the world.
I would like to appeal to the youth of the country, particularly the youth in the field of Information Technology - all of you youngsters should jointly devise a scheme on online yoga activities.
Do you know that there is a sector called Ayush in the government
Nobody's attention will return to it.
Two or four times in five years it will be reported, a small department in one corner.
But it presided over Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has been the largest in the world.
This is an example of how small institutions can accomplish immense tasks when the goal is before us.
The world was surprised to see how our people rescued the victims of Eman.
In a few hours, the world saw that Indians rushed to Nepal and extended their support.
If we start to work with a firm resolve, the government will work faster, the government workers will work faster and the common man will also be celebrated with a pilgrimage.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power that makes the country progressive.
Last month, we announced three livelihood insurance schemes from Golkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people are engaged in life insurance schemes in some way but we have to take this forward.
I want to put an idea in my mind, I want to put it in front of you.
In August, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is going on, let us all start a strong mass movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan
Let us all, together with me, try to fulfil this pledge.
When I shout my heart, many people give me advice.
This time, many people have suggested to me that I should tell you something about the monsoon season.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Dhandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Nadakarni and Divyaanshu Gupta have been asking you to talk about the monsoon season.
They have also given good suggestions for their part.
You too may be enjoying this rainy season along with hot pakora, bajji and sweet tea.
Just as the sun rays give us life, the rain also gives us energy.
Each drop of rain is valuable.
As a citizen and as a society, we must nurture the spirit of protecting every drop of water.
Water in the village should remain in the village as well as the water in the city should be used for urban use.
Be it vaccines, water supply management or be it small ponds or lakes, we should protect every drop of water.
If you want to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, if you want to visit his house then you can see that there is a water conserved in his 200-year-old house where rain water can be directly transported.
You must see this.
Even at that time, this kind of concern has been taken.
We can do this too
It must be transformed into a mass movement.
Every village should be followed this way.
Similarly, Greens loot our eyes.
How compassionate is the green life
Tree plantations, gardens, parks, all of them turn their livelihood into green, isn't it
We all have to plant trees during this rainy season and the movement related to this must be implemented in a big way by the youth through social organizations.
I would like to suggest from my own experience that this rural technology is a very successful one.
And when you are in the middle of the tree, put an old earthen pot near the tree, and fill it with water.
Health is very important because microorganisms are multiplying because of the moisture in the environment.
Cleanliness is very important.
Drinking clean water is essential.
Most people drank water in this season.
There are also benefits from this.
The more we take care, the more we get protection from diseases.
There is a need for water and rain, but it is important to be safe from the illness moment.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now introducing three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
Under the Amrid Yojana, we have launched a movement to make our cities livelier.
By 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence, it will be an housing for all Indians.
Keeping these three things in mind, we have started a big scheme.
This inspired all fathers to take a selfie photo with their daughters and register on social networks.
In Haryana, the rate of girl child is very low compared to male children.
There are 100 districts of this kind of concern in the country.
This is very high in Haryana.
In a way, we will make the programme Beti Bachao Beti Padhao a mass movement.
Keep watching, you will feel that how much happiness the movement will bring about the rise, respect and protection of the daughters.
Secret the rainy season
Make our country green
I have experienced this.
Take this forward.
For the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will meet you next time.
Sometimes people think that I should announce the welfare schemes of the government in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
This is what makes me happy.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this intermediate period would have passed.
And it shall come to pass on Sunday, and on the last Sunday of the month, at 11 a.m., that, behold, the feeling that something is gone away from me, and that it is yours
But I thought that what happened at that time - no, it should be a Sunday programme.
But I was eagerly waiting for this Sunday.
Many people have asked me why I had travelled to Kedarnath in the midst of the electoral frustration.
But if I started traveling in that direction then it can change the course of Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, I have left when the polls and the polls continue to flare up and gain sympathy for victory.
Many view it as a political implication.
For me, I consider it as an opportunity to meet me.
In a way, I'm going to meet myself.
I can't say when I will do it, but I will definitely do it because it is my duty to inform you about your rights.
As the people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedar, I continue to realise that you are trying to strengthen positive things in your words.
The inclusions in the letters of Mann Ki Baat are entirely different from the customary governmental affairs.
Your words are sometimes open to the bed that is in the middle of my thought process.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against cleanliness and collaborates with the efforts to make cleanliness.
If one discusses the environment, it reflects his pain
But at the same time, he also mentions his efforts and describes his thoughts.
That is, in a way, a vision of how the solution to the problems can be consistent with the entire society will shine in his words.
Mann Ki Baat works as a glass to the nation and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of determination, energy and capability in the depths of the countrymen.
It is necessary to coordinate these strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and make a constructive effort.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore Indians want to be strong and constructive in the progress of the country.
One writes a letter to the country's prime minister, but you can imagine that he has not submitted any application for himself...
..how amazing the feelings of millions of such people in the country
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination of how much joy I have and how much enthusiasm it is there in me.
You're driving me, you're driving me fast, you can't imagine you're nurturing life within me every moment...
Without this relationship, I was waiting.
Today my heart is filled with happiness.
In this feeling, Ponga, with enthusiasm, we will take forward the voice series of Mann Ki Baat.
When emergency was created in the country, the struggles against it were not limited to political limitations or political leaders.
It has not been imprisoned even in the midst of prison bars.
There was anger in every citizen's mind.
There was a vision for the liquidated democracy.
You don't know what if you're hungry when you're having a meal every day.
Likewise, whenever one comes to know about the right to democracy in normal life, the joy that it enjoys, it is only when one breaks our democratic rights.
During the period of emergency, every citizen from all over the country felt that something had been broken.
I can proudly assert that India is a living society because of this tradition.
This is why the people of the country felt the lack of democracy, and we experienced this lack during the Emergency.
Therefore, the country had dedicated not for itself, but for the protection of democracy as a whole.
Whenever any thing is away from our pocket, we underestimate its significance and ignore its miracles.
More than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
This figure may seem simple to us, but if we see China from the point of view of the world, more people have voted in this election than in any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha election was more than double the total population of the United States than the population of the whole of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election is the worlds largest democratic election in history so far.
And imagine yourselves how great abundance of goods and men's wealth shall be required to administer such a great election.
This has been possible as a result of the hard work done by several thousand teachers, officers and staff overnight.
This time, due to the hard work of all of them, the polling booth has been more than the last time.
Nearly 1 million polling stations, more than 40 million voting machines and more than 17 million weightweightweight appliances across the country to vote.
I leave the grandeur of the arrangements to your imagination.
All this was implemented to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was established for only one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officers had taken two days to get there.
This is the real respect given to democracy.
The world's highest ballot base is located in India.
The polling station is at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahaul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another matter of pride in this election.
This may be the first time in history that even women have enthusiastically participated in the vote for men.
In this election, the voting rate for women and men was almost identical.
Another encouraging thing about this is that the number of women members in the House today stands at 78.
My dear countrymen, you might have often heard that the book is not a bouquet.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers on occasions such as receptions and glorification.
Since then, people have started collecting books in many places.
Now someone has given me a book titled 'Bremchand's famous stories, and I like it very much.
We have not had time for many days, but we have got the opportunity to re-read some of his stories because of his foreign travels.
Bremchand describes the reality of the society in his stories and when he reads, those scenes begin to migrate in your mind as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
The second story touched the depths of my mind and its name is 'Eidgah'.
And understanding of the mercy of a young man, and his pure love to his mother, and his tender heart at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his granddaughter by buying a piece of bread from the festival, the human spirit is really touching the height.
Likewise, the name of a tale that touches the chest is 'Pus Ki Rath'.
The story depicts a contradiction in the lives of a poor farmer.
Even after the destruction of his crop, why is a farmer named Haldu happy that he does not need to sleep in his field in the melting cold
But even though these stories are written about a century ago, we can feel that these are relevant even today.
After reading these things, I felt a lot of experience.
I was reading in some media about the Akshara Library in Kerala while talking about the subject.
Sometimes they came with bundles of books and carrying them on their backs.
Today, this library is showing a new direction not only to the children of the tribals but also to all.
Gujarat's Wanje Gujarat campaign is a successful effort.
In this campaign of reading books, millions of people of all ages participated.
In today's digital world, during the period of Google Guru, I would like to ask you to spend some time in giving a place to your books in the midst of your daily routine.
In fact, you will be very fond of this and write on the book you have read and on the NarendraModi App so that the voices of the mind can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to know that our countrymen are thinking about things that can emerge as challenges in the future without ceaselessly ending with the present.
When I was reading these comments on the NarendraModi App and Mygov, I was able to see many people writing about water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai from Belgaum and Siddamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, many others like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have written about water challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
In the accident of Rig Veda, it has been said about water: Abohista Myopuva: Than Kayuje Dattatana, Maharanaya Saxse, Yova: Sivadhamoras: Dasya Bhajayadehana: Ushtariva Matrah, i. e.
Water is equivalent to mother i.e. motherhood will enhance her blessings and enhance her compassion.
Water conservation has affected many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water that is being obtained due to rain throughout the year can be stored in our country.
It's just 8 percent.
So it's time to find a solution to the problem.
I am confident that like other issues, we can also solve this problem with the help of peoples participation, with the help of peoples power, with the help of 130 crore countrymen, with the help of cooperation and with dedication.
Considering the importance of water, the Ministry of New Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will facilitate quick decision-making of all water related matters.
A few days ago, I started doing some things differently.
I drafted a letter to the Panchayat leaders and village leaders of the country.
I had written to them to collect water, to collect water, to maintain every plant of rain water, to gather village councils and to interact with the villagers.
On 22nd of this month, crores of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
Every villager was determined to save every drop of water and contributed to their sympathy.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about the leader of a Panchayat.
The people there are once again ready to fulfill their constructive contribution towards water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the rural leaders who have worked constructively from my side.
There are several leaders who have taken up the challenge of water conservation throughout the country.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
I have a feeling that the villagers are now competing for some water in their village.
As I have said, there are positive results through social initiatives.
There is no single way to face water constraints across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose in different ways.
But the goal of all is to save water and maintain water.
Punjab's sewage canals are being improved.
This effort will get rid of the problem of blockade.
There is a change in the lives of the villagers due to the construction of hydroelectric plants at Thimmaiyapalli in Telangana.
There has been a major change in Kabirdham in Rajasthan due to the small ponds being constructed in the fields.
When I was studying a social effort at Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I knew that there were 20000 women mobilizing the work of reviving the Naga river.
At the same time I also read about the women of Garhwal region, they have done excellent work on collecting rain water in accordance with each other.
When people gather, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I offer three appeals to the people of our country.
My first appeal - just as the people of our country have transformed cleanliness into a mass movement, let us take the initiative to transform water conservation into a mass movement.
All of us will collectively resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that you are God's gift and that is a miraculous piece of rasamani.
It was said that Rasamani will be iron gold.
But even you are such a rasamani that the sprinkling of water produces new life.
We have to create an awareness campaign to save every drop of water.
My second request to the countrymen is that there have been several traditional methods of water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods with all of you.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar to the place of birth, then there is a 200-year-old water conservation kitchen in a house behind the brother's house.
Come, let us create a complete list of water conservation and inspire people to engage in water conservation.
You all should use JanShakti4JalShakti to share your thoughts.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you and the people of the world for one more thing.
Presidents of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, eminent people, ordinary citizens have shown me through Twitter how Yoga is being practiced in every country.
On that day, the world appeared to be a happy family.
We know that healthy and understanding individuals are required to establish a healthy society.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Shouldn't it be honoured to recognise such a service or not
In 2019, the announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for their outstanding contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga has given me a stimulus.
This award is given to the organizations that have contributed immensely to the promotion of Yoga throughout the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan conducts multilateral and training courses there
Likewise, Ms.
He is an example of cynicism.
When it comes to Yoga related matters, let us tell you whether India is behind
They have added to the Yoga Day that Yoga should be widely celebrated and those who bring the message of Yoga to every household should be honoured.
My dear countrymen, this journey has begun today, with new feelings, new experiences, new resolve, new hopes and new hopes.
Yes, as always, wait for your suggestions and views.
All of us will meet again and again and we will be happy to interact.
I listen to your feelings, I gather and understand.
Sometimes I try to live up to that feeling.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my condolences, you are my energy provider.
Come, let us all come together to enjoy the voice of our hearts, let us fulfill our duties in life on Tuesday.
Once again, we will meet again in Mandin's voice next month.
Many thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is immensely imagined to begin with the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
10 days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
These brave soldiers have lost their lives to save our 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave sons had dedicated themselves to sleeping peacefully by night without me.
After the martyrdom of our brave soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attacks, the hearts of the countrymen are wounded and boiling in anger.
There have been condolences from all over the world about the martyrs and their families.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country who sacrificed their lives to save Mother India.
The task facing this challenge before the nation must be forgotten by all the differences between casteism, religiousism and regionalism that will make our endeavours and decisions against extremism firmly and rigid.
Our armed forces have always been adventurous and mighty manifestation.
On the one hand, while expressing their excellent potential for maintaining peace, they have also responded in the same language as they can understand the attackers.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The military is determined to throw Kelly with the root of the extremists and their subsidiaries.
After the valour of the brave soldiers, the words and ideas that have been inspired by their relatives through the media have been widespread and strengthened all over the country.
Meena, wife of Prasanna Sahu, a martyr from Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, appreciates their unlimited adventure throughout the country.
He has vowed to include his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena's footsteps reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his son-in-law said he would join the army.
It is the phenomenon of this pizza that today, within the body of every child of India, there is a mixed feeling within the body of every child.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the son of Thilakraj, the martyr of Kangra or the six-year-old Balagan of Hemraj, the martyr of Kota - the story of every family of the martyrs is the inspiration of the spirit.
I urge the younger generation to know, understand and understand what these families have expressed, what they have achieved, what they have achieved.
In order to know all about patriotism, sacrifice and sacrifice, we do not have to repeat the past pieces of history.
My dear countrymen...
For such a long time, we all had waited for a memorial of war, that time of wait is going to come.
It is natural for the countrymen to have greed and enthusiasm in this regard.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty, a garment in Karnataka, expressed his happiness at the creation of a National War Memorial.
It is a matter of surprise and anguish that there has not been any National War Memorial in our country so far.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated with the legends of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the security of the nation.
I pledged that such a memorial must have been set up in the country.
The second wheel, the cycle of bravery, reveals the adventure and courage of the soldiers.
The valiant adventures of the soldiers will be engraved on the walls of this gallery.
Subsequently, the Martyrdom Chakra
This chakra indicates the martyrdom of the soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the nation will be engraved in golden jewels.
Subsequently, the rock wheel marks security.
There is a queue of dense trees on this wheel.
It is impossible to utter the enormous contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in terms of the country's progress.
In October last year, I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also created as a reflection of the feeling that we should be grateful to the men and women of our police forces who have always been safe.
I am sure you will visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, you must share the photographs you have taken there on the social web site so that others get inspired to visit these holy places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments come to me in different ways for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was reading your thoughts, one of the interesting ideas of AdishanMukobadya ji attracted my attention.
His age was only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on March 3, Jamshedji Tata ji's birthday is also a coincidence.
He added that these two men belong to the entirely different family backgrounds, but both of them fulfil the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
Giving charitable tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in the voice of Mann Ki Baat is in a way equivalent to respecting the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great men are not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
If we need an inspirational person to guide our youth today, he is Lord Birsa Munda.
And the English captured him while he slept with jealousy and jealousy.
Do you know why they have taken such an injury
Because even the British who established such a great empire saw him and feared him.
Lord Birsa Munda, with his traditional arrows, shook the British regime using guns and cannons.
Indeed, if we have a leadership that can motivate people, society's depression is greater than the power of arms.
The deceitful and the persecuted took them from darkness to shining sun.
Lord Birsa Munda was martyred at the end of his 25-year career.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have emerged from all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled everywhere that they could not see anywhere in India as a part of the freedom struggle that has been going on for centuries.
But it is unfortunate that the stories about their sacrifices, sacrifices and sacrifices do not reach new generations.
If people like Bhagwan Birsa Munda have realized our existence then people like Jamshedji Tata have given great institutions to the nation.
In fact, Jamsetji Tata, a visionary prophet, had not only seen the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was well aware that making India a hub of science, technology and industry would be a future requirement.
Because of his vision, the Tata Institute of Science was established and now it is known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Moreover, he established a number of trusted institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
As a result of this interaction, IISc was born.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai is 29th February.
You all are aware that this day will come only once in four years.
Accordingly, a peaceful person, Morarji Bai, was one of the leaders of the most regulated country.
Morarji Bhai Desai, who presented the highest budget statement in the Parliament of independent India.
Morarjibai Desai was a very difficult time when he led India in a skillful manner, during that period, the democratic system of the country was in a grave threat.
Morarji Bhai Desai dedicated himself against the urgency to defend democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his stomach.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janata Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his regime, the 44th Constitutional Amendment was passed.
Why it is important that the 42nd Constitutional Amendment was enacted to create a state of emergency, in addition to reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some of the other elements in it have broken down our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
That is, the 44th Constitutional Amendment empowered the functioning of the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies to be printed in the newspapers.
The President was the first to proclaim the state of emergency only on the recommendation of the Cabinet in writing and cannot extend the period of emergency by more than six months.
Morarji Bai ensured that the 1975 massacre of democracy could not be resumed by declaring an emergency.
His contribution to the protection of the glory of Indian democracy is immense and will be remembered by generations to come.
Once again I make my tributes to such a great leader.
They bring a positive change in the lives of others in a variety of ways with the help of their labour.
And as they are, they are really grievous: they are the service of the people, the service of the people, and the service of the people, and above all, the service of the nation without self-interest.
When Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen who will be the awardees.
In a way, I consider this as a great success because they cannot be seen in the television and the press cards, they are away from a world full of humour.
However, those who don't care about their name, they believe in working on the ground.
And they shall live by the singing of the song of Karmasu Kaushalam.
I would like to share with you about such people.
You must be aware of Odisha's Tathari Nayak, who has no reason to call him the canal man of Odisha, who has cut a mountain by his hands in his village and built a canal for three kilometres.
I conveyed the remembrance of former US President Barack Obama to the Tree of Life painting composed by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awardees, Shapir Saiyat from Marathwada is known as Pasutha's servant.
How he dedicated his entire life to the service of cows is very unparalleled and amazing.
Chinnupillai of Madurai, who for the first time made efforts to contribute to the power of the victims and the oppressed, through the Kalanjeeyam movement, initiated micro-constitutions on a social basis.
Even after hundreds of years, he teaches Yoga to people all over the world, so far he has made 1500 people Yoga practitioners.
Jamuna Tudu, a well-known woman named Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has done an adventurous job to oppose tree plunderers and naxals, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares, integrating tens of thousands of women to protect trees and wildlife.
Because of the untiring efforts of this Jamuna Ji, today every villager has 18 trees while every child is born and 10 trees are being planted during the wedding of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Musafarpura in Bihar, is very illusionable.
Nowadays, wherever I go in the country, I am trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, over the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefited from this scheme.
I can clearly see how big a change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the selective sessions are scheduled to start in schools.
Various boards of education across the country will start the board selection process for 10th and 12th classes in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the student students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to appear in the examination.
A few days ago, a major event called the Pariksha Pe Charcha in Delhi, i. e.
One of the salient features of the Exams Dialogue is that discussions are being held without restraint on various matters related to examinations.
Because we have thousands of years old culture and traditions.
A few days later, the holy day of Mahashivaratri is coming, this time, when Shivratri is coming on Monday, a special significance spreads a bright smell in our hearts.
Just a few days ago I had gone to Kashi where I got the opportunity to spend some time with differently abled brothers and sisters.
We could talk to them about many things, their self-confidence was really impressive and inspiring.
While speaking, a young person with disabilities said that he was a platform person and when he introduced himself as a mimixer on jokes, I asked who you would talk like.
He said I would like to speak like Prime Minister and mix with him.
And at the same time, when I would do something right, I had a pleasant surprise, just like I used to speak in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, he used to talk about Mann Ki Baat and made the voice of Mann Ki Baat through Mikri.
I was glad to know that people not only listen to Mann Ki Baat but also remember it on several occasions.
In fact, I was very surprised to see the power of the youth with disabilities and they had a great impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme has given me a lot of experience.
In a way, I have been interacting with millions of families on radio every month.
Whenever I talk to you several times, while reading your letters and listening to your telephone calls, I feel that you consider me as your family member.
This feeling enhances a comfortable experience in my mind, enjoys happiness.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we'll all be drowning in the electoral frustration.
I am also a candidate for this election.
To pay homage to a healthy democratic tradition, the next episode of Mann Ki Baat will take place on the last Sunday of May.
That is, on March-April, all my feelings of these three months, with a new hope after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, once again I will start my conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will travel together for years with the voice of your mind.
Once again I thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swami plays this philosophy.
In his 111-year career, he served for the social, education and economic development of thousands of people.
If his punditism was so widespread, he was well aware of English, Samskrit and Kannada languages.
He's a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in feeding people, sheltering, teaching and spiritual enlightenment.
Swami ji's main objective was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Siddhaganga Math is regularly organising cultivation and farm festivals.
I have often enjoyed the blessings of Swamiji.
Our former President, Dr. A.
On this occasion, Kamala Siya showed a poem written for Vanakacharya Swamiji.
This poem by Dr. Kalam Iyeah explains the life of Sri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji and the goal of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful way.
There is a very important institution in our country
This is a part of our democracy and a part of our democracy. I speak about the Election Commission of India.
This is the foundation day of the Election Commission on 25th January, which we celebrate as the National Voters Day.
Looking at the measure of elections held in India, the world is surprisingly turning its back on the nose
Polling stations are also set up in Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 15,000 feet and also in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the jungle of Kir, a polling booth has been set up for only one voter in one far-flung place.
Imagine, friends...
Keeping in mind the voters, to get the opportunity to use the voter's ballot status, the entire team of ECI staff goes to far-flung areas and conducts the voting system - this is the beauty of our democracy.
I heartily appreciate the Election Commission, which has been continuously working towards strengthening the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the States, all the Defence Forces, and other personnel who are free and discriminatory in the electoral process.
Lok Sabha elections are going to take place this year in our country
Young people born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections this time.
They have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the nation in their shoulders.
Now they are becoming partners in the process of taking decisions in the country.
The time has come for connecting their dreams with the dreams of the nation.
If you are eligible for a vote, I would urge you to register your name on the electoral roll.
If we cannot vote for some reason in life, we must feel that it is sad for us.
If we say something wrong has happened in the country then we should feel sorry.
This activity has to be transformed naturally.
I urge all of us to join hands in registering a voter and vote on the day of polls that this time we should carry out a movement to create awareness.
I am confident that younger generation voters will register their names in large numbers, they will make their contributions better for our democracy and will further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, on this great land of India many times great men have emerged, such great men have done some magnificent and unforgettable things for the human society.
On January 23, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On the birthday of Netaji, I had a great opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated exclusively for the brave soldiers who contributed to the country's freedom struggle.
Inside the Red Fort, several such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
The closing Red Fort chambers have been transformed into very unique museums, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
The museum, which was established in the memory of India's first freedom struggle of 1857, has dedicated the entire complex to the mantra of 'Granthi Mandir' as a revolutionary temple.
In every brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is enshrined.
It was here that the British government prosecuted India's brave sons Col Brem Siegel, Col. Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
When I was listening to the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of Red Fort, one of Netaji's family gifted me a very special hat.
In fact, we need to bring the bravery and patriotism of our heroes to our new generations again and again in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had given me the opportunity to fly the Triple Talaq at any place 75 years ago.
On this occasion, the announcement regarding the Government of Assam was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and capable administrator.
Such a brave soldier has played an important role in the freedom struggle.
With the slogans of awakening and inspiring spirit like giving me a boost, I give you freedom, Netaji is filled with satisfaction in every Indian.
For many years there was a demand for secret papers on him to be brought public
I am extremely happy that we are doing this work.
I don't really think that all the family members of Netaji came to my house one day.
Together we talked about several things related to Netaji, we offered our tributes to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to upgrade several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum and Grandhi Mantra connected with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share with you an incident related to the life of Netaji in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always considered radio as an important media that connects people.
I have been told that this radio station has been broadcast once a week, which has been broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In the administration of this radio station, M.
R.
Vyas Jis contribution is significant.
Broadcasting programmes on the Azad Hind Radio were very fond of the common people, whose events gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A display museum has been established in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts are being made to describe Indian art and culture in a more attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, with more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amruta Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnidranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Rai and Silos Mukherjee.
I especially urge you all to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering what this is about art, but you might be wondering that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is talking about the excellent works of art.
You all must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev is also a painter.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to his majority works.
He said that the person who sees the picture should himself understand it, and he wanted to see the news given through that picture in his own eyes.
His paintings are displayed in Europe, Russia and America.
I am sure you will go to Granthi Mandir and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of devotees.
Our holy people have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such pilgrim is Chand Ravidas.
Ravidas ji was born on 19th February.
In fact, if God is among all human beings, it is not apt to distinguish him by distinguishing him in the form of caste, creed and creed.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Throughout his entire life, the sacred Ravidas tried to enhance the importance of labour and labour.
It would not be exaggerated if he told the world that he had given the real object of the greatness of labour.
Once again I remember the holy shrine Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, in MyGov, Kiran Siddar ji has been calling upon the Indian Space Department and its future dimensions to speak in Mann Ki Baat.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed immensely to Indias space programme.
Our space programme includes the contribution of countless young scientists of the country.
It is heartening to note that satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are reaching space.
On 24th January, the same Kalamsat was launched by our students.
Even the sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have earned their respect.
In the last four and a half years, the number of space missions that have been launched since independence till 2014.
We have achieved 104 satellites in one spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias existence in the moon through Chandrayaan-2.
Our country is making use of space technology in a very special way for the protection of lifestyles.
Space technology has been providing substantial assistance in the field of cyclones, railways and road safety.
NAVIC devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protect them and help in economic development.
We have been using space technology to enable government service delivery and accountability in a better way.
As per the Housing for All, around 40 lakh households in 23 states have been given geo-take.
Besides, geo-take of nearly three crore properties has also been done under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
Our satellites are the symbols of the growing power of the country today.
We have made excellent contacts with many countries of the world because of its contribution.
There is a unique endeavour called South Asia Satellites, which has given the glory of development to our neighbouring countries.
Through its excellent competitive mobility services, India has launched not only the developed countries but also the satellites of the developed countries.
Heaven and cinema have always been things that attract children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to think greatly, to see what is impossible so far, to move beyond those borders.
Our children are attracted by theaters and inspires them to look for new stars and gives a vision.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whoever plays, they grow, they blossom, this time the sportspersons in Khelo India have brightened.
In January, about 6000 sportspersons participated in 18 games for Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
If a sportsperson at the local level has performed well, he will be able to achieve the best in the world.
This time, sportspersons from all the states of Khelo India have shown their talent.
He lives with his family in a truck-stop bag.
Like her, Captain Sonali Helvee of the Maharastrath's Kabdaik group for women under 21 is residing in Sathara.
He lost his father at a very young age, and his brother and his mother inspired Sonali.
We see that women do not get much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
But beyond all this, Sonali chose Kabbai and did a great job.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Asansol, is proud to have won gold medals at a very young age in sports for young Indians.
Akshatha Vaswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, has won a gold medal in the weightlifting section.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But have you heard of a competition to clean the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is a clean and beautiful toilet.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, people used to beautify them and used some paintings, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, a lot of pictures related to clean toilets are available on social web sites.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and village leaders to take leadership of such a movement in your Panchayat.
Definitely share the picture of your clean toilet with MyIzzatGhar on the social web site.
Friends, together with the aim of cleaning the nation and getting rid of open defecation, we have made a memorable journey on 2nd October 2014.
Today, due to the cooperation of the people of India, today, before the 2nd of October, 2019, we are fast moving towards achieving freedom from open defecation, so that we can dedicate ourselves to him on the 150th birth anniversary of our brother.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat is immense, for this I am happy to share this thing with you that more than five and a half lakh villages and 600 districts have declared that they are free from the habit of open defecation and 98 of rural Indias cleanliness has reached the people and toilets have been provided to nearly 9 crore families.
My little friends, the election days are coming closer.
I have to talk about exam warriors and Anshul Sharma, a resident in Himachal Pradesh, is calling on MyGov.
And they said, Thank you, O you men of Anshua, for the thing which I have put forward.
Yes, the first part of the year is for many families.
Students, from their parents to teachers, are all genuine in the work related to examinations.
Moreover, students from many foreign countries are also participating in the event this time.
I would like to talk to our young friends about all the angles related to the examinations in this Pariksha Bay Certificate, especially the unconscious choices.
I have been urging people to send inputs and comments for this.
I am very happy that people in MyGov are sharing their views in large numbers.
Some of these suggestions and suggestions will be put forward during the Down Hall programme.
You must participate in this program...
You can also see its direct telecast through social media and our App.
May this visit of 2019 be a successful one.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
That is when we get the benefits of experience and self-confidence that we need to do something new.

Electricity has been added to every village of the country.
All the world's prestigious organizations have said that India is getting rid of poverty at the pace of achieving achievement.

India won the Greek Cricket World Cup for 19-year-olds, the world cup for visually impaired persons with disabilities.
This time, India has won medals in the Asian Games.
India has performed very well in the Asian Games.
If I talk about the efforts and social efforts of every Indian then the voice of our mind will be very long and it will be born in 2019.
All this is due to the relentless efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Jayachandran joined Bhagwandi.
People say that he was busy treating patients anytime.
Similarly, Sulkitti Narasamma from Karnataka also joined Bhagwadi on December 25.
Sulakitti Narasamma was helpful in bringing pregnant mothers to labor.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, particularly in remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padma Shri awards.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social initiatives of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Just a few days back, some of our party members told me that some young doctors used to camp in the city to provide free treatment to the poor.
Every month many poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends, who are serving with selflessness, is truly commendable.
Today, I would like to express my pride here that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement due to social efforts.
Just a few days ago, some people had told me that in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people had worked together in the cleanliness drive.
In this magnificence of cleanliness, all sections of the society, NGOs, school-collear students and the people of Jabalpur participated with great enthusiasm.
The success stories about innovative youngsters and entrepreneurs have been specifically described at com.
Well, will we do a job
Will we share information on such websites amongst us
We will spread all the positive sentiments very well.
A large number of people will come to know about our heroes that bring about changes in society.
There is a special importance for sports in all societies.
When playing, it fills the minds of those who see it.
We feel a lot of things like name, identification and respect for sportspersons.
But, sometimes behind them, there are many things that are bigger than the sports world.
I would like to mention about Hannaya Nizar, a girl from Kashmir who has won a gold medal in the Karate competition held in Korea.
Hanaya belongs to the Anantnag area of Kashmir, a 12 year old girl.
Because of the hard work and vigour of Hannaya, Karate had trained and learnt it smoothly and made it a record.
On behalf of all my countrymen, I wish him a bright future.
Hanaya has a lot of good wishes and good wishes.
Like him, there was a lot of news in the media about Rajani, another 16-year-old girl.
Rajani has won gold medals in the junior category in the women's puppet competition.
When Rajani won the medal, he immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani dressed his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, why did Rajani drink a cup of milk, all of you think
He paid homage to his father, Jasmer Singh, who is selling luxury in a shop in Panipat.
Rajani later said that his father had made a lot of sacrifice to achieve this situation and had suffered many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
This year, Vedangi Kulkarni, a 20-year-old young man from Pune, became the first Asian woman to boost the world at a rapid pace.
He traveled 159 days a day at a rate of about 300 km per day.
His unflinching interest in paying a bike is truly commendable.
Isn't there any mourning for us when we hear about such achievements
The names of all these festivals may be different but there is a feeling of celebrating everything that these festivals are somehow connected with harvest and silk, which are mixed with the farmers, which are mixed with the villages and are integrated with crops.
It is time to enter Sun Makara Rasi during the time of sunrise.
Then gradually it starts increasing day by day and it starts harvesting winter crops.
My best wishes to our brothers and sisters who feed us.
The fragrance of unity in diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat spreads smell through our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals are with nature.
Many of our festivals have been specially developed in the spirit of preserving rivers and water.
On the day of Sat Punya, the sun is worshipped in rivers and water bodies.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people bathe in the holy rivers.
Share the photos you took during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is very dimensional, so much divinity is filled with glory.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
People in the Kumbh Mela are mixed with faith and tricks.
On one hand, millions of people from all over the country are connected to each other.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is a fountain of our great cultural heritage.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Mela being organised in Prayagraj, starting 15th January, is looking forward to all of you.
Saints and saints have started coming to Kumbh Mela.
We can calculate its excellent significance from the integration of the Kumbh Mela last year into the INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF HUMANITY, the abominable cultural heritage of humanity.
A few days ago, ambassadors from many countries visited the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At the same time, flags of many countries were flown.
People from more than 150 countries are likely to participate in this Kumbh organized by Prayagraj.
With the divine nature of the Kumbh Mela, India's glory will showcase its magnificence in the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is a great tool to feel oneself, every person who comes here has a different experience, they see and understand the things of the world with a spiritual eye.
This, in particular, provides opportunities for youngsters to experience great learning.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I could see the arrangements for Kumbh fair being held very critically.
People from Prayagraj are very enthusiastic about the Kumbh Mela.
There I dedicated the Integrated Command  Control Centre, the Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people.
It will also reach out to the remotest areas of the country where cleanliness is maintained with difficulty in the arrangements.
This time devotees can also observe the sacred sight of Akshayavad after a sacred bath at the Sangam.
This is a symbol of the faith of the people that has been stuck in the fort for thousands of years, so that even if the devotees wanted it could not be observed.
Now the doors of Akshayavada have been opened for all.
May this spiritual Kumbh become the glory of Indian philosophy.
May this pillar of hope become the glory of the nation.
Whether it be the glory of national unity or be it the glory of the devotees or be it the glory of the world tourists.

Do you know what Mandela said about her brother

My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a conclave of Director Generals of Police at Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where there was an interactive discussion with the top police officers of the country.

My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, the holy birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Govind Singh was born in Patna.
Until a large part of his life, his work was in North India, and he joined the land of Maharastra.
Patna, the birthplace, the activity of North India and the final moments of life.
In a way, the whole of India has got his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
But whenever there were attempts to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, injustice was committed to them, Guru Gobind Singh ji shouted slogans for the poor and the weak, firmly fought shoulder to shoulder so that he used to say: awa Lagse Ek Ladaum, Sidion Son Main Baz Tudaum, Thabe Gobind Singh Nama Gah.
He said, "Conflicting with the weak cannot express their power.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji considered it a great service to alleviate the sufferings of humanity.
He was a well-known personality of valour, heroism, martyrdom and guidance.
Apart from this, Gurumukhi, Brajbasha, Samskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were experts in many languages.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
My dear countrymen, there are several events that have not been much debated in the country.
FSSAI's a different attempt.

My dear countrymen, this is the closing ceremony of 2018, we will reunite ourselves in 2019, we will renew our hearts.
Whether individual life or in the life of the nation or in the life of the society, inspiration is the source of development.
Come, let us inspire new inspiration, new zeal, new zeal, new triumphs and new heights.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadasamith Trinity, we all made a journey together with the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, most of the letters and telephone calls from you have come in connection with this 50th part.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Patna, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from NarendraModi App, Delhi, Brasenjit Sarkar from Birthwan, West Bengal and Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur have raised the same question.
Your interest is natural.
In today's era, after nearly forgotten radio, why does Modi connect through radio
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working as the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
And he said, Take a lad that was kept in a vessel of cannon from him, and first eat the ladder before it is ready.
I was wondering why, I asked if there was a wedding in the house.
No, brother, don't you know
I'm supposed to explain.
Look, let us listen to the radio for the first time.
They were talking about it on radio.
In this forest, in such an unpopular area, amidst snowy mountains, an ordinary man sells his own tea and asks for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, it is not surprising that when I was the Prime Minister, I turned my attention to the most powerful media radio.
The spirit of Mann Ki Baat has been inspired by the urge to take young professionals from far-flung villages to cities of the country.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, telephone calls were heard, apps and MyGov were criticised
The journey of these 50 regions, which have been connected with all these things in one corner and have been given in an interesting manner, we have collectively covered this journey.
At present, several Indian radio and Mann Ki Baat have also been conducted.
Some of the meetings are very interesting.
As many as 70 percent of those who have been analyzed are constantly calling for a sound of mind.
Greater people consider the creative emotions of the society as a major contributor to Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat has encouraged mass movements in a big way.
There has been widespread discussion about indipositiveness.
All these underscore the positive emotions and honesty of our countrymen.
People share their feelings that the spirit of self-confidence has increased due to the voice of the mind.
It is a big change in the minds of the people that they want to join social service.
But people are not only connected with this event with the skin.
Besides television, F Emmanoli, Mobile, Internet, Facebook, Direct Broadcasting, Pariscope, the people of Mann Ki Baat are also making their contributions through the NarendraModi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stalwarts of Mann Ki Baat for turning Mann Ki Baat into a party.
Your doubts are correct.
At the end of their analysis, it was also a decision that this event was unpolitical.
When Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that Modi should not be seen anywhere.
The neighbours' expectations were evident in the letters, comments and telephone calls that appeared in front of every Mann Ki Baat.
Modi will come, he will go, but this country will remain forever and will not be destroyed by our culture.
Small stories of 130 crore Indians will also be hidden.
I read the letter, if the same feeling had appeared in another letter, I would also take it along.
I also share my experience with you.
There cannot be any government that has the power to spread awareness and spread awareness from a small village in Ariana to spread across the country and abroad.
When every section of the society and its familiarity are associated with a new interpretation of social change, todays generation understands it and there is an unconscious awareness.
The essence of India's social justice is about social power.
There are thousands of dimensions of social life, one of which is political.
If politics becomes everything, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes, the extent to which political events and politicians dominate, the various capabilities and efforts of the society are suppressed.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
In a way, you have been asked because of your consent.
If I have to answer directly to the question you asked me, I will not engage in any preparation of the Muslims.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple job for me.
People's letters are coming in front of every heartbeat.
That letter is not just a paper for me
Indeed, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint, I have gone to most parts of the country, I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
To tell the truth, in the voice of the mind, the voice is mine, but the examples, emotions and sentiments are all of my countrymen.
I have not yet been able to mention the names of lakhs of such people in Mann Ki Baat, but they are sending their letters and comments without disappointment.
I have full confidence that your thoughts will contribute to making me more interesting and more dangerous than ever before.
Efforts are being made to make the letters and comments related to the letters which have not been made in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social infrastructure.
In that context, they are transforming into Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude to all of them for their capabilities and capabilities.
I appeal to all of you that you must listen to this event in your state languages.
No political media will ever have happiness, very little coverage, and that too is negative.
But the media made themselves aware of the various things raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Innovative methods of cleanliness, road safety, non-vegetarian India and a cell phone with daughters have been used by the media to transform them into a movement.
If you had no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been unfulfilled.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
To tell the truth, I have no secret.
It makes it easier to understand anyone unless the ancient consequences of our lives are eradicated.
On several occasions, we talk about the gap between the elderly and the elderly in the family and those in the adult age.
In fact, most of the adults have little to talk to the adults.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through exclusive events or social networks.
I have always been trying to learn from what they do or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to give a lot of importance to the efforts of the youngsters.
But I believe that there is no time for the youth to waste and this thing helps the younger generation in creating more innovations because they want to finish things quickly.
It seems to us that today's youngsters are more talented and think about big things.
Well, let them realise great dreams and achieve great successes.
Some say that younger generations are going to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking, what can this be wrong
The sellers are doing a lot of work at the same time.
If we take our vision around us, be it social entrepreneurs, start-ups, sports and other sectors, youth who make a big difference in the society.
These youngsters start questioning and have the ability to dream.
If we keep the thoughts of youngsters on earth, if we provide an independent environment to shape them then we can bring a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, I urge you all from Gurugram to Vinita on MyGov, to speak on the occasion of the 26th Constitution Day tomorrow.
He further said that in the 70th year of our adoption of our Constitution, we are retaining our legacy.
Vineetha ji, grateful for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is the day we see the great men who gave us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It has been 2 years, 11 months and 17 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this legitimate task of laying down the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these gentlemen have forgotten such a broad and deep constitutional law.
The rapid pace they have enacted in the constitution of the Constitution, is still an example of time management and productivity.
We also motivate to complete the scheduled time to make our responsibilities a reality.
The salient features of our Constitution are the detailed description of rights and duties.
It is a memorable occasion for youngsters to raise awareness about the Constitution and link them with various aspects of the Constitution.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years of our journey and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us all take the values of our Constitution forward and ensure peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, it should not be forgotten that part of that gentleman who was the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
That gentleman is an admirer.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas is December 6, i. e.
I offer my homage to Baba Saheb on behalf of all the people of the country, and he enjoyed the right to live with dignity and dignity of crores of Indians.
Democracy is blended with the nature of Baba Saheb and Indias democratic values are not imported from outside, he added.
What is democracy, what is a parliamentary system is not a new thing for India.
Once again my hallowed homage to Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji was celebrated and next year, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of human welfare.
He always underlined the path of duty, work, service, compassion and brotherhood in the society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been asked to observe this festival very well.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
Moreover, a train will be constructed along the holy places associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Now, when I participated in a meeting related to it, I was reminded of Bhagat Saheb Gurudwara.
The Gurudwara suffered a major impact during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But it is still an example today that the state government has revived it in collaboration with those circles.
My Ladies and Gentlemen, after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the voice of Mann Ki Baat and for the first time I have got the opportunity to unveil the feelings of Mann Ki Baat before you.
The more I join you, the more our journey will be deeper, it will be a pleasure for everyone.
The question of what I got from Mann Ki Baat can be raised in some people's minds.
Today, I would like to say that the receptions that I have received through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, one of them touches my heart, while all the family members sit together and listen to the voices of Mann Ki Baat, our family leader sits among us and shares our thoughts with us.
Your comforts, my vows.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your anointings are my anointings.
Come, let us take this journey further.
Thanks a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, October, 2018
The coming October 31 is the birth anniversary of our noble Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the Ekta Radio programme.
The climate is like this.
Therefore, I would like to urge a large number of people to participate in the movement of unity.
About six months before the independence of the country, on January 27, 1947, the world famous international journal Time appeared on its front page with a photograph of Sardar Patel.
The newspaper also published a map of India
But the map doesn't look like it's still there.
In that map, India showed a piece of silver.
It contained more than 550 estates.
When they left the country, India was thinking of having a variety of pieces.
The Times commented that India faces various threats such as separation, violence, food shortages, rising prices and power politics.
The newspaper noted that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel could only help in integrating the nation and healing the wounds of the people.
The article also describes the other side of biography of India's iron man.
The article included his handling of relief operations during the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920 and his conduct of the Burdoli Satyagraha.
His honesty and determination was so much that he would have full faith in him from farmers, workers to industrialists.
Sardar Patel resolved every issue in order to integrate the country, just as he slashed the garb through a single-linked print.
He ensured that all the destinations in the country are connected with a united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad, Thinkur or Samasthan in Rajasthan, if we see an integrated India then it is the main reason for Sardar Patel's magnificence and foresight.
Built on the Narmada bank of Gujarat, this statue is double the height of the statue of independent goddess of America.
This will be the highest statue in the world.
Every Indian will be proud to see the world's tallest statue in India.
Sardar Patel, the real brother of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I am confident that this statue, which has made Indian mother India proud, will make every Indian proud.
It is natural that every Indian has a desire to see a statue of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place for people from all over the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated 'Kalaad Bada Divas'.
I salute everyone who is a part of Indias security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must know what we are celebrating today as a day of sacrifice.
Indian troops today took a foothold in Kashmir and saved the valley from being caught by the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview with our respected army officer Shaam Manekshaw.
Feeled Marshal Sham Manekshah recalled his time when he was Karnal.
It was at that time that military operations began in Kashmir.
In a meeting held at the time, Field Marshal Manekshaw noted how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had reprimanded him for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, and pointed out that there should be no delay in sending troops and that the problem should be resolved quickly and Sardar Patel gave clear instructions to him.
After this, if our forces flew to Kashmir then we can see how our army worked successfully.
The commemoration of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on 31st October.
Let us pay our respects to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who are those who do not want to sports
If the youth of our country have these qualifications then our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technology but also explore pride in the field of sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them, their determination to break barriers and achieve success will be a source of inspiration for all of our people.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Youth Summer Olympics in Argentina.
You will be aware that the performance of our youth in the summer Olympics of 2018 has been immensely remarkable.
We got 13 medals in this competition and three medals in the mixed dual segment.
You must remember that the recent Asian sportspersons had a very good performance.
You must have noticed that I have often referred to the word 'Magnificent or unprecedented achievement'.
This is a reality reflecting the progress being made in the sports sector of India every day.
India is making new achievements not only in sports but also in numerous sectors.
For example, I would like to indicate to you the disabled sportsperson, Narayan Thakur, who won the Gold in the 2018 Asian Games for Persons with Disabilities.
He is a congenital person.
When he was only eight, he lost his father.
He then lived in the house for eight years.
After leaving the house, he used to clean Delhi Transport Corporation buses and work in roadside restaurants.
It is Narayan who won medals on behalf of India in international competitions.
Besides, it should also be noted that how fast the Indian sports sector is attaining.
Moreover, India has not won medals either in Junior or Senior category in the Judo competition.
But in the Youth Olympics, India's Tapabi Devi won a silver medal and made a historic achievement.
Tababi Devi is 16 years old and is a resident of a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker and mother is doing fish business.
It's a time when there's no money to buy food.
Despite such a poor condition, his passion and dedication have not diminished.
He has won medals for the country and has a history.
The entire world praised the competition for a very successful one.
The World Cup for FIFA 17-year-olds has achieved a record number of eyewitnesses in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football competitions in sports hubs in different parts of the country.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host the 2018 World Cup men's hockey competition in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup hockey competition is scheduled to be held from November 28 to December 16.
Every Indian will definitely be interested in the hockey competition, whether he plays any game or is interested in any game.
In the Hockey Games, India has achieved records of golden compositions.
India has won gold medals in various competitions and has won world championships once.
India has also created a lot of excellent hockey players.
Whenever you quote about the hockey game, you cannot finish it without mentioning our achievements.
Major Diyan Chand, considered to be the Father of Hockey, is known all over the world.
Further, Indian hockey has a long tradition from Uthamsingh to Dhanrajpalli, Leslie Claudius Mohammad Shahid.
Even now, the Indian team is encouraging the younger generation by looking at their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the best competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage the Indian team and every soldier to play there.
The state of Odisha has a great historical background and has a rich cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very fond of it.
This is a unique opportunity for sportspersons to visit Odisha.
One can also enjoy sports competitions along with world famous hill stations like Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake.
I convey my best wishes to the participating Indian mens team and also assure them that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
My best wishes to all the stakeholders from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the spirit of those who have come forward to serve the society is indeed a source of inspiration and enthusiasm for all the people of the country.
But in the present new era, the new generations are revived and enthused with innovative methods to fulfil their dreams.
I participated in the opening ceremony of a new portal called "May for Community", which has been launched by my Government and the IT and Electronics Industry of the country to provide opportunities for the workers to work in this field for the purpose of encouraging social activities.
Their dedication, courage and valour will make every Indian proud.
The change that we are, from individuals to individuals, has created a new ecosystem for social work among IT departments.
Some people give lessons to older people.
Some people have dedicated themselves to the cause of cleanliness and others have helped the farmers.
However, behind their actions, there is no perspective, they are inspired by their determination.
But a person who can sit in the chair and learn to play basket games can also help the disabled persons who participate in the role of a wheelchair basket and disabled sports person.
This feeling and dedication is a work-frame.
It will make every Indian proud.
"No, we will certainly inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when you saw your suggestions on todays Mann Ki Baat, the idea of Puducherry was very encouraging.
The Mann Ki Baat App has said that the tribal people, their traditions and singings are a fitting example of nature.
He added that how tribal traditions can be pursued in our lives and achieved sustainable development and what can be known from such traditions.
I congratulate you for presenting this issue among the leaders of Manish and Mann Ki Baat programme.
It will inspire us to know our dignified past and ancient traditions when the entire world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and exploring new ways to pursue a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is facing the same problem.
However, we need to address this thing that we remember our past and we need to understand our traditional values, especially the way we live in our tribal people.
It is an integral part of our tribal peoples lives in close cooperation with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, vegetation and flowers as gods.
Bhil tribals in Central India, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are planting peepal and Arjun trees.
Bishnoi classes living in the desert areas of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
In particular, they are ready to give their lives rather than damage to a tree.
The Mishmi tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh are closely associated with the LTTE.
They regard the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
The LTTE is also a forest guard in Nagaland.
The people of Warli in Maharashtra regard the LTTE as their guests, and they regard it as a reflection of their prosperity.
Central India's gulf race feels that the LTTE is a direct link to their lives and that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be hungry.
Central India's millions of people stop fishing in the Kaitan river during the period of fishing.
They consider the area as a sanctuary of fishes and think that nutritious fish will be sufficiently available because of this belief among them.
The tribal people also build their habitats with strong and environment friendly natural products.
In some individuals living in the Nilgiri mountain ranges of southern India, the Dhodar community is building their habitations only with the goods available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony to the fact that the tribal people believe in living in a very peaceful and harmonious manner and if someone seeks to harm or harm their natural resources, they will not hesitate to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters are tribal communities.
No one can forget Lord Birsa Munda, who fought hard against British imperialism to defend their forests.
In addition to what I have mentioned so far, we can list a large number of tribal communities who have taught us how to co-exist with nature and we are deeply grateful to our tribal people for continuing the forest cover in the country.
Everyone should come forward to express their gratitude.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we have mentioned the individuals and organisations that have played a very important role in society.
However, all these works are not enough, but they have inspired the deepest emotions of our thinking to show a new way to work for the society.
A few days ago, I had read about the farmer brothers of Panchayat Kurbachan Singh.
The marriage of the son of the hardworking farmer brother Kurbachan Singh will take place.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told the bridegroom's parents that the wedding should be held in a very simple manner.
He said there is no need to spend huge amounts for wedding reception or any other matter.
He said that this should be regarded as a very simple one, but he suddenly imposed a condition.
The condition is that a female householder should ensure that they will not burn straw and agricultural waste in their lands.
You should think well about the social strength of this idea.
But it shows how high his quality is, how many families in our society feel that how they solve their personal problems in a way that can benefit the entire society.
The family members of Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh have shown us such an example.
I also read about Kalarmajra village near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning the steel, the village of Kalarmajra came to light by farmers who followed the new technique of soil-dripping them.
Congratulations to Kurbachan Singh
Congratulations to the people of Kamarmajra village and all those who have not been able to pollute in their surroundings.
You all are the real guides to a healthy lifestyle that takes Indias tradition forward.
As the ocean is formed by the consolidation of small drops of water, every positive activity is required to create a good environment.
My countrymen, this is what our ancient legends say: God, in all three worlds, there must be peace around us in all creations of water, air, land, fire, breath, medicine, vegetation, gardens and deep depths.
Every soul within me and within you, every heart and this grandeur must have peace everywhere.
Om Shanti . Shanti .
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved by gold.
As far as India is concerned, this year is of special significance on November 11, because the First World War ended on November 11, a hundred years ago.
It makes us feel that hundred years after the end of that war, the catastrophe and humanitarian casualties have come to an end.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection with that war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely in that war and made great sacrifices.
Indian soldiers have also pointed out that whenever there is a war, Indians are not victims of anybody.
Our soldiers have expressed their courage and courage in difficult areas and in bad weather.
The only objective was to create peace.
This world knows that there was a great number of deaths and goods during the First World War.
It is reported that nearly one crore soldiers and equally innocent people have died.
This is what the entire world has realized the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed over the last hundred years.
Today, peace is not only a war, but global cooperation and coordination are needed to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poor is a real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our north-eastern states have a special significance.
There is no link between the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states - the people of this region are very talented.
NE States are now famous for their excellent work.
The North-Eastern region has progressed significantly in organic farming.
In order to promote sustainable food, the State of Sikkim received the Golden Prize for the 2018 precious future policy a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim won the award by postponing the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim for this.
I believe that such festivals will provide an opportunity to adopt new pledges.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop then this country will also grow.
My best wishes to all of you.
