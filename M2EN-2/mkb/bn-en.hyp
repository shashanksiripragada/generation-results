Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Many congratulations to all of you on the occasion of Deepawali.
Deepajournmost in the Enemy Building.
What a beautiful message.
At present, Deepawali is celebrated across the world.
Not only Indians are involved in this festival, but the government of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate the Deepawali Festival with joy.
A kind of India is built there.
Friends, Festival tourism has a unique attraction in the world.
Our India is a country of festivals, where there is a great opportunity for tourism.
We should strive to promote Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and also include people from other states and other countries in this joy.
We have so many festivals in every state and every region that people of other countries are keen on these festivals.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important for the development of festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had decided to make something different on this occasion.
I had said - Come, let us all celebrate the strength of Indian women and their success in this Deepawali, that is, we respect the Laxmi of India.
Immediately after seeing this, there is a lot of inspirational stories in the Sysol media.
Warrenal's Kodipaka Ramesh, Namo App wrote: My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we have five brothers in good livelihood.
My mother is my God.
My dear countrymen, if you look at myself then he is India's Laxmi.
Rameshji, my blessings to your mother.
He was addressing the gathering at the tournament by Major Khushboo Kair Bharati Laxmi, the daughter of the bus conductor and led by the women forces of Assam Rifles.
Her daughter to poet Tiwari is India's Laxmi, who is also her power.
He's proud that his daughter painted a very good picture, and took a very good place in Clatt's exams.
Again, Mega Jain wrote: A 92 year old woman has been donating water to the railway station in Gualior for many years.
Megaji, India has been inspired by the humble nature and compassion of this Laxmi.
Many of these stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire and share some things around you.
My best wishes to all these lacs of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous woman poet Sachi Honnamma of the 17th century wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The same feeling is that India's goddess whom we are talking about, it seems that the vast majority of them had been elected in the seventeenth century.
Peninanda Permegandanu Himavantu, Peninanda Vrinda Vrinda Vrinda Vrindavaninda Janakrayanu Jaswadenu means Himavantu meaning Parvati, the prince is famous for his daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu is famous for her daughter Lakshmi and the public is famous for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future in our society through the great work of our pride and our daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is spread not only in India but in the whole world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my Gurudwara journey in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you but it will take a lot of time for this thing.
He has always placed serving work above everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji used to believe that selfless service is invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has conveyed his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most visitors of his time.
He had visited many places and wherever he had won the hearts of all through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji has travelled to many important religious places.
It is said that the well-known saint of Assam, Shankardev, was inspired by his ideals.
He also traveled to the holy land of Haridder.
During his visit to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
Videre, Guru Nanak Devji is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of his words.
At a time when Guru Nanak ji had travelled north Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This established a strong relationship between the Sikh religion followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had also visited Tibet and he was accepted as a Guru.
He also traveled to Uzbekistan and there too he was worshipped.
And during an austerity, he travelled widely to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lived in the hearts of lakhs of people, who followed his teachings with full faith and devotion.
And this journey was organised to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all those princes, along with the Golden Temple philosophy, had the opportunity to know about Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who bound the country in harmony.
Just like Sardar Patel had the surprising power to gather people, he was able to coordinate with those who showed ideological differences.
Sardar Patel also looked into the microscopic issues closely and looked at the exams.
In this context, he was a man of detail.
He was also a part of organisational skills.
He was specially skilled in planning and designing strategy.
When we read or hear about Sardar Saheb's methodology, we can see how extraordinary it was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country attended the Ahmedabad session of the Congress.
He ensures that no one suffers from water.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
Look again, the sale of khadi has increased a lot.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution.
He does an important task of ensuring our fundamental rights, so that there is no possibility of discrimination based on caste or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Minister of State for Home Affairs of India, had done a historic and great job of uniting the segments and territories of the country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a special feature that none of his vision would have been observed.
On one hand, his vision was centered on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
So far southern Lakshadweep had not avoided his goal.
Indeed, when we mention Sardar Patel's efforts, we discuss his role only in certain parts of the country.
Like Lakshadweep also he played an important role in the smaller part .
Immediately after getting this news, without delay, Sardar Patel took immediate steps.
He sent instructions to the brothers of Mudalia , architect Ramswami Mudaliar and architect Laxmanswamy Mudali that taking along with the residents of Trevankar they immediately hoisted the national flag there .
According to his instructions, the shores were immediately lifted and the neighbours were confined to the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the brothers and sisters of Mudali that they personally ensured that the development of Lakshadweep has all the support.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing immensely to the progress of India.
It is an attractive tourist destination and bottom .
I hope you go to this beautiful island and their shores.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October 2018 is dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's longest human statue.
It's twice America's Statue of Liberty.
The tallest statue of the world fills the hearts of every Indian with pride -LRB- as Indian the heart gets filled with pride when it feels that the world 's longest clay is established in our country -RRB- .
Every Indian 's head got higher in spirituality .
You will be happy to know that in one year only 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity .
That is, everyday about eight and a half thousand people took the pride of this Statue of Unity.
For Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the faith that he has in his heart, that is extraordinary.
Now there are several attractions like cactus gardens , vegetation parks , wild safaris , child nutrition parks , singular nurseries and for this the local economy is growing and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being provided for hostel or housing hospitality facilities.
Local people have started cultivating dragon fruits and I firmly believe that this will be the main means of achieving their livelihood.
Friends, For the country, for every state, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
How can we witness that within a year only one place become a world famous tourist spot where people from within the country and abroad come .
Transportation system, accommodation, presence of guides, environment friendly systems - each one after the other is progressing.
Very big economic development has started and local people are innovating the services of the tourists as per their needs .
The government is fulfilling its obligation.
Friends , is there any such Indian who will not be proud to know that a few days back Time magazine has placed this Statue of Unity in the top of the world among the 100 best tourist spots .
I hope all of you will take a little nap from your precious time to see this Statue of Unity , but I am very happy that every Indian who leaves for a ride , he goes to roam around at least fifteen destinations of the country and stays there at night .
Friends, you are aware that every year from 2014, 31st October is being celebrated as National Unity Day.
This day conveys the message of unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
RAN for Unity is being organised today.
This will include people from all walks of life.
Running, mind and body are beneficial for both.
I hope that all of you will participate in the 31st of October - the unity of the country and the goal of keeping your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had binded the country on the basis of unity.
This mantra of unity is a reflection of our lives and should strive to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, at every level in diverse countries like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in strengthening the country's unity and concerns.
There will be many examples around us who are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their words get mixed with our memories very soon.
Friends, I recall the month of September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had passed a judgment on the birthplace of Ram.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi was also assassinated on this day.
Today, my dear countrymen, if a story is heard in every house, every village, from the east to the west, from the north to the south, from every part of India then it is cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village is keen to talk about my joyous experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of 100 crore Indians.
Therefore, the beneficiaries of this scheme are hundred crore Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I've heard and I want to hear you.
In such a difficult situation, it is no less valour than being in such adversity.
In such a terrible situation, our fearless soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by brave-hearts, they are also running the Swachh Siachen Abhiyan.
There's nothing so cold in there.
In such a scenario, it is an important task to separate waste and manage waste.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier that is a source of river and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at one such place means ensuring access to clean water for those living in low-lying areas and using rivers like Nubra and Syok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is such a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepavali, specially some new things are being purchased from the market.
I once said we tried to buy local goods.
If we get the things we need in our village, we don't have to go to the shrine.
If you get the money, you don't have to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local items, the more Gandhi 150 will turn you into a grand festival.
And I always urge that we don't have a leather hand, we should buy something that is made by our Khadi workers.
Even in Deepawali, before Deepawali, many people have bought a lot, but there are people who believe that if Deepawali falls, things may be cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who still have to buy.
Therefore, with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would like to appeal to you people to come here for local reasons and buy local goods.
Look, we can also play an important role in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this occasion of Deepavali.
Like everybody in Deepawali, we use bets.
But sometimes there's a strange fire.
Sometimes he gets hurt.
I urge all of you to be careful and celebrate the festival with great fervour.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
I mean, but, September 2018
Is there any Indian who does not feel proud of our armed forces and the soldiers of our army
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We have recalled that in 2016, the Surgical Strike in 1966, when our armed forces responded to the proxy wire in the name of counter-terrorism.
Our Armed Forces have organized exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lions can feel the strength of the people, especially the younger generation of the country, how capable we are and how our armed forces can protect our lives.
Days like Parakram Parv highlighted the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces for the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a function at Jodhpur, Rajasthan on the land of brave warriors.
It is certain that our armies will give a befitting reply to all those who want to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
But he respectfully and does not appreciate the sovereignty of the country.
India is always committed and committed to maintaining peace and stability.
In the two World Wars of the 19th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace. This is the war that we had no connection with.
Our vision has never fallen on any other country.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on 23 September, we recalled the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancer who freed Haifa from the attackers on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa war in Israel.
This was also a culmination of our soldiers for peacekeeping.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of UN peacekeeping forces.
Our brave soldiers have been wearing blue helmet for decades and the world's peacekeeping system has been playing an important role in the cause of Kaim.
My dear countrymen, our energy is incomparable.
On the occasion of Republic Day, the most keen interest of the people is the Fly Past, which showcases the unprecedented architecture and strength of our Air Force.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1947, when Pakistani invaders launched an unprecedented attack, the Air Force ensured that Indian forces and warships reached the battlefield in time to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force should have responded to the enemy in the war in 1957.
Who doesn't know about Bangladeshi Bangladeshi Bangladeshi Bangladesh
The Air Force played a very important role in liberating Kargil from the intruders in 1999.
The Air Force deployed them by continuously bombarding the enemy base at Tiger Hill.
The entire nation is grateful to them for the significant role played by the Air Force in the rescue and rescue operations.
Air Force contributes to combat natural calamities like storms, storms, floods or terrible earthquakes and assisting the people of the country.
The Air Force has set an example to ensure the equality of women and men in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments to the daughters of the country.
Now, I am giving the opportunity to select the options of the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission of the Air Force which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that the Indian Armed Forces have not only men's strength but also women's participation is increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried about how to save her.
You must know that Abhilash Tommy is a fearless, courageous and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash was the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
For 80 days, while participating in the Golden Globe Race in the South of the Indian Ocean, he was fast moving into a terrible sea storm.
With such a terrible danger, he told me to make such a brave thing...
I pray for the speedy recovery of Abhilash Tomy and hope that his courage, courage and determination will inspire and encourage the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, children also know the importance of 2nd October.
This year, it has a special significance.
We are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the next two years.
The consciousness and consciousness of Mahatma Gandhi has reached the world today.
Like Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, all the sages have gained strength from Gandhijis vision and struggled for equal rights and dignity of the nation.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss with you one more important work of revered Bapu which all the countrymen need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started integrating some thoughts as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1964, Gandhiji had revised his thoughts.
The revered Bapu ji gave his thoughts to the countrymen regarding the rights of the farmers, the people of the villages and the labourers, to protect their rights, to promote cleanliness and education, which is also called the Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public communicator.
Meeting with the people is the speciality of Bapu whom he had adopted.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the people aware that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He gave this realisation an extremely popular movement which was his greatest contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society had dedicated themselves to Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which we know is Gandhijis magic mantra.
Gandhiji had said, I am talking about such a trick whenever you have doubts about it or when you feel arrogant then remember my thoughts.
Remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen in your life and ask yourself a question: how much will it be for that person
Does it mean that crores of people who are hungry and unhappy will win Swaraj
Then you'll see that your doubts have been solved and arrogant circles have come.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhiji's strategies is equally important today.
Financial power and purchasing power of the country's growing middle class are enormous today.
If that benefit reaches the poor, then my happiness will increase manifold.
Keeping in mind this strategy of Gandhiji, whenever we buy something or the other, we must take care of Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, that every purchase of our countrymen may benefit from it and those who have sweat in the production of goods, those who have invested in it, those who have made use of their talent should have some benefits.
I believe that a small step of yours can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we may feel that through this small task we can contribute to the economic progress of our country, to the economic empowerment of our country, to strengthen the fight against poverty.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era, this is the tribute to the revered Bapu.
Think of buying khadi and handicrafts on a special occasion.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji with revered Bapu.
Shastri ji's name has been enlightened, that is, an infinite reverence is born in our hearts.
His beauty always fills the hearts of every countrymen with pride.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very soft from outside but he was firm in his heart.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the director of his great personality.
In a short span of nearly a year and a half, he has given the mantra to summit the achievements of the youth and farmers of the country, which is his self-interest towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate cleanliness to the children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school where the foundation was laid by the revered father himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate world have all contributed to the cause of Swachhata.
I sincerely congratulate all the Swachhata loved ones for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Greetings, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I especially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but all over the world.
This time India is organizing the worlds largest Swachhata Sammelan Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officials from all over the world and experts from all over the world will come and share their experiments and experiences on Swachhata.
It is essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, persecuted and deprived people.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on October 12, 2006.
In a few days, the NHRC will complete twenty-five years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights, but also helped to increase spiritual pride.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister Prayat Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that we do not have any foreign idea of human rights.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ethical principles of the ethical era are decorated with "All Buildings Success".
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
During the twenty-five year visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I think it is very optimistic for a healthy society, democratic values.
Now, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up with the objective of working on human rights at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year also, we have tried to organize the Run for Unity in our villages, cities, metropolitan cities.
Run for unity is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country forever.
I would like to urge all of you that on 31st October, through the "Run for Unity", we will strengthen this effort to unite every section of the society, every individual and that will be his reverence.
My dear countrymen, I sincerely convey my best wishes to all of you for the auspicious festival of Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijaya Dashami.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating Rakhibandhan Festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan is a symbol of love and faith of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are several such events in the history of the country, when we have seen a defence bond that binds the people of two states or different religions with faith.
Just a few days later, Janmastami.
Hearing the winds of 'Hathi horse sail Ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal Ki' and 'Govinda-Govinda' will be heard in the sky.
It's a different joy to drew yourself in the color of Krishna.
Children must have started organizing 'Dahi-Handi' in different parts of the country, especially Maharashtra.
I am grateful to Mr. Chinmayee for taking this into account.
Friends, Apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Diwas.
I congratulate all those people who have been working to save, promote and deliver this great heritage.
Every language has its own importance.
In Sanskrit language and literature, there is a vast pool of knowledge that can be used in every sphere of life.
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, scientific or architecture or be it management or be it economics or be it environment or be it global warming or be it science or be it science or be it science or be it agriculture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it management or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it architecture or be it economics or be it environment or be it an environment
You will be happy to know that all the people of Mattu village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as the medium of conversation today.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the unfinished words can be built.
We use English quotations to weigh something, sometimes shirts etc.
But those who are familiar with the well-known words of Sanskrit, they know that the exact explanation of the subject can be made through these descriptive words of Sanskrit.
I mean, if a guru gives his disciple a letter of knowledge, then there is no such thing or wealth in the world that can repay the disciple Guru's debt.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always remember the great philosophy and former President of India, Bharat Ratna, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
Teachers Day was celebrated across the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and recall his dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers, who have worked hard, are happy to know about the rains.
Just a few days ago, we saw how the floods caused the lives of the people of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come to Kerala.
I convey my deepest condolences to all those families who have lost their loved ones in this calamity.
I would like to assure all the bereaved families that 125 crore Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder in this unfortunate day.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity, get immense health.
I have full faith that Kerala's public life will soon become normal with indomitable zeal and courage.
The way disaster destroys the lives of the people is extremely unfortunate, but in this unfortunate day we also realize the religion of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, every person is trying his best to make the peoples lives normal in Kerala or in any district or region of India.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their support.
Everyone is wondering how the sufferings of the people of Kerala can be shared with them.
We all know that the armed security forces are the heroes of the Kerala disaster.
They have taken all measures to save the flood victims.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BS-F, CI-S-F and RAF have been busy carrying out rescue operations and relief operations.
I would like to particularly mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked in dealing with these dangers, they are particularly appreciative.
The power of NDRF, their commitment and the ability to make the situation sustainable has created a revered seat in the minds of all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while reading the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen that most of the people have written about this thing, our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
From Ghaziabad to Kirti, from Sonipat to Soti Batta, brother Praveen from Kerala, from West Bengal to Dr. Swapan Banerjee, from Katihar in Bihar to Akhilesh Panda and many others have requested me to tell about the various aspects of Atal ji's life in the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On the 16th of August, the people of the country and the world have conveyed their deepest condolences for the demise of Atal ji.
He is a leader who quit the Prime Minister's post 14 years ago and went far away from active politics in the last ten years.
She wouldn't have seen much in the news.
The affection, reverence and condolence for Atal ji is the mantra of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I would like to tell you about one more example of Atal ji's great personality: the Political Culture that he has tried to bring about changes in the Political Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Academic Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brings about two important changes in our country's politics.
The first is to limit the Ministers of States to fifteen percent of the total assembly seats.
Atal ji brought about changes in this system, which will result in saving of money and resources, efficiency and efficiency.
Atal ji was the only visionary to change the situation and promote healthy and smooth governance in politics.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from five in the afternoon to eleven in the morning.
Another Azadi, we have gained from Atal ji's work by creating Indian Flag Code.
It is applied from 2003, thereby enabling tricolor to explode in public places.
Normal Indians get an opportunity to unfurl the National Flag.
In this way, he brings our beloved Tiranga to the people.
You have seen how Atal ji has strengthened the country with the daring steps taken in the election of the people by bringing about changes in the electoral process.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, there is a talk of disruption and hostility, but when something good happens, there is no discussion about it.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
Lok Sabha has passed 21st and Rajya Sabha 14th Bill, as a result of which all MPs have tried to make maximum use of the Assembly by abandoning their party interests.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered for social justice and youth.
Several important bills have been passed for the betterment of youth and backward classes in this session.
You all are aware that for decades, there has been a demand for setting up of an OBC Commission like the SCST Commission.
In order to ensure backward class rights, the country has fulfilled the resolution of the OBC Commission this time and has given a constitutional right to this institution.
This will help in achieving the objective of social justice.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and United Kingdom on Cooperation in the field of Traditional Systems of Medicine.
The Act will further safeguard the interests of the people of SC and ST category.
At the same time, it will protect them from atrocities and enhance their confidence.
No civil society can blame any injustice to women of the country.
The perpetrators of this crime will be punished for at least 10 years, if raped less than 12 years of age, they will be sentenced to death.
You might have read in the newspaper a few days ago, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of hearing, heard the sentence of two offenders being hanged for raping a girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh sentenced the culprits to death after hearing for just five days.
A court in Rajasthan has also taken such a fast decision.
The Act will play a constructive role in resolving the offences against women and girls.
Financial progress is incomplete without social change.
The Third Talaq Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, although it was not possible to pass in the Rajya Sabha, I would like to assure Muslim women that the entire nation stands with all the strengths to bring justice to them.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country then we can bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the deprived and the deprived.
In the current monsoon session, all of us have set a model together.
I sincerely thank all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this moment, we are committed to the Asian Games organized to showcase the vision of millions and millions of people.
Every morning, in newspapers, television, news and social media, some Indian players have won medals.
The Asian Games are still on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to all those who are still in the race.
India's sportspersons, especially Shooting and Wrestling, are performing well in the games we have not been able to do well before, our sportspersons are bringing medals in the games like Wushu and Rowing.
This is not just a medal, it is a testimony to the courage and dreams of Indian sports and Indian competitors.
Our daughters have a large number of medal winners for the country, this is a positive one.
Many of the youth who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the players who have won medals have emerged from the unforgettable villages and ruins of their lives.
On 29th August, we will observe the National Sports Day, I extend my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts and pay my homage to the great sportsperson of Hockey.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country to sports and pay attention to your fitness because a healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India.
India will build a bright future when it fits.
Once again, congratulations to the winners of the Asian Games.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where architecture and engineering have unforgettable links.
Everyone was surprised to see the queen of the eleventh century at Patan in Gujarat.
An engineering laboratory all over India.
There are many such engineers in India who have imagined the unimaginable and have set an example by showing excellent performance in the engineering world.
Our great engineers have a glorious gem in their legacy that still makes people wonder.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he remembered the rest of the country with great respect and respect.
On 15th September, Engineers was celebrated as Day in his memory.
Following his footsteps, engineers of our country have made their mark in the eastern world.
I am reminded of the terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001 when I was talking about the unprecedented performance of the engineering world.
He was joking at me. Look, this is my house.
Kutch is in Bhunga.
My house has seen three earthquakes.
He was saying this thing with pride, and I feel that even a long time ago, our engineers used to judge the local environment and conditions and build houses so that people could be safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we will have to think about the future and organize workshops at different places.
We have to think about what new things do we have to learn in the changing times
You need to teach
The world is fighting natural calamities.
What's going to be the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
What should students teach
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this idea.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It stimulates the thinking of the people.
You must have seen on TV that a team of 12 teacher football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It takes usually hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But on that day Bhagyadevi had a different wish.
When they entered a lot inside the cave, there was a lot of water in the mouth of the cave due to heavy rains.
Efforts are made to know where those youngsters are, where they are, how they can be brought out.
But I'd like to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government, the parents of the children, the family, the media, the citizens of the country have shown a remarkable attitude of peace and patience.
Everyone has joined this mission in a team.
I think it is a matter of learning and self-confidence.
My parents didn't bother or mother didn't drown their eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the calm use of society is really academic for us.
A soldier from Thailand's navy was killed in this absurdity.
The entire world is surprised that despite such a terrible situation, the rescuers have not given up their hopes and patience in the dark cave.
This shows that when people are united, there are wonderful things.
It is essential that we calmly concentrate on our goals and work for them.
A few days ago, our country's popular poet Neeraj Prayag had passed away.
The speciality of the poet was hope, confidence, determination and confidence.
All the words of poet Neeraj can inspire all of us.
He wrote: The darkness will go as far as the thunderbolt gets lighted, the darkness will go away.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for the youth.
This is because this is the time when a Peak Session for colleges is being organized.
Millions of youngsters leave school and go to college.
In the month of February and March, the examination, question-answer dated April and May, with the celebration of the holidays, the results, the future lifestyles and chairs of the career were spent.
The month of July is the month when youngsters step in the new path of their lives, when focus is shifted from uiz to cut-off.
The focus of the students goes from home to hostel.
The students entered the umbrella of professors from the umbrella of parents.
I believe that my young friends are very enthusiastic and happy about the auspicious occasion of college life.
For the first time, getting out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a safe environment, we have to show ourselves our way.
All these youngsters leave their homes and take their lives forward in a new way.
There's no way out of books, we need to study, but we need to continue looking for innovative things.
Old friends are precious.
The youngsters who have left their homes and have gone out of their homes should discover that place and know about the people, language and culture of that place.
My best wishes to all the youngsters for starting a new chapter.
Her father's lived up to the family by washing the waste of shit.
I congratulate ASHARAM for this success.
There are so many families who have shown their hard work and concentration in adverse conditions that inspire us all.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is the bus driver of DTC or Kolkata Abhay Gupta, who studied under the footpaths of the road, among them are Afreen Shaikh, the daughter of Ahmedabad, whose father is Auto Chala, the daughter of a resident of Nagpur, Khushi, son of Chaukidar in Haryana, Karthik, son of Chaukidar of Haryana or Ramesh Sahu, son of a brick-bearer of Jharkhand.
The victims of genetic diseases called spinal muscular atopsy since birth in Anushka Panda, a handicapped girl from Gurgaon, have achieved great success by crossing all barriers to their determination and determination.
How many such examples we will get when we look around.
Any good thing from any part of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got a news from which I had written: "Modi's dream was successful.
After reading the news, I came to know how our youth is trying to bring about a change in the lives of the common man through the medium of technology smart and creative usage.
Once I had appealed to the Indian youth in the city of Technology Hub, USA to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something out of time.
I had requested to convert brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee have made a remarkable effort by acknowledging my challenge.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji jointly created a Smart Gram App.
These apps will not only connect the people of the village with the entire world but they will also get any information or information on their mobile phones.
The App is allotted to the village telephone directory, News section, Events list, Health Centre, Information Centre.
The FACT rate among the farmers is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT rate among the farmers is being marketed for the sale of their produce.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, Pandharpur is a unique festival.
Friends, The eighteenth of the sixteenth month, which was on 23rd July this year, the Pondicherry pilgrimage of Pondicherry was celebrated with a lot of fervor.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
The monks like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were left in the paduka palanquin and dancing in the name of Lord Vithal.
Bhagwan Bitthal, who is also known as Pithoba or Pandurang, visited the place for his darshan.
Lord Vitthal protected the welfare of the poor, the helpless and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have unwavering respect and devotion.
You go to the Beethoba Temple in Pondicherry, there is a different feeling of importance, beauty and spiritual joy.
My request to the audience of Mann Ki Baat is that if there is an opportunity, you will certainly achieve the experience of the pilgrimage to Pandharpur.
Innumerable monks like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are teaching the common people even today in Maharashtra.
We get the advice of goodwill, love and fraternity from them in words like 'Varood' or 'Abhang'.
We have got this mantra from us that society can fight against blind faith.
They have guided the society at the right time and have ensured that the old evils of the society go away, they have brought compassion, equality and purity among the people.
Just like a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who has made a deep impression on many Indians.
On 23rd July, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Tilak ji, and on the occasion of his death anniversary, we remember him with devotion.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and self-confident.
He had the power and intelligence to mislead British rulers.
The British used to scare Lokmanya Tilak so much that he was accused of treason three or three times in twenty years.
I would like to tell you about the idols of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people had gathered to welcome him 100 years ago.
After becoming the Mayor of the City Corporation, Vallabhbhai Patel decided to establish a memorial of His Majesty Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Normally, the British rulers are extremely dissatisfied with this and the Collector repeatedly proposes to construct a memorial called Smaru Hella.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, he will resign, but he will leave the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, the statue of Sardar Patel was constructed and the statue was inaugurated on 28 February 1929 by inviting Mahatma Gandhi.
During the Maha Udgahan programme, the revered Bapu had said that Ahmedabad had not only received one person as the Mayor but also had a power to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the special features of this statue that Sardar Patel had established is that Lokmanya Tilakji Chair has written under this statue, Swaraj is my birthright.
It sounded like God's instructions to the English.
The first public Ganesh Festival was organized by Lokmanya Tilak.
The universal Ganesh Festival has traditionally enriched the honour and honour of society and has become an effective medium for social awakening, unity, harmony and equality.
Ganesh Mandap is now visible on the streets of any city.
All the families of that street together organize the Ganesh Mahotsav.
This is an unparalleled opportunity for our youth so that they can acquire powers like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said this thing last time as I recall Lokmanya Tilakji, let us celebrate the Ganesh Mahotsav with Dhammadham but let us celebrate the festival of Parvesh-Bhandab.
May the idol of Ganesha ji embellish his decorations, priesthoods and all the environment.
He who dedicated his life so that the countrymen can breathe in a free India.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
There are youngsters in India who do not get inspiration from listening to these poems - Sarphorashi Ki Damanna of Haydekhana Hai Jor Kitna Baju-e-Katil Mei Hai, the lines of this poem inspired the talents like Ashfaq Khal Khan, Bhagwad Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad.
The courage and freedom of Chandra Shekhar Azad had inspired many youngsters.
Azad had lived his life, but he never gave up in front of the foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrashekhar Azad Ji.
Just a few days ago, at the Junior Junior Junior Twenty World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter Hima Das won the gold medal.
The country and one daughter Ekta Bhawan e-mailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter and are now preparing for the Asian Games.
I am proud that whenever athletes live in an athlete, he hugged the shores and I was proud to have done it.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
His achievements are remarkable that he has made his challenge a success.
On the Road Accident in 2003, solidarity under the body of a terrible skeleton fell apart, but this girl did not lose courage and made herself strong and reached her goal.
I convey my congratulations to Ekta Bhawanji, Yogesh Katuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji for their courage and struggle.
Please move forward, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of the month of August are full of festivals, but sometimes diseases also enter the house for the season.
I convey my best wishes for the good health of all of you, for this month of August and for the centenary celebrations.
Mann Ki Baat will be reunited.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I am fortunate to be face to face with you all.
A few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You may have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international test match and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides have exhibited excellent sporting skills in the match.
Rasheed Khan, an audience from Afghanistan, had played well in IPL this year, and I remember the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashrafghani, who tagged me and wrote on his Twitter: People of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sportspersons.
Rasheed represented the best of Afghanistan, the Prime Minister said.
He is a resource in the field of cricket, and he enjoys a little bit of fun - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be remembered to all of us.
Though it was the first match, it's normal to remember, but I'll remember the match for another thing.
The Indian team has done something that is unprecedented all over the world.
When the Indian team was taking the tomatoes, a conquest team showed what it could do.
The Indian team invites the Afghan team, which is playing the international match for the first time, and takes photographs together.
We can feel from this thing as to what can be a sportsman spirit and a sportsmanship.
Sports is the best way to unite the society and to find out the talent that our youth has.
My best wishes to the two teams of India and Afghanistan
My dear countrymen, an unprecedented sight was witnessed on 21st June, 4th June.
Whether it is European Parliament in Brazil, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese naval ship, the people are exercising Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga has been organised and I have been told that the women of Demonstration of several seats have also been organized.
India and China have joined hands on high ice peaks in Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with so much enthusiasm, why should it not be encouraging in India
Our air warriors have pillared everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet above the ground in the middle of the sky.
It was a sight, they weren't sitting in the airplane, they were flying in the air.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A panorama of Ahmedabad was spectacular, where about 750 physically challenged brothers and sisters together created a record by practicing Yoga.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a wellness revolution.
An effort of wellness is being carried out by Yoga, I hope that it will progress.
Gradually, more and more people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone call.
Do you know why Kabirdas Ji had gone to this megahar
He is the one who knows and understands the sorrows of others.
He who doesn't understand the sufferings of others, he's cruel.
Kabir Das ji stressed on social coordination.
"Jagme Bari Koi Nehi, Joe Mann Ki Baat.
Oh, sweetheart. Please. Please.
For another purpose, Kabir Das ji says, "Whoever is a kind religion, which is greed and sin.
Her precious words have been effected even after so many years. Now that we are talking about Saint Kabir Das Ji, he is reminded of one of his faults.
This is the greatness of Guru and one such guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have guided crores of people to the path of truth have been inspiring people for the past.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
And this is another history that has been associated with Punjab.
The terrible event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which is about to complete 100 years, is the event that shameed humanity.
Someone forgot the black day of April 13, 1919, when firing on innocent, innocent and innocent civilians crossing all limits of cruelty by misusing power.
But we will always remember the eternal message that has been delivered by this incident, that no problem can be solved through jealousy and abuse.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi, will be writing on Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2018.
Ramanji, thank you very much at first
It was a pleasure to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, on 23rd June, Dr.
It may be very few people know that in 1937, Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation of the University of Kolkata.
That was the first example when during the British regime, a person spoke in a Bengali language at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata.
From 1947 to 1947, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's first Industrial Minister and, in a sense, India's entrepreneurship and in a holistic way, founded a strong foundation for India's progress.
In 1948, the first entrepreneurship of independent India was based on his plan and vision.
Dr.
It was Mukherjee's dream that India would be self-reliant, better and prosperous in every field of industry.
He wanted India to become a big industry and with it full focus on MSMEs, textiles, textiles and textiles.
For the proper development of cottage and slaughter industry, he started the Finance and Organisation Set Up for the All India Radio between 1947 and 1947.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very emotional about the development of West Bengal.
Because of his thoughts, consciousness and activity, a part of West Bengal has been protected and is still a part of India.
Come, let us remember the message of this unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and make sincere efforts to take India forward through harmony and fraternity.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with all those who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I had got the opportunity to move away from the file and listen directly to the people.
People have expressed their resolve, their happiness and sorrow.
I believe that this was not just a government program, but it was a different learning experience, and what could be more satisfaction than what I have seen in the eyes of the people at this time
When I used to listen to a common man, his simple words, his simplicity, his feelings, he used to touch his heart.
I knew how women from far-flung villages have been helping in creating passports for the common people from the old age of the village to the elderly.
One of the sisters of Chhattisgarh is collecting data and selling ice creams from them. Lakhs of youngsters of the country, like Anjan Prakash, have been running Jan Aushadhi system in Jharkhand and are going to nearby villages and supplying cheaper medicines.
The youngsters in West Bengal who were looking for jobs two-three years ago are not only doing their business successfully but they have also provided employment to 10-15 persons.
Students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important topics like West Management at the school's Tinkering Lab at an early age.
There were stories of such experiences, there was no place in the country where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that in the entire event, I have felt the strength of the success of the government, the strength of the 10th power of the country, the strength of the New India, the strength of the resolve.
There are some people in the society, unless they talk disappointingly, do not talk about disappointment, they do not work to create unbelief, they do not find a way to break instead of building.
In such a scenario, when people talk about new hopes, new zeal and accomplishments of their lives then their success is not deserved by the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to my countrymen.
You have connected 40-40, 50-50 lakh people with this video bridge and have given me new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I have also felt this aroma of goodness.
In fact, the Corporate Professionals of Bangalore, IT engineers have jointly created a simple prosperity trust and have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, they have been connected with the farmers, have constructed the schemes and have been working hard to increase the income of the farmers.
Through these trusts, the professionals, engineers and technologists are being assisted by the farmers in providing them with new methods of cultivation, how to harvest organic farming with one crop and how to harvest other crops.
Earlier, those farmers who were dependent on only one crop so that the crops could not be sufficient or profitable. Today they are not only suppliing several crops but also making good profits by proper marketing of crops through this trust.
Farming will be good only when good seeds are used and Seed Banks have been created separately for this purpose.
Women are taking care of the Seed Bank and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST will be completed.
The dream of 'One Nation One Tax' has been realized today.
If I have to give credit to anyone for this arrangement, I will give this credit to the states.
GST is a shining example of cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to work together for the welfare of the country and as a result such a huge tax reform system has been launched in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can be proud that the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been taken in a unanimous manner, despite the presence of different political figures, representatives of different states and different priorities.
Before GST, there were 17 different taxes in the country, but after the introduction of this system, there are only one tax system in the country.
After GST, check posts have also been discontinued and this has increased the pace of transportation of goods and other goods, which has not only saved time but also benefitted in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
This huge tax reform in India has been successful because the people of the country have adopted this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that such a massive reform takes five to seven years to properly implement such a large country with such a large population.
However, the enthusiasm of the honest countrymen, the flow of honesty and the participation of the people of the country, the result of this is that within a year this new tax system has created its place, it has been established and it is also being revised through an inbuilt system.
This is a great achievement that has achieved 125 crore Indians.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must be reminded that a team of six women commanders of the Navy has been sailing for the past few months.
I would like to say something about Nabika Sagar Parikrama.
The team of six daughters of India has returned to India on May 21 through more than 250 days of IN-SV Tarini and received warm welcome from all over the country.
Approximately 22,000 nautical distances have been covered across the oceans and seas.
This is an unprecedented thing in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate these daughters for their courageous work, for enhancing the reputation of the Navy, for enhancing the honour of India and especially the daughters of India.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information has been received about Mount Everest-Jai people.
On 16th May, five tribal students from Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhurube, Pramesh Ale, Umakanta Madhbee, Poet Das Katmode and Vikas Soyam won the highest peaks in the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh since August 2017.
They were elected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning Everest with the help of their names, they have brightened the name of the country.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to the small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, the sixteen-year-old Shivangi Teacher won Everest in Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
Everest wins the first father-daughter jubilee of the winning bajaz and his daughter Dia Everest.
Not only the youngsters are winning Everest, but in the last 19th May, the 50th Smt. Sangeeta Behl also won Everest.
There are also some Everest climbers who are not only skilled but also experienced.
This work is not only commendable, but is also responsible for cleanliness and environment.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those brave heroes, especially daughters.
So many people from different fields will come forward to support this.
In the context of Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we play, the country will play.
People are sharing videos of their Fitness Challenge in Social Media, they are also challenging others by tagging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and such challenges inspire us to stay fit and keep fit of others.
My dear countrymen, several times in Mann Ki Baat you have heard something about sports and sportspersons from me.
"Chobi Jadavji, thank you very much for your phone
These games were a part of the summer vacation.
There are two conventional games.
There's an outdoor and there's an indoor.
One of the diversity of our country is perhaps one of these games.
The same game is known by various names.
It is played on the Square Board of 8th May with a beard or a basket or a gutti.
Its name is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, it is Pakhidakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
Residents of different states don't know each other's languages, but they're right at playing.
That's a village-city game everywhere.
This is also known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Goti Billa or Karabilla.
In Orissa, it's called a fireplace, in Maharashtra it's called Bittidalu.
Creating traditional sports in such a way that besides physical capabilities, it also helps in enhancing our physical thinking, concentration, awareness and speed.
And these are not just sports but they can teach the values of our lives, set the goal of teaching, achieve determination, create team spirit and help each other.
Just a few days ago, I was seeing that our traditional games have been incorporated in the training programmes of Business Management for the development of individuals and for the upliftment of international skills.
At the same time, we are aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports make us aware about our society, environment etc.
Now the youth should come forward and encourage these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum of our heritage sports.
This game can be made videotelling to show how to play the rules of the game.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know, play and grow up, my dear countrymen
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you all to understand the importance of this idea that we dont use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the harmful effect of plastic pollution on our nature, wild life and our health.
I urge all the information from World Environment Day website weedindia 2018 to try to use it in our daily lives.
Loss of lives, loss of resources.
All these changes in the Weather Pattern are the consequences.
Mahatma Gandhi has been saying this thing for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, COP 21 and Paris Agreement, we have united the world through International Solar Alliance, and behind all these things we are doing a good job to fulfil the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this surrounding day, we thought about what we can do to make this world cleaner and greener.
How can we move forward on this path, what can we innovate
It's raining.
Now we can plant a record number of trees and it is not only planting but it is also important to take care of the trees until they grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
On 21st June, all of you remember that not only you and me but the entire world is remembering June 21st.
All over the world, 21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga and it is unanimously recognized that the preparations for the event began a few months ago.
It is reported that the world is preparing to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga enhances courage that always protects us like a father.
Forgiveness creates a mentality like mother feels for her own child, mental peace becomes our eternal friend.
Vardhuhari had said that by doing yoga regularly, the truth is our son, grace is our fear, self-respect, our brother, the world is our bed and knowledge.
When someone is so talented, this Yoga naturally conquered all kinds of fears.
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to take forward the huge heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and emotional nation.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on the occasion of Triple Talaq.
I salute Panditji.
In May 1857, the people of India had given the English their own strength.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were roaring against injustice.
Sadly, for a long time, we have called the 1857 incident just a rebellion or a military militia.
In fact, it wasn't just a small show, it was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This brave Savarkar was a fearless writer that what had happened in 1857 was not an aggression, but the first fight for freedom.
With Savarkar, the brave hearts of India House in London celebrated its 50th birth anniversary.
He was a worshipper of both arms and scriptures.
Veer Savarkar, who is familiar with his struggle against Bahaduri and the British Raj.
But apart from this, he was also an Ojaswai poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has given a unique description of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution with him.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave leader.
Our daughters, who had once been forced to visit the houses and houses from the waste stupa, today they are learning the work of sewing the toilets to the poor.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and belief.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something and if you are committed to it then success can be achieved even in all the difficulties and this is not just a sign but you will be able to see it at every corner of Hindustan.
Look around you, the neighbors will look at how people are defeating the problem.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea store, whenever we get satisfaction with tea there is a discussion and analysis with some people.
These discussions are political, social, films, sports and sportspersons, the problems faced by the country, the solutions to this problem should be done in such a way but most of the time this practice is limited to discussions.
He organized education, health and food for all children coming to school.
He wiped out the darkness of their life.
TASO MA UNGAME: Who doesn't know this phenomenon, but he has done it.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire nation.
There will be many such incidents that inspire you.
There's probably a lot of things.
Come, let us take our positive mindset forward.
It is so hot in June that people wait for rain and hope for the clouds of the sky.
People will also wait for the moon after some time from today.
The power to see the moon is the essence of Eid.
At the end of one month's fast during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of a bright festival.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate this festival with a lot of enthusiasm, especially for the children.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all very much.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, Commonwealth Games were organized in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated in this.
How encouraging environment can be created when such a big event is being organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participate in it, imagine it
Our sportspersons also showcase the unique sporting talent of our countrymen and win one medal after another.
Whether it is shooting, cottage, loading, table tennis or badminton, India has achieved record success.
India has won 66 medals with 26 gold, 20 rupees, 20 bronze.
This has made every Indian proud.
After the end of the sports, when the medal winners of India joined the athletes with medals and played medals on the Vijay Platform, the National Music was a unique experience of happiness, pride and honour.
But I want to tell you what I'm listening to these players.
India's performance at Commonwealth Games was very good, at the same time it was vibrant.
Manika Batra won medals in all the events that Manika Batra had contested.
Manika Batra, the first Indian woman to bring India a gold medal in her personal Table Tennis.
15-year-old Indian shooter Anish Bhanwala has been the youngest player in India to win gold medals.
India's only Chinese Commonwealth Games won a medal in Para Power Lifting.
This time the games have won a lot of medals.
Whether it is squash or boxing, loading or shooting, women sportspersons have shown their valour.
In the Badminton final, two Indian players, Saina Nehbal and P.
V.
The whole country saw this game.
The participants in the games have come from small towns in different parts of the country.
We have reached this place by crossing many constraints.
The achievements that they have achieved today, their parents, parents, guardians, coaches, other assistants, schools, school teachers or schools have played a significant role in this lifestyle.
Their friends have also played a key role in enhancing the spirit of the players in every situation.
Together with the players, I thank them all.
Janak gentleman, Shri Shashikant Bhosle shared a picture of his swimming pool and wrote, My body is my weapon, my basic substance water, my world is swimming.
Another, I feel happy and healthy to myself by visiting the dawn written by Ruma Devnath.
He added that Fitness comes with a smile, and when we are happy, we will laugh.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness is fitness.
Dhubal Tomato wrote a picture of his trekking.
Traveling and trekking for me is Fit India.
It is heartening to see that some of the names are also very attractively encouraging our youth for Fit India.
Chitravinetta gave a video on Akshaykumar Twitter.
I've seen that video, you'll see, and this video shows him exercising with a piece of wood.
He said that this exercise is very useful for the stomach and back muscles.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You must be preparing.
On 21st June, the importance of International Day of Yoga has now been acknowledged by the whole world.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or the world about the use of yoga in physical development, mental development and normalizing the mental condition.
You might have seen an animated video that showed me.
Animation is being done through animation and I thank the animation producers for taking very good care of this thing.
My young friends, all of you have come out of the examination camps and are thinking about the holidays.
I would like to invite you for a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time learning something new.
Outside the four walls, paper-columns and computers, new life experiences can be gained.
My young friends, for a special internship, I would like to appeal to you today that three or four Ministries of the Government of India, such as Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Department, all of them are Swachh Bharat Summer II.
Those who have done excellent work in colleges and universities will be rewarded at the national level and those who have successfully served in ICAI will be rewarded.
I once again invite my students and young friends to join the International Ship.
I hope that our young society will move ahead with the Swachhata Movement.
I would like to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experiences, send story, send photos, send videos.
Look at the India programme regularly and you will be able to know how many people from different parts of the country are doing well and how good they are discussing.
Just a few days ago, I was seeing that these youngsters who are selflessly educating some of the poor children of Delhi have started a massive work towards educating the children of Delhi.
Initially, they explained to the beggars of the streets and the children who worked for small things, they also joined the development work.
Beginning with 15 children of a settlement near Geetha Colony in Delhi today, it has become an act of educating two thousand children at 12 locations in the capital.
In this campaign, young teachers have been trying their best to change the society by taking out two hours of free time from their daily busyness.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand have set an example of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fate of not only themselves but also of their respective regions.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, the cultivation of potatoes, potatoes and yabs is done.
In hilly areas, farmers did not get the right price for their crops, but the farmers of Kopkot tehsils avoided the loss of their produce directly in the market and took the path of value addition.
They have made biscuits from farm crops and are selling the biscuits.
These farmers have set up a government agency at Munnar and have opened a biscuit bakery.
The government has incorporated it into the National Livelihood Mission (NLM).
This biscuit has spread to about 50 Anganwadi centres in Bageshwar district, even to Kosani Almora.
With this effort of the farmers, the Turn Overseas of the company has not only reached 10 to 15 lakhs but at the same time more than 900 families have been provided with food grains.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard that the war for water will begin in the coming days.
Everyone says, but don't we have any responsibility
Water conservation is not new to Indians.
It is not a matter of reading books that there is no need to know any particular language.
In the past, our ancestors showed it.
They gave maximum importance to the importance of every drop of water.
They have taken new ways to save every drop of water.
If you visit Tamil Nadu, you will see that many temples there have been scriptures about water conservation, water conservation, water conservation, lamp making etc.
Large rock edicts are seen in the temples of Mannarkobil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai.
Even today, many bufferies are known as step wells tourism, but they are shining examples of the efforts of our ancestors to conserve water.
If you go to Rajasthan, you will definitely visit Chand Bauri in Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and most beautiful baury, one thing we need to remember is the largest baury in the region where there is a severe water scarcity.
Water conservation will be as effective as the timelines for conservation of water on April, May, June-July, and the timelines for conservation of water.
Water conservation can be spent on Manrega budget.
Several efforts have been made to conserve water and conserve water during the last three years.
About 32,000 crore rupees have been spent for water conservation and water dams in the Manrega Budget every year.
On 2017-18, I can say that out of 64 thousand crore rupees, 55 or around Rs. 35,000 crore has been spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, this water conservation and water conservation system has benefitted about 150 lakh hectares of agriculture.
This work has been done with the hard work of nearly 40-45 villages.
I will say, April, May, June, July and coming, we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days, take some plans and do something.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a Mann Ki Baat, there are several news reports, letters and phone calls from all around the country.
But the public does not know anything about the philosophy that can be saved from the philosophy of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's pacefully, beautyfully and integrity.
Please, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, you will talk about it so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, Rabindranath was a talented personality, a personality of diverse thoughts, but he had a teacher in him.
He wrote in Geethanjali: "He who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students".
The coincidence of roasting is that when people are irregular, they can feel hungry for others.
When he is thirsty, he can feel the thirst of others.
This is a time to recall the teachings and messages of the Father of the Nation.
The teachings of his life create a commitment to equality and brotherhood among us.
Once a priest asked him, "What is the best thing in Islam"
"In order to feed the poor and the underprivileged, and to maintain harmony with everyone in an unconscious manner.
He believed in wisdom and compassion.
He was not arrogant about anything.
He used to say that ego makes wisdom reflected.
Poegambar Mohammad said that if anyone has more than required, you should give it to someone who needs it, so donating Ramzan has a special importance.
In this sacred month, all of them gave gifts to the weak.
Paigambar Mohammad believed that the sacred soul of the individual was to enrich him.
My dear countrymen, Buddhism is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is a country of compassion, service and sacrifice which has guided millions of people across the world.
This intellectual vision reminds us of the great responsibility of his efforts, determination and walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
It's the human values that are the most needed in the world today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar was extremely inspired by Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Whether the people of the country are oppressed, persecuted or deprived, Baba Saheb has strengthened the people of this region through the Constitution.
There can be no greater example than compassion.
Lord Buddha's compassion for human suffering was one of his great qualities.
We have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha from all over Asia.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the teachings of Buddha are linked to the roots of Buddhism. And that is why we are building the infrastructure of Buddhism that connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the Buddhist regions of India.
For the entire world, I bless the great soul that we can fulfil our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world in his ideals.
Today we are reminding Lord Buddha that you must have heard about the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to have brought good fortune to Lafing Buddha, but very few people know that this Sahasya Buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of India's security.
You might be wondering what could be the connection between the forces of 'Lafing Buddha' and the army of India
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of May 11, 1987, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had spoken to the countrymen who had conveyed the message of pride, valour and happiness to the entire nation.
There was a new self-confidence among the people of India spread all over the world.
That day was intelligent.
On 11th May, 1998, an atomic test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan in the western part of India.
Twenty years have passed since this test was conducted on the Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's experiments were successful. On the one hand, India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that the day is marked as the day of his military might in India's history.
Lord Buddha showed the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
In this way, when you become a nation, you will be able to live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May, 1998 is not only important for the testing of atoms in that month, but it is more important than what was done.
It showcased the entire world that India is capable of achieving new goals and heights by keeping the great scientists on their own land and a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra: Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan - Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of May 11, 1998, the mantra of Atal ji 'Jai Vigyan' that we have given to India, we have to move forward to build a modern India, we have to make a solemn pledge for making a strong India and a supporting India.
We have to make our energy a part of India's energy.
And then we will also be able to enjoy the journey that Atal ji had started to see.
My dear countrymen, I will talk about Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Representatives from ASEAN countries came here on 26th January and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had presented Ramayana to us.
It means that not only in India but also in ASEAN countries, the impact and inspiration of Ram and Ramayana is the same even today.
My dear countrymen, I have received plenty of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you every time.
I read what I wrote in MyGov about starting online courses of soft culture.
Besides being an IT worker, I am very happy to see your passion for Sanskrit.
I have asked the stakeholders to inform you about this.
I also urge all the audiences of Mann Ki Baat who are working on Sanskrit, to think about how this proposal of soft tactics can be taken forward.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar of Barakar village of Nalanda district of Bihar reads on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed about the decreasing groundwater level is really important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every animal that lives in this land.
In the summer, you requested for water supply for animals and birds.
Shackle-yes, you think I've reached all the audience friends.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Yogesh Bhadresha said, I would like to say something about the health of the youth.
According to him, the youngsters of our country are physically weaker than other Asian countries.
Just a few days ago, the Honble President of France had visited Kashi and written to Shri Prashant Kumar from Varanasi, he had touched his heart and inspired him.
He expressed his interest that all these pictures should be broadcast on video social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India shared all the photos on social media and Narendra Modi App.
I would like to tell all the kids like Angha, Jayesh that if all these letters were read, my entire day's dread, hard work would be a bit of a temperament.
All these letters, so many phone calls, opinions and opinions that I have been able to hear, and there are many things that have touched my heart.
They wrote about their exams, shared their holiday plans, and thought about the sufferings of animals and birds in this summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have also sent me letters about Kisan Mela and farming activities in the country.
Some conscious citizens sent me suggestions on water conservation.
In the season of the festival, a lot of letters are coming about our festivals, our culture and traditions.
On reading your letters, I can say that Ali, a resident of Karimganj in Assam, has made nine schools for the poor children by filling their hearts with his will.
When I can hear the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Mohan Mohan Singh of Kanpur, who walked from the foothills and treated his brothers and sisters from the foothills and gave free medicines then it is a matter of pride and pride for the compassion and humanity of the country.
The sister of Calcutta taxi driver Sadul Laskar died due to lack of timely treatment.
Many such inspiring events have been accomplished by my country.
Today, the whole world sees India in other eyes.
Today, when the name of India is enshrined with immense respect, then the glory of the children and children of this country is hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, it will be very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
Because there's a lot of farming letters.
This time, I have seen the video of the interaction with farmer friends on the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and I believe that all the farmers should see this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and use agricultural suggestions in their own fields.
Whether we talk about Mahatma Gandhi or whether Shastri ji or Rabindra Charan Singh or Rabindra Devilal ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and public life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized on conservation of trees, plants, forests, etc. and the need for better agro-processing.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of a comprehensive public awareness for better income, better irrigation system for our farmers and to ensure all these things and to increase food and milk production.
In 1992, Charan Singh in his address emphasized the need for farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
Our Meghalaya farmers have produced record production over the last five years in 2015-16.
They showed that if the goal is fixed, there is complete confidence, there is a promise in the mind then everything can be done.
Today, technology has been linked with the hard work of the farmers.
Agricultural producers are immensely empowered.
I have seen that many farmer friends have written about the MSP and they want me to discuss it in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide the farmers the right price.
It has been decided that MSP for specific crops will be reduced to one and a half times the investment.
Besides, detailed work is being done on the Agriculture Marketing Reform to ensure that the farmers are given the right price.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the villages are connected to the world market.
For farmers not to go far enough to sell their produce, it will be linked to APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the necessary infrastructure of 20,000 rural haats.
That is, a system is being created to connect with any market in the country from a single farm.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I request you all to share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What can be the logo of Gandhi 150
All health related activities were previously in charge of the Ministry of Health.
Preventive Health Care is very cheap and easy.
We will be aware of the Preventive Health Care, individuals, families and societies.
Cleanliness is the first condition of keeping life healthy.
Besides, work is also going on in the direction of creating Health Wellness Centre across the country.
Yoga as a preventive health care has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached home.
This year, International Day of Yoga is 21st June and 100 days left.
In the last three International Day of Yoga, people from all over the country and abroad participated very enthusiastically.
We have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage our family and friends to join us.
In a new and innovative way, we have to popularise Yoga among children, young and adult people, be it male or female.
Television and Electronic Media of the country have different programmes on Yoga.
But can you create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from now on till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga, but I am Yogavasi.
Some people made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thinking and made me a 3-D animated video of Yoga.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Adequate efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare becomes free, inclusive and affordable for the people.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened in the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at affordable prices.
Further new centres are being opened.
Heart Stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knee has also been reduced from 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore households, i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
Every person needs your help to reach this awareness.
We all have to strive together to get rid of TB.
Many years ago, Dr. Ambedkar had spoken of India's industrialization.
Industrial is a strong medium in his vision, which will benefit the poorest of the poor.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt: India would once be a strong centre of labour and industry.
Today, when the Make in India project is progressing successfully across the country, its dreams are inspired by us.
India's position in the global economy is now like a bright star, and the highest FDI inflow is being made in India.
The world trade is now looking at India because we are becoming the hub of investment and new traditions.
Dr. Ambedkar believed in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar wanted that one person of the country should not live in poverty.
He also strongly believed that poverty cannot be thwarted by donating to the poor.
Today, schemes like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are making our country young entrepreneurs and young entrepreneurs.
The vision of the Parliament of the Rivers and the Valleys was imagined by the Working Committee for Water Conservation and Utilization.
Today, the historical activities of the development of waterways and ports have started in the country.
New ports and old ports are being renovated along the coasts of India.
In the decade of 1970, when the world was the second World War, the cool war between the two powerful forces and the country's worries, Dr. Ambedkar had imagined the spirit of Tim India or India.
He understood the importance of Federalism and felt that the Centre and the States should work together for the betterment of the country.
Today, we have envisioned cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism at every level of the country and governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for a large number of people like me.
India's history is completely different: this is an India of Ambedkar who is poor, who is backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized across the country from 14th April to 5th May, surrounding the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
The nationwide campaign will include various programmes for rural development, poverty and social justice.
My condolences to all of you are that all of you should take part in this national campaign.
My dear countrymen, in a few days there are several festivals, festivals and festivals: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaisakhi.
May Mahavir Jayanti remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira, the propagator of non-violence, is an inspiration for us.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
Ester Ellei thinks of Christ Jesus Christ, the peace of humanity, the goodness, justice, compassion and compassion.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all of you for the upcoming festival.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue, but we know from our daily experience that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought whether rivers, oceans, why water becomes colorful
This was the question of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that gave birth to a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding performance in light scattering.
His discovery is known as the Roman Effect.
We celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, as it is said that on this day, he discovered Light Scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The famous particle named Satyendra Nath Bose has also been named after Boson.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a function in Mumbai. I inaugurated the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
The wonderful work that is being done in science is very attractive.
The Artificial Intelligence will help in manufacturing robots, bots and unspecified machines.
Nowadays, various machines are making their intelligence smarter through self learning.
Etechnology can help in improving the lives of the poor, the deprived and the helpless.
On this occasion of Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to know what kind of artificial intelligence can be used to ease the lives of brothers and sisters with disabilities.
Can we get a better idea of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can artificial intelligence simplify healthcare
A few days ago, I had the pleasure of inaugurating the I Create programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There was a young man who said that he had created a digital instrument where if anyone cannot speak, then the instrument meddled with the instrument becomes frightening and you can talk like you can talk to a person who is capable of speaking one thing.
I think we can use artificial intelligence to do such things.
Science and Technology Valueutral.
You are not involved in this.
Any machine will do what we want.
But it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Tomas Alva Edison, the light ball's inventor, fails many times to do his job.
Once he was asked about this, he said, I have searched for 10,000 ways not to make lights. That is, Edison has also made his failure stronger.
It is a matter of privilege that today I have lived in the workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo, in Auroville.
As a revolution, he challenged the British administration, fought against them, raised their rule.
In this way, he spoke of every aspect of his life like a great sage, sought answers and guided humanity.
Important interest in asking questions to know the truth.
On National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I have received a lot of messages about safety and disaster during the time of crisis, people should write to me something or the other.
From Pune, ShrimanRabindra Singh has sent his comments on occupational safety in the NarendraMobile App.
He wrote that in our country, safety standards are not good in terms of calligraphy and construction.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily lives, if we cannot protect ourselves, then it is even more difficult to ensure safety and security in the face of any major threat or disaster.
Most of the accidents are the result of our mistakes, except for natural disasters.
If we remain cautious, follow the required rules, then we can save our lives and also protect our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that there are several guidelines on safety in the field of work, but these rules are not followed at all.
My request is that all the municipalities and municipalities who have fire brigades should go to different schools at least once a week to drive mock drills in front of students.
It will be of two benefits - a cautious habit and a new generation of children will also learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the nation to deal with the menace of disasters.
A scheme called Apada Mitra has been started to provide training to voluntary workers in Cyclone or Vanna-Pravan districts.
Training and awareness are extremely important.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lu or hit wave.
NDMA then organised workshops on Heat Wave and launched a campaign to increase public awareness.
We have a good outcome in the collective endeavour.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave decreased unexpectedly to about 220.
This makes sense that if we take care of security, we can be safe.
I would like to honour all those who are present at the scene in the event of an accident and help the victims in rescue operations.
The number of heroes known by such names is not very low.
Friends, Friends, Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Force and the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces, who risked their lives and rescued others.
India and other BI MSTEC countries, namely Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, participated in this exercise led by India a few days ago.
We all heard them many times.
But today if somebody takes our plane and asks us, where is it, where is the life jacket, how to use it, I'm sure nobody can answer it.
If we all become aware of our security then the security of the society is also included in it.
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of wasteto wealth and wasteto energy through biogas in villages to create a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have been initiated and it has been named GOBAR Dhan, Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to make the villages clean and generate income and energy from cattle dung and post-harvest waste to compost and bio-gas.
Animal dung and other biological fossils are used to produce energy in any European country and China.
But it was not fully utilized in India.
Including Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are moving towards this direction.
The goal of bio-gas based power generation is to utilize cow dung, post-agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar-Dhan Yojana, the farmers and rural brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged so that they see cow dung and waste not only as waste but as source of income.
Use of biogas for cooking and power generation will also increase self-sufficiency.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New employment opportunities will be created in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created to effectively implement the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I would like to urge the enthusiastic people, especially the sisters living in the villages, to come forward and make SelfHelp Groups and organise the Assistant Committees to make full use of this opportunity.
I invite you all to join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs, to convert the waste of our village into wealth and to build cow dung from cow dung.
But we came to know of an unprecedented attempt at Raipur in Chhattisgarh and that is the first ' Vajra Mahotsav ' organised in this state .
The objective of this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to increase awareness about cleanliness, create awareness about the ways to create awareness about the re-use of urban waste.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for exhibiting this festival in a unique manner with the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
International Women's Day was celebrated on 8th March every year.
Various events take place in the country and the world .
On that day, through the conferment of Nari Shakti Puraskar, all those women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the last few days.
Today, the country is moving ahead with women led development.
Today, I am reminded of a word of Swami Vivekananda.
Independence. A hundred and fifty years ago, this idea of Swami ji reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
Today, our women power has given them self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They have taken the country and society forward, they have taken the country and society to a new height.
Finally, the dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and are equally involved in the overall development of the country.
A few days ago, a man gave me a great suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, various programmes were organized to observe Women's Day, but what can be organized to honour all the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and city
This is not a small number - 15 lakh women organisations have undertaken cleanliness drives for a month.
Starting from January 26, 2018, in just 20 days, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal Sahiyas, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women princesses.
You can imagine how big it is.
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power, such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will transform the Swachhata Abhiyan in everyday life into a peoples habit with emphasis on cleanliness reforms.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was looking at the news that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after seventy years of independence and it has shown so much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You know, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
It's an important tourist destination.
I am amazed to know that despite being such a big tourist destination in Mumbai, even after so many years of independence, electricity has not reached Elephanta.
For seventy years, three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajdhar, Morbandar and Santbandar - all the darkness that had been there in the lives of the people of that place have been removed and their lives have become bright.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the cave of Elephanta and Elephanta will now grow in the light of electricity.
It is not just a power but a new start in the direction of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, Just a few days back, we have celebrated the 'Shibratri' festival.
The importance of Hollywood is as important as Hollywood slaughter, due to which the evil was burnt to death.
On the day of Holi, sitting together in all our charms, sharing each other's happiness and happiness is a beautiful moment and a messenger of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thanks a lot
And two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day in Sotsah.
For the first time in history, the top leadership of ten nations was present at the celebrations.
My dear countrymen, today Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App.
He wrote, "Death Day of 1st February Space Expedition Kalpana Chawla.
He took us away from the Colombia Space Accident but inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the farewell episode of Kalpana Chawla.
If there is a will and a solid promise, if there is a will to do something, nothing is impossible.
Several scientists from across the country have contributed significantly to the creation of various segments.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Friends, I don't know how many names
Today we talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago in our scriptures, in Skandhpuran, we are talking about 'Dashputra, Samakanaya, Daspukta'.
This is the significance of women in our society.
And that is why in our society women have been given the status of energy.
This woman power binds the entire country, all the societies and families together.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples after this.
He wrote that our brave Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman's "Sukhai-30" warship will inspire him.
Three brave women Bhavna Kanth, Mohan Singh and Avni Chaturvedi are the pilots of the warplane and are currently undergoing training in the Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
Today, there are several sectors where women are the first to live, our women power is doing something or the other.
This has also been added to the Narendra Modi website as an e-book.
Today, women have an important role to play in the ongoing positive changes in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women's empowerment maybe you are wondering what could be the connection between them
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first railway station in India where all levels of employees are women.
Women employees in all categories
Be it commercial department, railway police, ticket examiner, announcement maker, Point Person, more than forty women personnel are handling the station.
Today, our Nari Shakti is leading from the front.
When it comes to tribal women, there is a sure picture in the minds of all, there will be jungles, there will be mountain chests, there will be a familiar view of the children moving ahead with their heads.
But our tribal women in Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of our country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is one of the Maoist-affected areas.
Violence, torture, bombs, guns and guns have created a terrible environment there.
Tribal women living in such terrible conditions are making their own self-reliance through e-rickshaws.
In a very short span of time, all the women there have participated in this process.
As they empower themselves through self-employment, the Maoist-affected areas are also changing their pictures.
Besides, it is also possible to provide special energy to conserve the environment.
I also appreciate the district administration there, from grant-in-aid to training, the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have repeatedly heard that people say that there is something that does not disappear from our existence.
Anything that is negative is a waste, whatever is needed, to be acknowledged.
And the characteristics of our society are sustained process of self-reform.
The identity of any living society lies in its self-reform process.
Several centuries of endeavours against social evils and evils are continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts have been made to create awareness against social curse like child marriage and sages.
He was sworn in in the State to fight against illicit laws such as penance and marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and inspired youngsters, mothers and sisters have all embraced this struggle.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain continues to cross the borders of the state.
In order to make all the people of the society a part of the real development process, it is important to be free from such ill-ethics.
Come, let us all pledge together to remove such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state, the human chain, for describing such special and comprehensive issues for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka wrote in MyGov and spent six thousand rupees per year for the treatment of his father.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana earlier.
However, whenever he came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendra, the price of medicines was reduced by up to seventy percent.
He expressed his willingness that I would like to talk about the mindset of Mann Ki Baat so that more and more people get information about it.
Over the past few years, many people have written to me about this.
I have also seen several videos on social media and have been taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I get to know such a thing, I feel very happy.
I have a deep satisfaction.
And I was also pleased that Shri Darshan ji had thought that the benefits he had received would have been received by others.
This will benefit the common man, especially the elderly, who are forced to take medicines every day.
The life giving medicines bought from here are prepared according to the standards approved by the World Health Organisation .
This is the root cause of affordable medicines.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
These not only provide cheaper medicines but also create new employment opportunities for private entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrit Stores at the hospital.
The only purpose behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, from Maharashtra, Shri Mangesh shared a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
That photo was such that my attention was drawn towards that picture.
A grandson has joined his grandfather in the Clean Morn River Safai Abhiyan.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morna river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to flow for twelve months earlier, but now it is dependent on the weather.
Sadly, the river was filled with wild grass and dust.
A lot of waste was being wasted in the rivers and nearby .
Hence, an Action Plan was formulated and a day before Makar Sankranti, from 13th January to 1st Phase of Mission Clean Morna, four kilometres area was cleaned on either side of the bank of the river Morna.
The Swachhata Abhiyan was conducted in a similar manner on 20th January and I have been told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna is completely cleaned.
This means that nothing is impossible if people take a solemn pledge to do something.
A massive change can be brought about through the mass movement.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Akola, to the administration of the district and the ancient times, to all the citizens associated with this work as a peoples movement.
My dear countrymen, you have heard a lot of discussions about Padma Awards recently.
Newspapers and television discussions have attracted attention.
But if you look at it with a little bit of attention then it will be a matter of pride for you people, because we have a great man and it will be naturally a matter of pride that even today, a few people of our country are reaching this height without any recommendation.
Every year there is a tradition of providing Padma awards but in the last three years there has been a change in its entire process.
Now any citizen can choose any person.
It has brought transparency in the entire process online.
In fact, the electoral process of this award has been completely transformed.
All such persons have been awarded Padma Awards which cannot be seen in big cities, news papers, TV shows.
Now the importance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person in the field of awards.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta ji.
He is making toys from the things that have been left over for four decades, so as to increase the curiosity of science among youngsters.
His efforts are to encourage small people from unnecessary things to scientific experiments.
For this, three thousand schools from different parts of the country are inspiring youngsters by showing films made in 18 languages.
One such story belongs to Sitaba Jodatti, Karnataka.
She is not called the Goddess of Women Empowerment.
Since the last three decades, in Belagavi, he has done a great job in transforming the lives of countless women.
He dedicated himself to the goddess at the age of seven, but then added his entire life to the welfare of the gods.
Not only this, he has done extraordinary work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You might have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family, in a tribal family.
He used to do a little job for life savings but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is honoured not only in India but all over the world for this hobby.
His paintings have been exhibited in many countries like Australia, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who illuminated India's name abroad, has been recognized and given the Padma Shri award.
You will be surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Laxmikutty teaches in the fort area and is still in the middle of the dense forests in the middle of the jungle in the midst of the shadowy huts.
He made five hundred medicinal medicines depending on his memory.
He has skills in manufacturing snake bites.
Laxmiji has been serving people with his knowledge about these herbal medicines.
This unconscious person has been identified and honored with Padma Shri for his participation in the society.
Today, I would like to mention another name. The 75-year-old Subashini Mistrik of West Bengal has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who has dressed in other people's houses to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of medical care and this inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated freely in the hospitals constructed due to their hard work.
I firmly believe that there are many such gems, women and gems in our multi-storeys, whom no one knows or knows.
Sometimes we should come to school and colleges to know about their experiences.
There should be some effort in the society outside the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on January 9, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the day when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate the unbreakable bonds between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized an event where all MPs and mayors from all over the world were invited.
You will be happy to note that Indian Descendants and Mayors from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and many other countries have joined this event.
Our Indian diaspora, who live in different countries of Europe, are working on cyber security, some are associated with Ayurveda, some are enjoying the minds of the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for the recognition of the people of Indian origin and for the people of the world through them.
On 3rd January, the revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
These were not mere theories.
Even today, we can see every step that Bapu's message was justified.
If we make a solemn pledge that we will walk on the path shown by Bapu then what can be a bigger tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes to you all for two thousand eighteen years.
Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Kibat festival this year and see what a strange affirmation it is also the last day of 2017.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things for almost a year.
The exchange of letters, comments and opinions on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat always gives me a new inspiration.
Within a few hours, the years will change, but this continuation of our conversation will continue.
In the next new year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, all over the world, the festival of hydrocrismas.
This festival will be celebrated with great fervor all over India.
At this time of Christmas, we recognise the teachings and teachings of Christianity, and the greatest emphasis on Christianity is Seva Bhava.
This service is also reflected in the essence of thought.
Ramakrishna Paramhansadeva also said that Shiva should serve life in wisdom and all these things have human values all over the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
He has constantly inspired human beings in all these volumes, poets, philosophers, great warriors.
They have guided us to freedom from the bonds of race and religion against injustice and atrocities.
And in this endeavour, he had to lose a lot in his personal life, but he never misunderstood.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Come, let us commit ourselves to inspire Guru Gobind Singh Jis teachings and his great philosophy of life and his ideals in our lives.
You must be surprised to know that the New Year comes every time, and every penny comes every time, what is there to be a special day
The entire India is looking forward to welcoming you to the 21st century.
You must be proud of yourself as voters of the 21st century.
The power of exchange is the greatest strength of democracy.
Remember, you can also play an important role in building India in the 21st century and it is going to start from fifteenth century.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had specially spoken to the youth of 18 to 25 years of resilience.
I believe that the dream of New India will be fulfilled by filling up the capabilities and strength of this life-force with vigour.
The New India that we are talking about in the coming days is a poison free India of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Cleanliness and poverty free India.
New India, whose guidance will be energy, unity and goodwill.
Make a path for yourselves, connect those whom you people are associated with, and in this way be the people of the country prosperous.
Imagine how we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, this is the need of the hour that we can transform the dream of a beautiful and fruitful India of the 21st century into a mass movement.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to quote the news of all these initiatives on how to find a place in New India Youth and create a system in this regard so that it can be easily understood about these things in the world by the age of fourteen.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about Impactivity in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Nothing is impossible for a person who is positive and encouraging.
In English, they also said - Pessimism Leedstoo Wicknes, Optimism to Power.
I had earlier appealed to the people of India to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atomsphere.
I am very happy that people have shared their experiences and experiences on social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Lakhs of people have been identified with Positive India hashtag, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
The composition of semi-economics has started in India and has spread all over the world.
The toilet that Arrespons came was actually inspiring.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some of the countrymen have discussed all the facts that have had a positive impact on the minds of the people of this year.
Some people shared their own experiences.
Sound byte  Minu Bhatia.
I live in Bihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
 Anonymous light increases Rajendra
And he died at the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
This government helped us a lot and we were able to handle the situation a bit.
 My name is Santosh Yadav.
The National Highway has been constructed in 2017 from different villages across our villages.
Two incidents that our Indian soldiers carried out - one of the surgical strikes carried out by Pakistanis, which destroyed the launching pads of the extremists and at the same time it was incomparable for our Indian soldiers in Doklam.
 Namam Satish Bevani.
Over the last forty years, we have been dependent on the pipelines built for the army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So this is not our biggest achievement in 2017.
In a way, there are many people who are working at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are collectively building.
Come, let us enter the year 2018 with all these small joys, let us begin a New Year and take concrete steps for Positive India.
When we're all talking about positive, I'd like to share a word.
I came to know about the inspirational story of Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk of the administrative service of the most respected Kashmir.
He came out of the bitterness of radicalism and hatred and topped the examination of the Administrative Service of Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 the rebels burnt his ancestral home.
There was so much violence and jealousy that his family had to leave their ancestors.
The atmosphere of such violence around a young child was enough for darkness and bitterness in the heart, but the fig did not allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he is inspiring not only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can be destroyed through positive work.
Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
This is the strength of the country, this is the future of our youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion of the world's famous religious places in our country, it is natural to discuss the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
In this world famous temple, crores of devotees are present every year on the blessings of Lord Ayyappaswamy.
How big can there be challenges to maintain cleanliness in the places where devotees come to such a large extent
And especially in the hills and forests.
P.
Vijayan, a police officer, started a program called Punyanam Punkavanam and started the Swachhata Abhiyan to raise awareness about cleanliness.
This campaign is a pilgrim who will not complete his pilgrimage unless he is doing some or the other physical work for cleanliness.
There is no distinction between this campaign.
Every pilgrim is taking part in the cleanliness drive as a part of the worship of God.
Every morning there is a strange sight of this safai and all the pilgrims participated in it.
He can be a celebrity or a wealthy person, or a very big officer, or a common pilgrim, everyone participates in the Punyama Punkavanam programme and has to move ahead with cleanliness.
The countrymen have many such examples.
This cleanliness drive in Sabarimala has been accomplished and the devotees participated in it.
And we have taken a pledge that when Bapu will be the 150th birth anniversary, we will do something to give a Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made at a massive level across the country for cleanliness.
There is a transformation in the rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to monitor the progress of Swachhata at the urban level.
The programme will cover over 4000 crore people of the city.
The Swachhata App will provide analysis for use and revision of the services sector.
It will be seen that every citizen of the city is involved in the process of keeping the city clean and transformed into a habit of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things seem to be very small, but in a society it becomes far-reaching.
Today, I have mentioned such an incident in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Is this wrong with tens of Muslim women since decades
He was not entitled to Muslim women of our country.
I am very happy that our government has focused on this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken urgent steps in this regard and has brought about a 70-year-old change in this tradition.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajkar without pilgrimage and I am glad that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Mehram Vrihaj and Muslim women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North India have expressed their desire to go to Haj.
I suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that the women who want to go to Haj alone should be allowed to do so.
Our efforts will be to ensure that our women get equal rights and equal opportunities so that they can take equal part in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26th is a historic day of our country.
However, the day of 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
The year 2017 was remarkable for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years and Indias MoU with ASEAN has completed 25 years in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for us that on 26th January the ten great leaders of the world have come together.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and our country is a country of fervor.
Perhaps it's not a day when there's no pride.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, and the new year is coming.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
Let us move ahead with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolves.
In January, the sunrise took place and Makar Sankranti Circle was celebrated.
It's a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our legends is in some way connected with the natural catastrophe, but in our culture full of diversity, these incidents of nature are different.
All these elevations are about 13th to 17th January.
The name of these sanctum sanctorums is different but there is only one element in its depth - nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens.
Once again my best wishes to all of you for the New Year 2018
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There is hardly anybody in India who never remembers or respects him.
He testifies to all of us and to all the events in the country.
He completed ninety years on 28th September.
I had the privilege of speaking to Didi on the phone before my foreign trip.
This conversation was exactly the same as a younger brother spoke with his elder sister in a very gentle manner.
Latadi, Pranama.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Greetings.
Modi ji: I had called for this because this time on your birthday I will be busy traveling by air.
Modi ji: I will return 28th tonight, and on the morning of 29th, your birthday will be over.
Okay, okay.
Lotaji: There are many who grow up in their age but it is very important to get the blessings of those who grow up with their own work.
Yes, but I think this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all my friends.
Modi ji:..
I'm more happy when you proudly say your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore because I can see and know how busy you are and how much you work.
How much you have to think.
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I sent someone to take her blessings.
My mother too was very happy to shower your love.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't get up in time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, from today onwards, the flames of festivals will be filled with new inspiration and resolve.
It's the season of the festival
Over the next few weeks, the festival will be happy and shining across the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this festival.
And it is called the darkness at the bottom of the lamp.
Maybe this proverb isn't just a word, it's an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Imagine, some houses are lighted on one side
On the other hand, in front of him, some people wander dark in their homes.
In some houses, sweets are destroyed, and in some homes children are fond of sweets.
At least, additional or unauthorized household items can be delivered out.
This work is being done by startups of some of the young friends of ENGO in many cities.
They collect dresses, sweets, food from people's homes, then find the neglected people and bring the things closer to them.
Can we sleep in the darkness of the lamp with full consciousness and determination during this festival
Laxmi was welcomed in the traditional tradition.
In our culture, girls are described as Lakshmi because they bring fortune and prosperity.
This year, can we have universal programmes to honour girls in our society, villages and cities
Can we keep a programme to honour these lakhs of people of India in this Deepavali
There are many daughters around us, many brides who are doing extraordinary work.
Some people are working to educate poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as a doctor, some are trying to bring justice to someone as a lawyer.
May our society take pride in their recognition and respect.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
You can do one more thing, share the achievements of these girls in the social media as much as possible and use the hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
For example, we had organized a massive campaign called Selfie with Daughter, which had spread across the world.
My dear countrymen, I have said in the Mann Ki Baat programme that I have the privilege of speaking directly or indirectly to a large number of familiar people.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayong, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very happy to read it, I think it would be very useful for me to read it before the book examination.
I liked a lot of things in this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions in this book for students, but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
So, my young friends also have the confidence that if the country's main servant is told about any work then it will be possible.
My little student friend, I thank you for writing the letter first.
Thank you for reading Ekjam Warriors twice or thrice.
If I can take time for a new version, I will definitely try to write something for the guardian and the teacher as you say.
But I'll make an appeal to all of you.
Can you help me
I must consider them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write it in my own language, in my own way.
It may be that if your advice comes in plenty, my new version will also be confirmed.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal Alina Tayong.
My dear countrymen, you are aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through newspapers and TV.
But you know that I'm a common man like you.
I've heard that speech and watched the match.
The simplicity and transformation of the 23-year-old dancing sectarianism can affect everyone.
I must have been impressed.
Shortly before that speech, he won the Grandslam winner 19 times and finalized the tennis legend Raphael Nadal.
Someone else would be sorry to have been disappointed.
He lauded his competitors for losing his last post-competitiveness and setting a shining example of the Sportsman spirit.
Champion Nadal also complimented Danil for the game.
In the same match, the morale of the player and the humble use of the player are both learned.
If you don't listen to the speech of Daniel Medveb, I would especially urge all of you to watch the video.
It has a lot to learn for people of all ages.
Even if there is a moment, beyond defeat, these moments teach us that we don't mean defeat.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say is just for your good.
Arguments, restraint may continue, but the problem should be resolved before any matter is resolved.
Otherwise, the problem takes a big deal and solving it becomes a tough thing.
If we're awake to the heels, we can save a lot.
With this feeling, I believe that my young friends must talk about an urgent issue.
We all know how harmful the drug addiction of tobacco is to health and once it's a bad practice, it's a difficult task.
Tobaccoronicotine addiction.
The consumption of this tobacco is also harmful for the development of the brain.
We all know about these things, but today I want to inform you about a new topic.
You know, a ban on e-cigarette has been issued recently in India.
This e-cigarette is an electronic device different from usual cigarette.
e-cigarette - A chemical smoke is produced by heating the nicotine liquid material through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but there is a confusion about e-cigarettes that it is not harmful.
It uses aromatic chemicals to avoid stink like ordinary cigarettes.
We're normally watching papa chain smoker in a family, so that no one else in the family smokes.
Cigarette, the little ones in the house, to keep them away from the bed.
There is no smoke about cigarette, those who are selling, those who are buying or watching, all know that cigarette is harmful.
But the issue of e-cigarette is quite different.
There is very little awareness about this among the people.
People are not aware of the harmful aspects of e-cigarette, and this is why dedication e-cigarettes have entered the house.
Sometimes the children are playing magic in front of their parents, they are smoking without fire, they are using e-cigarettes.
You know, we smell it when someone around us ate the cigarette.
Even with cigarette packets in the pocket, it can be understood through smell.
Whether it is the youth, the ignorant or the fashion statistics, they rotate in their bags, books or in their arms, they thus fall under the shackles of this intoxication.
Youth is the future of our country.
We-cigarette obstacles have been imposed so that these new instruments of intoxication do not ruin our country, do not destroy the dreams of our families, do not destroy the lives of our children.
Anyway, this drug disease cannot be rooted in society.
I urge you all to abandon the abuse of tobacco and stop making any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India means not to go to a gym every morning and evening.
It is also called Fit India to avoid all these misconceptions.
I believe you don't feel bad about me, but it's good.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace of all such great personalities who have dedicated their lives not for themselves but for others.
Our India, our land is a multi-storeyed sage.
This country has given a lot of humanitarian gifts.
One such human being is going to be honored in Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride for all of us.
On that day Pope Francis is going to announce St. Mary Thresia.
Sister Marium Thresia, who contributed immensely to human welfare in a short span of fifty years, is a testimony to the world.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially my younger brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, at the same time, 130 crore Indians have pledged to stop the use of single-use plastic.
The way India has taken the lead in preserving the environment, the entire world is now looking at India.
I am confident that all of you will join the campaign for the next 2nd October Single Use plastic.
People are contributing to this mission in their own way.
However, a youth of our country has started a unique campaign.
His work attracts my attention and I try to understand and understand his new plan by talking to him on phone.
Maybe his words will help other people of the country.
It was new to me when I first heard the plogging word.
Perhaps this word is used at a very small level abroad.
Hello, Ripudamani, I am Narendra Modi.
This will not only take care of our health, but will also protect our mothers.
I believe that 130 crore Indians will move ahead with this objective and we will take 130 crore steps to build a single useful plastic free India.
Rippu Daman ji, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, the preparations for 2nd October are going on throughout the country and around the world, but we want to take Gandhi 150 to the path of duty.
We want to make our lives better for the country.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the dream of all of us and that is why every year on 31st October we are organizing the Run for Unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, you might remember from the Red Fort on 15th August that by 2022 you will go to fifteen places in India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there all night.
Look at India, understand, feel.
We have so many varieties.
On the occasion of Deepavali, whenever there is a holiday, all of you go to roam around and I urge you all to roam around 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has made a lot of progress in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index, and it has been possible only through your cooperation.
It's possible, especially because it understands the importance of roaming.
It means that if we try more then we will be able to achieve one place in the world in the tourism sector before the 75th year of independence.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of this diverse India.
It must be seen that in the days of Deepawali, there is no fire incident or loss of any person.
Once again, I conveyed my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, Greetings to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Deepawali, the surviving Mahaparab Chhat is one of the most rules-based festivals in our country.
Everything from food habits to dresses is conventionally followed.
Chhat Puja is fully associated with the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water at the centre of the worship of Mahaprabhot, and the utensils made of bamboo and soil, and the original, are the common materials associated with the worship of these.
It also includes the expression of the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Before Chaturbhu, all the people are united with the fervour of cleaning the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, ponds, shrines, pujas or valleys.
Surya Vandana or Chhat Puja - Conservation of the environment, prevention and discipline.
The logic behind this tradition of eating rather than prasad is that it destroys the pride and the ego that obstructs the progress of the individual.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has been tied up with the masses of this country.
Take the examples of Khadi and Handloom.
You must be glad to hear that there are so many sales in one store in Khadi and Handloom.
The sale of Khadi gift coupons during Deepawali has increased by six hundred eighty percent.
The volume of Khadi and Handicrafts has also shown an increase of nearly ninety percent this year compared to last year.
It is evident that today youngsters, elderly people, women are enjoying food and handlooms in every age group.
I can imagine how many families, poor families and the families working in handicrafts have been benefitted from this thing.
And we talked about the Khadi for Fashion but in the last few years, I have been able to say that after the Khadi for National and Khadi for Fashion, now Khadi for Transformation is taking that place.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by changing the lives of the poorest of the poor.
He's playing a very big role for Gramod.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my experience of Deepawali with the Defence Forces and he also wants to know how Deepawali is being run by the Defence Forces.
Shriman Tejas square also wrote the Narendra Modi App: What can we do to bring our homes to the defence forces
We also think of our heroic defence forces.
We also believe that we need to reach out to the youngsters of our home.
All of you must have spent Deepavali with great fervor.
Deepawali has brought a lot of experience for me.
Once again I am fortunate to celebrate Deepavali with our brave defence forces deployed on the border.
This time, Deepavali celebrations with the Defence Forces in the Gujarat sector of Jammu and Kashmir have become unforgettable for me.
On behalf of all the people of the country, I salute every soldier of our defence forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our defence forces protected the country by facing the tough situation on the border.
When we get a chance, we should know the experience of our soldiers, we should listen to their glorious stories.
Many of us do not know that our defence forces are playing a vital role in peace not only on the border but also on the whole world.
As UN Peacekeeping Forces, they are making India proud all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everybody remembers the United Nations's efforts to make peace in the world.
And we follow Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been actively contributing to the United Nations.
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with both the words Wi the People.
India has always emphasized on equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
It was proposed to introduce the Ordinance, Al-Main and Borne Free and Equivalent, which was converted into an attempt by India's representative, Hansah Mehta, and subsequently is Olhuman Beings and Borne Free and Equivalent.
Well, it seems to be a very small change, but we can see a healthy thinking in it.
India is one of the most important contributors to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always played a major role in the United Nations Peace and Education Mission.
There are people amongst you who might know this for the first time.
More than 400,000 defence personnel have contributed to UN peacekeeping efforts.
Currently, nearly seven thousand Indian soldiers are engaged in UN peacekeeping operations and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, nearly 50 of the world's sole peacekeeping efforts have contributed.
All these efforts are being carried out in various parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated and rescued in Indian Army Hospitals in Congo and South Sudan.
India's defence forces have not only protected the people of different countries, but also conquered their hearts by spreading peace and security.
Indian women have played a very leading role in the peace process.
Very few people knew that India was the first country to send women police units to Liberia for the UN Peacekeeping Campaign.
And look, India's move has been inspired by all the countries since then.
Since then, all the countries have started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to know that Indias role is not limited to peacekeeping, but also to train the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha are sending messages of peace and harmony across the world.
Peacekeeping campaign is not very helpful.
Our security forces must work in remote areas of the Jawans.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the countrymen are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force who was honoured as Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeeping Forces, who has specially acknowledged his work in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed Army Commander in Namibia's mission and served to ensure the independence of Namibia.
The former Chief of the Army Staff, General Themayya, led the UN Peacekeeping Forces at Cyprus and established itself in peace.
India is always taking the message of peace, unity and goodwill in the world as the ambassador of peace.
May everybody live a peaceful and prosperous life and move forward to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land, this India is an integral part of all the great men who have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, who is well-being and revered by Bhagwani Nivedita, is also one of these great men.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland and later called her Swami Vivekananda Nivedita.
Nivedita means who is fully dedicated.
Later, he had proved the excellent geography of his name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the welfare of the poor and the deprived.
Sister Nivedita suffered a lot from the atrocities of British Raj.
The British tried to force Indians not only physically but also mentally to accept slavery and slavery.
There was always an attempt to despise our culture inferior.
Bhagwani Nivedita reiterated the pride of Indian culture.
Inspired by national consciousness, awakened and helped in uniting the people.
He travelled across the globe to protest against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be fascinated by her diverse poems Pudumai Penn, NewWomen and Nari Sashaktikaran.
It is said that Bhagni Nivedita was the source of inspiration for all these things.
The great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose also helped him in many ways.
Through his writings and various conferences, Shri Basu has helped in both publication and publicity of all the examinations.
This is a wonderful co-existence of India where the spirituality and science of our culture is incomparable to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In 1899, a magnificent plague in Kolkata metropolitan city was swept away by a man's death in Shaw.
Sister Nivedita, ignoring her health, came forward in the Rastaghat, Narmada Safai Abhiyan.
This is the woman who gave herself away from illusions, illness and sacrificed herself for the poor and the unhappy.
Sister Nivedita, who has given everything to India, is resting here.
It's undoubtedly an universal truth.
This will be our reverence for this great personality - if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path of his displayed service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of building a New India, the hero of the future.
Your anxiety is perfect, the diseases that were seen earlier in adulthood are now being seen in your childhood.
It's really surprising that kids are victims of diabetes today.
But now there has been a lot of change in our lifestyle.
Nowadays these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main reason behind all these diseases in young age is lack of physical labor and change in food habits.
It needs to be monitored both by the society and the family.
It will be noted that there will be no unusual or terrible change.
What is needed is to focus on small things and make them their habits.
I want the people of the family to be conscious so that the kids play open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family will also join them.
Children should be habituated to walking stairs in the elevators.
After dinner, let the whole family walk with the kids.
India-Yoga will help in creating a healthy lifestyle habit of our youth and protecting them from lifestyledisorder.
Yoga is simple because yoga can be taught only.
No specific equipment or field.
Several tests are being conducted in the field of diabetes control.
A lot of work is going on in this regard, and the results that have been received so far are very optimistic.
Ayurveda and Yoga should be a part of everyday life, not merely a disease-free approach.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy in the last few days from the world of sports.
India has good news in badminton as in Hawki.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has won an excellent Kheldenmark open and has made every Indian proud.
This is his third super film after the opening of Indonesia and Australia.
I congratulate this youngster for his success and for Indias glory.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
The teams from all over the world have come to India to participate and their sporting skills have attracted us.
I had a chance to see a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic.
The World Cup is a big event, where the world is watching you.
I was surprised to see the enthusiasm, enthusiasm and inspiration of the youngsters.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all teams have demonstrated their best skills.
Even if India cannot win, the players of India have won the hearts of all.
The Festival has enjoyed India and the world over, and the entire football tournament was very entertaining for the football lovers.
The future of soccer is very bright and predictable.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, if I have to behave well with all the people about Swachh Bharat then I will have to do Mann Ki Baat every day and I will have to discuss the cleanliness of Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes the youngsters are capable of getting the Team Fort in the pictures of small children.
There is an incident of innovation on cleanliness somewhere. News has emerged once again in the work of an officer.
Just a few days ago, I got a bouquet where there is a description of the renovation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGO, called the Ecological Protection Organisation, conducted a safai drive at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
And I am surprised to see that those people who have been disappointed with the filthy atmosphere around them, they are wondering how to clean so many dirty things, they can see the pictures of this Chandrapur Fort and I will tell them about how the work, resolve, jealousy and livelihood of the youngsters of the Ecological Protection Organization have been reflected in the film.
Your disappointment, your unbelief will disappear.
This Bhagirath effort for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, dedication and serving.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all nations to protect and preserve the historical wealth.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and to all the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on 4th November.
Guru Nanakshu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is a Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire mankind, equally to all the nations and communities.
Emphasis has been laid on self-esteem and empowerment of women.
Guru Nanak Dev travelled 28,000 kilometers and spread the message of humanity in this journey.
He had met people and guided them on the path of honesty, sacrifice and work.
He didn't just say that in his life, he did his work.
He started the langarkhana and served the people.
The unity and equilibrium of eating together at the lungar is awakened.
Guru Nanak has mentioned three meditations of a positive life, name the Supreme, stay busy with labour and help the vulnerable.
Guru Nanak also wrote Guruvani for his propaganda campaign.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us move ahead with his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, and after two days on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created the scheme of modern India.
We can learn a lot from the life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had worked as a clue to India.
I had ensured crores of Indians in the umbrella of One Nation One Constitution.
His consciousness gave us the strength to overcome all barriers.
He has set a goal and in the past he has moved ahead with that goal.
He used to say: Only a person can do the work of a gang in a way that dreams of a nation that has equal rights for all.
I want Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to always inspire us.
He said that we cannot change the diversity of the nation and the community, every man and woman of India should love their own country and share the future of love and goodwill.
The words of Sardar Saheb are still the inspiration and strength of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as 'Rashtriya Ekta Diwas'.
His contribution to make our country an integral part is unforgettable.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the Run for Unity will be organised across the country where children, women, youth and elderly people will be admired.
I appeal to all of you to participate in the Run for Unity festival.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, you have come back to your daily lives with a new resolve and a new commitment.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen for fulfilling their dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat was accomplished by AIR.
Today is the 36th edition.
Most of them encourage me.
And I will take you half an hour a month, but people will continue to talk about Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
And that is why the government is also creating a simple idea of concentrating on the sensitivity of the society.
And that is why this three year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the countrymen, their thoughts and their feelings.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to my countrymen for the opportunity that I have got to share the emotions of the people of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember the words of Acharya Binoba Varma.
Acharya Binoba often used to say, non-governmental, effective.
I am sure that after three years, social scientists, universities, researchers, media experts must analyze this.
And I believe that this analysis will be very useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will bring a new consciousness and a new zeal.
And once I had said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think about our food as much as we need, we will not waste it.
But then I have seen that so many letters have come from every corner of the country, so many social organizations, so many youngsters have been doing this thing for a long time.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I see the Selfie with Daughter of a Panchayat chief in Harian and I keep it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only from India but also from all over the world, a big drive of Selfie with Daughter has been started.
A few days ago, I had been with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Send a photo wherever you go to Incredible India.
Millions of images from every corner of India have become one of the greatest treasures for those who work in the same tourism sector.
I have felt how small things create a big movement in Mann Ki Baat.
Today, I want it because when I think that it has been three years, how many things have been happening in the last three years.
The country is moving on the right path every moment.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society, for the betterment of the country.
In my three year journey of Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt it from my countrymen, I understand it, I learnt it.
This is a huge resource for any country.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction towards Khadi and I have naturally said that no one will have to study Khadi.
But there are many fabrics, why not Khadi
There may be room covers, rubbish, curtains, and it looks like Khadi's attraction has grown among the younger generation.
The sale of Khadi has increased and there has been a direct link between the poor people's employment.
On 2nd October, Khadi was discharged, a lot of discount is available.
Once again I would like to say that we should take forward the campaign for Khadi.
We are working with the idea that we will get the lamp of Deepawali in the house of the poor by buying Khadi.
The poor of our country will get a boost from this work and we should do it.
And to increase the interest of this Khadi, the Khadi sector workers and the people associated with the government of India have been encouraged to think in a new way.
How to bring new technology, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar energy and handicrafts
How can we revive the old tradition that had been closed for nearly 20, 25, 30 years
A Khadi Ashram in Sevapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh has been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Various methods have been added.
Several new job opportunities have been created.
The Khadi and Village Entrepreneurship Training Centre, which is closed in Pampore, Kashmir, has a lot to offer in this regard.
Now, for the resumption of this training centre, new generations have got help in modernizing the construction work, buying and preparing new things. And Im happy that the big corporate houses have started giving Deepawali gifts.
People are also giving a gift to each other.
We are all feeling how things can be easily developed.
My dear countrymen, we had made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we had decided that we will celebrate the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti throughout the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our respected President has started this work and the country has joined it.
Old, old, men and women, cities and villages have become a part of Swachhata Abhiyan today.
When I talk about Sankalp seminar, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is moving ahead in the path of resolution.
I've noticed that some people are working to improvise.
This time we have seen one more thing - first of all, we will clear one place, secondly, it may be that we will not make any place unconscious, but if we have to make cleanliness a habit then we need a qualitative change in our judicial system.
This time several competitions were organized in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
More than 1. 25 crore children participated in the composition on Swachhata.
Thousands of children have been painted.
They have painted to express their own imagination about cleanliness.
Whenever there is talk of cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
Our country's Electronic Media, print media, how much service can be done to the country, we are seeing it in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Recently, a few days ago, somebody focused on the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
In the last 5-6 years, Bilal has been working on cleanliness since the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest lake in Asia near Srinagar also cleans plastic, polythene, used bottles and waste.
I am glad that only Brand Ambassador was not constructed by Mr. Mr.
Bilal Dar is a young but inspiring person who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must admit that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk about history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel in October this month, many great men who have led us in the 18th century and the 21st century, have shown us the path of walking and for the country who have suffered a lot.
When former President of India, Mr. Abdul Kalamji spoke to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
In a deep sense, he mentioned the scheme and himself went to the village to witness the work of Nanaji.
Remembering these great men, we remind them not to be of any benefit to them, so that they can find a way forward so that they get the right direction for the future.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We have been saying that unity in diversity is the uniqueness of India.
We are proud of diversity, do we ever try to realize that diversity that we are proud of
I would like to tell all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially my young people that we are in a state of consciousness.
Feel the separation of India, touch it, realize its pride.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't mind, but sometimes you'll see your home too
The people of North India don't know what is in South India
Wouldn't the people of western India know what is there in East India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalamji visited India then a new inspiration for the country was created to see, understand the country.
These great men have seen the country in a big way.
In the beginning of their work, they tried to understand and understand India.
We have tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we not imagine that the different states of our country, the rules and regulations of different societies, their dresses, their clothing, eating habits should be learnt as a student, they should be able to understand and earn their livelihood
There will be value addition in tourism only when we are not just audiences but also a student who will be able to realise, understand and imbibe the characteristics of all those places.
I have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of my own Hindustan.
We have also experienced night stay in more than four and a half districts.
Today, when I am taking this privileged responsibility of the country, it is my experience of visiting this place.
That's why I have a lot of advantages to understand.
My request to you people is that in this large India, unity in diversity is not just a slogan.
If one kind of new food is eaten every day for life, it will not be repeated.
This is a great strength for our tourism.
I would like to say that on this vacation, you just went out of the house for a little change.
Your concerns will be enormous.
What can be a bigger teacher than you know
Normally, from October to March, the time is extensive for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them pictures.
Not only the architecture or the architecture there, but also the beauty of the people there.
Please send all the excellent documents on your journey to MyGov and send them to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen this thing that in order to improve the tourism industry of India, if you want to know about the seven best tourist destinations of your own state, then every Indian should know about these seven things of his state.
If possible, we'll have to go to the seven places.
Can you give me any information about this
You see, if everybody in the same state sends these information, I will tell the government to scrutinize them, and make publicity about the seven common issues that come from every state.
That is, how can we improve tourist destination from the inspiration of a human being
Similarly, among the seven things that you have seen in the entire country, you have the pleasure of seeing someone or the other, you need to know about it, then you must send the names of seven such places of your choice to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on this.
The government will accept the decisions taken by you people to create films, create videos, create publicity literature and give a befitting reply.
Come, join me.
You can also be a major driver of tourism development from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, for being a human being, a lot of things touch my heart and stop my mind.
I have a deep impact.
Because I'm a man like you.
Just a few days back, perhaps your vision has attracted a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
Lt. Swati and Nidhi, the Indian Armed Forces, have enjoyed a brilliant semen.
It is a wonderful thing that the husband of wealth and wealth had been martyred to serve Mother India.
We can imagine how the world will get worse when it's young.
But the martyr colonel Santosh Mahadwar's wife Swati Mahadik fought against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to realize his husband's dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, her husband, Mukesh Dubey used to serve as a hero in the army and when he was martyred for the motherland, his wife Nidhi decided to accept it and she too joined the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to respect our women power and respect these brave hearts.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
They have given a new inspiration, a new consciousness to millions of people of the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between the festival of Navratri and Deepawali is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA under-17 is happening here.
I believe we can hear soccer soccer.
Each generation will be attracted to soccer.
There will be no school-college field in India where our youngsters will not be able to play football.
Come, when the entire world is playing on the soil of India, we will also make this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire environment is full of auspicious fragrance.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country, to the mother power, to the hopes and aspirations of the common man of our country.
May the country have the power to tackle every challenge.
May the country progress at a rapid pace and in 2022, in the 75 years of India's independence, we have started our journey by creating a road map of five years to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters, the resolve of 125 crore countrymen, the hard work, the hard work of many men and women.
My best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate Festivals and inspire enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, greetings
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel, who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, the universal values, non-violence and harmony that our ancestors have embraced are linked to our lives.
Ahimsa Param Dharma - We have been listening to it since childhood.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be enforced in the name of faith, it can be a communal belief, it can be a belief in political ideology or a person can believe in any tradition.
Nobody has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us the Constitution, the right to inculcate the goodwill of every person there.
I want to assure the countrymen that the government or the country will not force anybody, individuals or communities who go on the path of violence against those who have taken the law.
Everyone has to be censored to the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly related to farmers and fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all, I would like to call you "Michami Dukkadam".
Yesterday, the Sambatri festival of Jain society was celebrated.
In the Jain community, 'Purushan Parab' is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Commemorative Festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also known as the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of conveying good wishes to each other as 'Michami Dukkadam'.
Besides, our scriptures are the land of forgiveness, bravery and bravery.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great zeal and enthusiasm.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi was spoken, the issue of universal gathering comes naturally.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and sanctity.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to the people of our country.
Now the Omna Festival is being celebrated in Kerala.
Omna is one of the most important festivals of Kerala.
This festival is special for its social and cultural importance.
The Omna Festival reminds us of the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has become a centre of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell my countrymen that like the Navratri festival of Gujarat or the Durga Festival of West Bengal, today it has become the main attraction of tourism.
There is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Id-ul-uha will be celebrated soon after this festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals and Swachhata are part of our family life.
Preparations for the festival begin with cleanliness.
It is not new but it is very important to transform cleanliness in a social way.
Universal Swachhata not only in our homes but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country, this cleanliness and festival will have to be tied to a thread that will be unbroken.
My dear countrymen, the language of modernisation is changing gradually.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
On YouTube, you will see that today the children are building statues of Ganesha with soil in their homes.
The cleanliness drive that we had launched three years ago is the third anniversary of October 2nd.
On one such occasion, the officers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat have taken up the entire task of cleaning and cleaning 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods.
If this effort to dedicate ourselves to cleanliness becomes a permanent part of our nature, then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I urge you all to come, once again, on 2nd October, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, I would like to begin the campaign of Swachhata Hi Seva, just as I was told earlier, Jal Seva is the Lord Seva and Swachhata Hi Seva.
We are creating an environment conducive to cleanliness across the country.
And whenever we get a chance, we find and utilize it.
Please work.
Work together on holidays or Sundays.
Go to the neighbouring colonies, go to the nearby villages, make it a movement.
I appeal to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat chiefs to create such an atmosphere just fifteen days before Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary on 2nd October so that the India of Gandhiji's dream is realized.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, mygov.
In-A, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can list your own names and the names of those families which you have helped in this work.
My social media friends can play some creative campaigns in the virtual world that can be really inspiring.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation organises short-term film and film drawing competitions under Swachh Sankalp Se Swachh Siddhi campaign.
You can write articles in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Out of the participants, three at the district level and three at the state level will be selected and rewarded.
I urge you to participate in the Swachhata Abhiyan in the same way.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions and millions of people sometimes send letters, messages or telephone calls, send a message which is a supreme achievement and rare asset to me.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the thoughts and feelings of the people of the country.
I look forward to waiting for you more than what you people are waiting for.
I look forward to waiting because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, hear, read and know your opinion as much as possible.
Prime Minister, I am calling Oparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a bad guy I'm surprised to see.
I went to bed with him once to buy.
I see he bought a two-thousand-rupee sari, spent Rs.450 for the pizza.
At the same time, he spent a long time with Autowallers for five rupees to go to Mal.
He did the same thing while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four-five pieces.
I felt very bad.
We spend a lot of money in the big shops without any punishment, but we bow down to our hardworking brothers and sisters for a little bit of money.
I believe that after listening to the speech of this phone, you have decided not only to wake up but to make such a mistake.
Do you think that whenever someone comes to selling things around our house, comes to ferrying, we are working with a small shopkeeper or a soap seller, sometimes we need an auto-revenue - whenever we work with a caretaker, we pay less than Rs.
And when people like us go to a large restaurant to eat food, don't see what is written in the bill, I'll get the money out immediately.
Not only this, I don't care if I buy saris in the showroom, but if I work with a poor person, I don't give up.
There will be no mischief in your life for two rupees, five rupees, but have you ever thought of how much this little behaviour hurts his mind
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message with such a heart-breaking call.
I believe that if my countrymen have the habit of such behavior with the poor then they will definitely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire nation celebrates the National Sports Day.
The day marks the birth anniversary of Major Dhyan Chand ji, the great hockey player and the magician of the hockey.
His contribution to Holi is unparalleled.
I am reminded of this thing because I want to connect with the new generation of sports in our country.
Let sports become part of our lives.
If we are the Tarun Nation of the world, we should also look at the playground.
Playing means physical fitness, mental alarm, personality enhancing.
Playing on one side is a nice prayer for heart interference.
May the young generation of our country move ahead in the field of sports and in the era of computers, I would like to make sure that the flying fields are more important than the plate stations.
Play in the computer, but even in the fields outside, sometimes perform hard with soccer.
Perhaps a cricket movie on the computer, but the fun of playing cricket under the sky is different on the open ground.
Today, the situation is such that the kids start watching cartoons in one corner of the house or they get rubbed in a mobile game and then they start screaming and telling their mother - when will you go out
Time changes, she was an era when she told her son, when did you come and today she had to tell her, Dad, when will you go out
Young friends, the Sports Ministry has created a sports talent search portal to find and develop sports talents, where any child from all over the country, who has achieved some achievements in sports, has a talent, he can upload his bio-data or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry is launching it tomorrow.
We are happy to note that the Seventeen World Cup will be held in India from October 6-28, 2019.
Twenty-four teams of the world are going to make India their home.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from the world to the festival of sports, let us enjoy sports and create an appropriate environment in the country.
Today, when I talk about sports, I recall one of the most important events of the last week, I want to share with my countrymen.
I got the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas who never had any connection with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy, their emotions, their enthusiasm will inspire us all.
These six daughters, carrying a small boat - I-NS Tarini, will go through the sea.
The expedition has been called Nabika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India after a few months after the world tour.
Sometimes forty days in water.
Sometimes he'll spend thirty days together in water.
Between the waves of the sea, our brave six daughters, and this is the first thing in the world.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of these daughters
I salute the feelings of these girls and I have told them to share their thoughts with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their thinking on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because, on one hand, it will be a sense of courage, a feeling of self-confidence, and I will be glad to convey these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, the blessings of the waves.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan.
He was the President but for the rest of his life he made himself a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a devoted life to education.
The glorious qualities of a teacher awaken the spirit of creation and enjoyment of wisdom among his students.
Can we start a campaign in a mission mode
When we talk about transformation in our country, the way we remember the mothers of the family, similarly the role of teachers in the society will be remembered.
Teachers have a huge role in transformation.
Every teacher has a transformational technologies in his life and we are trying our best.
It will play a very big role in the transformation of the country.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of Teach to Transform.
My name is Dr. Anupa Awasthi.
I am associated with the residents of Mumbai and the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
The scheme was launched in 2014 with a dream beginning on 28th August.
Tomorrow, three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed on 28th August.
30 crore Indians have participated in this scheme and opened their first bank account.
The number of new Accountant Citizens is more than that of many countries in the world.
If you have money at home or in pockets, you're thinking about the cost.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the poor people of our country have deposited about 65 thousand crore rupees.
Again, those who have opened the accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also got the benefit of insurance.
The Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana, Pradhan Mantri SurakshaBimaYojana, with a premium of just one and three rupees, has created a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
In many families, when these poor people have become embarrassed, the head of the family has died, the benefits of one premium have been found to be two lakh rupees.
I have been told about the encouraging results of the Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the benefits of insurance for the common man.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, "Muchchi Dukkadam"
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
The hearts of the people are such that the rainy season is very pleasant to the people.
Animals, birds, plants, nature - everyone is happy with the arrival of rains.
But sometimes when it takes a terrible form, it can be understood how much water destructive power is.
Nature is our lifelong, our native, but sometimes floods, natural surroundings like earthquakes, and their terrible forms are devastating.
There is a negative impact on the changes in the cycle and the changes in the environment.
During the last few days, in some parts of India, especially in the North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, natural calamities have been caused due to heavy rains.
Flood devastation is being monitored.
The rescue is being carried out extensively.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are on their way.
The state government is making every effort to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens wishing to do service are making all efforts to reach out to the people in this situation.
It affects agriculture, animals, infrastructure, electricity, connectivity etc.
In particular, for the loss of crops and farm produced by our farmer brothers, we have formulated a scheme to ensure that the insured companies, especially agricultural insurance companies, can play a positive role so that the climate change of the farmers can be achieved at a rapid pace.
People are talking about their old age.
Before the rainy season, most of the mock drills were put in place to prepare the entire government programme.
The NDRF team was appointed.
Gradually, we have created such a thing that according to the forecast of the year, we will do our job in such a way that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country who are more than me.
This time there have been so many letters about GST, so many phone calls, and people are still expressing happiness about GST, asking questions.
I would like to tell you that Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am talking to Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I am extremely impressed by your statement on Chartered Accountant Day.
This is the reason in our country that today's Goods and Service Tax-GST has started.
I'd like to hear your opinion about this.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month since the GST was launched and its fruitful results are visible.
And I am glad that whenever a poor man has written a letter, how the prices of the poor have come down for GST, how the goods have become cheaper.
Anyone living in the north-eastern region, far-flung areas, and forests insists that they were scared earlier or not, but now when I have learnt and understood this thing then I feel that the work has become easier than before.
Business has become very simple.
And the biggest thing is that the confidence of the consumers is increasing.
Now I have seen the impact of GST on the Transport and Logistics Sector.
How the truck has grown.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transition, in which there is a strong migration, a new registration and this has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, economists, eminent personalities of management, scholars of Technologies, through their research, they must use GST in India as a model for the world.
It will become a Case Study for various universities of the world.
This is because such a big change in such a large measure, the participation of such a large number of millions of people, its use and success in such a large country, it is a matter of success in itself.
The world must research this.
GST has been used, every state has participated in it, every state has its own responsibility.
All decisions have been taken jointly by the States and the Centre.
And as a result, the primary goal of every government is that there should not be any pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the Departments, all the Central and State Governments associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias shared energy.
This is a historical experience.
This is also a campaign for social reforms.
I once again bow down to millions and millions of people to make such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the month of August.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
What happened to our new generations on 9th August 1942
From 1857 to 1942, how much they had to face with the aspirations of the people of India, how much they had to endure, how much they had to endure, how much their descriptions in the pages of history inspired us to build a better India.
It was at a time when every corner of Hindustan, everywhere in the cities, everywhere in the villages, educated, uneducated, everybody shouldered shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with the uit India Movement.
Millions of Indians have dedicated their lives to the struggle of 'Karenge Ya Murenge' at the call of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 9th August, when Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement, the British embarked on all the big leaders and then proceeded to take the movement forward.
Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan is the second generation leader.
In the 1920 'Association Movement' and 'uit India' movement of 1942, two different aspects of Mahatma Gandhi were displayed.
In the 42nd stage, the intensity of the movement increased so much that the great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karenge Yamarenge'.
Behind all these achievements were public support, peoples participation, peoples participation and peoples participation.
The whole country fought together that day.
I sometimes imagine that the first freedom struggle of India was in 1857 when we collected the leaves of history.
The war that began in 1857, by 1942, has now reached some part of the country and in this long time it has created a strong demand for freedom in the heart of the country.
Every person is committed to something or the other.
Generations have changed, but their resolve has not yet been intensified.
A group of people have come, have joined the struggles, have left, new teams have come and they have joined the struggle in the same way. And they have made every effort to bring the British empire back to the country.
From 1857 to 1942, it brought the movement to such a level that reached its peak in 1942, and the toxin of Bhadrachho was ruined in such a way that the British migrated to 1947 in five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, freedom came to every country and from 1942 to 1947, the five decisive years of solemn pledge marked the fulfilment of the country's independence.
These five years were the main determinants.
Now I want to connect with this process.
In 1947, we became free and in 2017.
It's been 70 years.
The government's here.
The rules and regulations have been framed, changed and enhanced.
Everyone has done their best to get rid of the countrys problems.
There is a constant effort to increase the income of the common man in the country, to eradicate poverty.
Expectations have increased.
We will celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as the beginning of the solemn pledge and at the time of 75 years of independence in 2022, we will fulfil that pledge.
Forty-five years from 1942 to 2022, the year 2022 will be the crucial year for Indias future.
After five years, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A solemn pledge that we will show in the next five years.
Come, use technology to come forward with new ideas like video posts, blogs, records, new ideas.
This movement has to be transformed into a mass movement.
The Narendra Modi App will also host the uit India uiz competition for young friends.
The uiz competition is an attempt to make the youth of the country aware of the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that in the last three years, I have received a lot of suggestions from every corner of the country on what should be said on 15th August, the main objective of these proposals is to make their dreams a sound.
On 15th August, I will try to discuss these proposals in whatever time I get.
I'll finish in 40-45 or 50 minutes if it's too much.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about another thing.
Socio-economics is closely linked to Indias economy.
It's not supposed to be rude.
Our festivals are not just for joy and joy.
Our festivals and festivals are indeed a mission of social reforms, together with each of our festivals, directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor in the country.
After a few days, there will be festivals like Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Chaturveda, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepavali etc.
A simple joy is also associated with this festival.
A few months before the Rakhibandhan Festival, hundreds of families have become deprived of small family businesses.
Several types of treasures are observed in a variety of ways like Suti, Silk, etc. and nowadays people prefer to keep homemade.
Hundreds of thousands of businessmen are associated with a festival like Rakhi, sellers, sweet businessmen.
Deepawali is directly related to the poor families of the poor.
Today, when I talk about festivals, festivals and the economy of the poor people associated with it, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of our country are more aware and active than I am.
Awakening citizens wrote to me about the last one month's surroundings.
They have appealed to me that whenever I talk about eco-friendly Ganesh on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi so that the people like earth-made ganesh.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of the Ganesh festival.
125th year and 125 crore Indians.
The Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was organised in front of the spirit of social unity, conscious society and social reform.
Come, let us also recall him and organize compositions, seminars etc. during the Ganesh festival this year.
Come, let us link this festival with the economy of the poor, let us enjoy our festivals as the economic festivals of the poor, let us enjoy economic joyment.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivities.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to new heights in education, financial sector, social sector or sports.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honoured for them.
Just a few days back, we have shown great talent in the women's cricket struggle.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet all these playing girls.
They had a mark on their faces.
I have spoken of a different assessment of these girls.
I have seen such a game that if the players of India are fascinating then the anger of the people of the country is overwhelming.
Some people say something that breaks the honour, something that is very painful.
Not only this, girls praised her and gave her respect.
I have seen a beautiful change in this thing, and I have told these girls that this is your good fortune.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
In fact, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, have done a lot to brighten the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August movement and once again I would like to recall it on 9th August.
May every citizen of the country take a pledge of five years to fulfil his resolve.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with this belief that the future of the country will be better.
Mann Ki Baat, June, 2017
Weather is changing.
It was so hot this time.
But fortunately, the rainy season has been following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, it feels comfortable with the cold winds of the past.
All of us have seen that whatever kind of excitement or anxiety may be there in personal life or in public life, the coming of rain but it makes us mentally retarded.
Today, the chariot of Lord Jagannath Dev is being celebrated in different parts of the country with enthusiasm and joy.
Today, the chariot of Lord Jagannath Dev is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are specially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English which means a beautiful chariot whose speed cannot be stopped.
It is obvious that this word has come from Jagannath Devrath.
This means that the people of the world have accepted the importance of Jagannath Dev's journey according to their own accord.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Idul Fitr.
Come, let us collectively take inspiration from this festival and take the country forward by distributing happiness stores.
In this month of Ramzan, I came to know about an inspirational incident in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, nearly half a thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in this small village, most of them belong to Muslim families.
In this month of Ramzan, everyone in the village decided to build toilets together.
17 lakhs has been provided to the government for construction of private toilets.
You will be happy to hear that even in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters have returned the government's 17 lakh rupees.
17 lakh will be spent on other services.
On the occasion of social development, I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
Everything is very inspiring.
Most importantly, they have made Barakpur an open defecation-free area.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration and the people of this state for completing this work.
We are well aware that we have to work hard to do something good in personal life or social life.
If my handwriting is bad, I have to make a lot of conscious efforts to fix it.
This is how physical and psychological changes occur.
It's the same thing as cleanliness.
Some bad habits have become our nature.
Everybody needs to focus.
Inspiring events will also be remembered again and again.
I am glad that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is taking the shape of a mass movement in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people then the strength increases naturally.
I am reminded of a good thing that I want to tell you.
This happened in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their target was to build 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the task of constructing 10,000 toilets in the local administration has been accomplished in 100 hours.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In a letter, all these suggestions are received in the AIR.
There is a need to be conscious of democracy and that is why it is necessary to remind them of such incidents that hurt democracy and promote goodwill for democracy.
On 25th June, 1947, a black day that no Indian can forget about democracy.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voices of the opposition were stunned.
Eminent leaders of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were arrested.
The judicial system didn't get rid of the terrible situation.
The newspaper was completely unnecessary.
Students from today's journalism also recall the dark day and are consistently striving to increase awareness about democracy.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed at that time.
Atal ji wrote a poem on the occasion of the Emergency Year, describing the psychological condition of his time in that poem.
We have to strengthen this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of himself by raising his head in the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world witnessed Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the rays of sun through yoga every morning.
Is there any Indian who will not be proud of it
It would not have happened before, but today when Yoga is tied up, Yoga has become a cause of complication for the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have adopted the objective of this Yoga.
On the one hand, in China, the Great Wall of China has engaged people, on the other hand, Peru's Worldheritage Site is about 2,400 meters above sea level.
The Eiffel Tower was shadowed by people in France.
More than four thousand people have joined the United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi.
In the Herats of Afghanistan, India-Afghan Friendship Dam has given India a new dimension of friendship by associating itself with the SAM.
In a small country like Singapore, there have been seventy-seven programs and they have run a campaign throughout the week.
The United Nations has released ten postage stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Headquarters of the United Nations, Yoga specialists have been conducting Yoga sessions.
UN employees, worldwide diplomaters participated in this.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, nearly 50,000 people have joined together and created a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But it is my privilege to join the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers are also employed in Siachen, which is 20, 25, 40 degrees Celsius.
Our Armed Forces, be it BSF, ITBP, C-R-P-FHOC, CI-SF, all have participated in Yoga along with their duties.
On the occasion of Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that the three generations of the family are together photographs shared by them.
Some TV channels have taken this forward.
I've got a lot of photographs about this, some of them are select photographs and kept the Narendra Modi app.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to attend a very dear institution.
For a few days, a very good programme has been organized in Kerala, a habit of reading amongst people through PENPONICKA Foundation, a lot of encouragement in reading books, hence reading day and reading moth are being celebrated.
I had a chance to go to the beauties and I was told that we didn't get flowers, we gave them books.
My good luck.
This time, I also remembered the fact that I was out of my concentration.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a system in the government that we will not raise, we will give it or we will welcome it with a handkerchief.
He will be a man of Khadi so that he will grow up in Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here I left that habit.
But the habit of going to Kerala awakened again.
And I've started giving a notice to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
Flowers are very low in life.
Once you have to take it off your hands.
But if I give the book then it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
I went to London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me.
How many years have passed since ueen Elizabeth had taken care of Mahatma Gandhi's handkerchief.
And she showed me with great pleasure to go.
I didn't know if he wanted to touch me once.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change nights and sometimes there is a criticism in saying such things.
But in spite of this, such a thing should be highlighted, efforts should be made.
Now I can't say that I'm somewhere else and someone's gone with flowers, then I'll tell him no, I can't do it.
However, it will be a matter of discussion, but it should continue to change gradually.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work remains in the process of becoming the Prime Minister.
I have to immerse in the files, but I have made a habit of reading some of the letters that I have received and this way I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of people wrote letters.
I've read a letter like this.
A housewife, Arulmozhi, from the far southern Tamil Nadu, has written a very good letter.
What you are writing in that letter - I thought of doing something to tackle my world, to tackle children's education so that there could be some financial support.
Likewise, I started lending some loans from the banks under the Mudra Yojana and getting some goods from the market.
In the meantime, the government has started a system called Governance e-Marketplace.
So I'm registering myself in the investigation.
Anyone who wants to supply any goods to the government, there can be electric bulbs, can ask for supplies of dustbins, brooms, chairs, tables, whatever you want to sell, you can register.
He wrote, First of all, I got the money from the Mudra Yojana and started my business, then I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office PMO.
It was an unknown news to me, asking me what the PMO wanted to buy
He said he bought thermos and got 1600 payments.
Yeah, that's Empowerment.
It has transparency, empowerment, entrepreneurship as well.
Government-Marketplace-GEM.
I would like to say that the number of people who want to sell something to the government continues to grow.
I understand this is an unparalleled example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its aim is Minimum Price and Maximumesee, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we can take pride in Yoga and also take pride in the success of Space Science.
This is India's specialty, Yoga has spread to the soil of our country and it is our country in the far flung space expedition.
Earlier, India had shown many successes in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the planet but also on the space.
ISRO has also launched 30 nanosatellites with Cartosat-24 satellites two days ago.
Apart from India, 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and America have joined these satellites.
These nano satellites in India will also provide immensely useful information on the nano-satellites in the field of agriculture, for the benefit of farmers.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Just imagine how our scientists have established space research.
On June 19th, it was a thousand days of Mars Mission.
You all remember that for this Mars mission, we had successfully established it in orbit and it was fixed for six months.
It was six months old.
But what an extraordinary skill of our scientists has achieved a thousand days beyond six months.
Our scientific journey, which has been completed for a thousand days, is guiding us to our space exploration.
Our younger generations have been brightening their skills and their physical capabilities in the field of education as well as sports.
This is the day when India's badminton player Kidambi Championships in Indonesia and Spain have enhanced the honour of the country.
I congratulate this retired Srikanth and his coach.
T.
Sportspersons play a vital role in development.
Sports contributes significantly to the development of a holistic personality.
There is no shortage of patriotism in the country.
If the kids and daughters of the family are bent on sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, the countrymen, the rainy season, the festival of festivals are celebrated in a way.
What's your mind, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you people, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
In the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the people of the world, especially the people of the Muslim community.
During Ramzan, special emphasis is given to prayers, spirituality and compassion.
We are very fortunate to be Hindustani. Our forerunners have created such a tradition that Indians can take pride in it.
We can take pride in the fact that there are people from all over the world in India.
This is a nation that believes in God or Nastika who worships idols or who has achieved the strategies of living together in the form of idol worshipping , all kinds of thinking , all kinds of worshipping rituals and all kinds of traditions .
And be it religion, community, ideology or tradition, it gives us only one message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will help in furthering this current of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes.
Last time when I had used Mann Ki Baat, I had used a word, especially the youngsters, to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this is the age of survival - a little risky, adventurous.
I'm glad many people gave me feedback.
Personally, they encouraged me to talk to me.
There are so many messages that I can't fall, I can't even listen to the messages sent by everyone.
However, I have noticed that some people are trying to learn songs, some are listening to new musical instruments, some are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn new languages, some are learning kitchens, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some are writing poems.
My reading habits were almost shut down.
That's why I tried to read this vacation.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized that how much struggle was made for India's freedom struggle, how many freedom fighters had spent years in jail.
I was inspired by the life of Bhagwad Singh, who had done a lot in a very young age.
That's why I request you to tell me something about this in today's festival.
I am glad that todays youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar many years ago.
I went to see Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar sat in jail and wrote the book "Manji Janmath".
Writing poems on the prison wall.
She was kept locked in a small house.
There was so much to suffer for freedom.
When I read the book "Manji Janmath" of Savarkar ji, I get inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no such state in Hindustan, there are no linguistic people who did not suffer from drinking water for the sake of freedom. Andaman jail did not kill their lives in this cellular jail.
If you ever get a chance, you will definitely go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of June 5th.
And this year, the theme of the United Nations is Connecting People toNature.
In other words ' back to basics ' .
And someone else said something better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has said many times: "One must carry about a world one will not see". It is our duty to think and take care of the world we have not seen.
When we get tired, we open the door and breathe fresh air.
When we are connected to the Panchbhav, we are connected to that Panchbhav, then we have a new life and a new energy in our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think of it, we couldn't tie it in a rope.
After that you will definitely see that whenever you are associated with various natural conditions, a new consciousness will emerge within you.
And that is why on 5th June, we should have our own campaigns worldwide to connect with nature.
We get some results of what our ancestors have done to protect the environment.
If we preserve the environment, our next generation will have its results.
In Vedas, the world and the environment are considered to be the root of energy.
We are called Maternal Land: Son of the Earth:
It is said in the Vedas that the sanctity that we have is for our world.
Earth is our mother and we are his children.
If we think of Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his wisdom and his Mahaparinirvana were three in the trees.
But we need to connect him with modern words and modern debates.
At this time, I get news from different states.
With the onset of rains, a big drive for planting trees has started in almost all the states.
Millions of trees are planted.
The world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, on 21st June, the World Yoga Day has expanded everywhere and is involving people.
On the one hand, many powers that discriminate in the world are showing its distorted forms, at this time World Yoga Day is a major contribution of India.
Through Yoga, we have bound the entire world together.
The way Yoga binds the body, mind, intellect and soul together, Yoga binds the world together today.
Yoga has a major role to play in ensuring a stress-free life in the situation of consumption of opposite medicines and passing away.
Yoga is not just an exercise but it is possible only through yoga exercise that it is possible to feel the fusion of body, mind, judgement and this fusion.
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to the government of all the countries of the world, to all the leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga related competitions and announced some awards.
A funny proposition.
He said, This is the third International Day of Yoga, I would like to urge all the three generations of yoga exercises of the same family on this third International Day of Yoga.
Whether grandparents or grandparents or grandparents , parents , sons and daughters should practice yoga together for three generations and upload their photos.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a lucky combination of Yoga will showcase a new dimension.
I thank you for this proposal and I believe that as we have carried out the drive of Selfie with Daughter, we have created a joyous feeling, the pictures of these three generations of yoga will create a stir in the entire country and the world.
You must have sent me a picture in the 'My Gov' through the Narendra Modi App, where people of three generations are working together.
Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow, it will be a beautiful garland.
I invite all of you.
There are about three weeks left for International Yoga Day.
Start a habit from today.
You should also spread the message of Yoga for three weeks and involve people.
This is the movement of a kind of Preventive Health Care.
I invite all of you to participate in this.
Since the time you have assumed the charge as the Chief Servant, and from the Red Fort, I had got the opportunity to speak on the 15th of August that I had talked about cleanliness.
I have been visiting different parts of India since that day.
Modi ji, on TV and on social media, I see that wherever you are going, all the people here are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have accepted cleanliness as a mission in your call.
Children have also become aware of cleanliness with the elderly.
Sometimes the younger grown-ups seem to mess them up.
The cleanliness that you have started from the valley of Kashi has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I am going, there is a government safai karam safai karam safai ki safai ki samadhi.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
There will be other preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but the first is Swachhata.
It will automatically enjoy anyone who is in a transparent manner.
I would like to thank everyone for emphasizing on this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a proposal.
It's a funny proposition.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji, when you go to any invitation, tell me, if you invite me, what level of cleanliness will be, how many tons of garbage will you give me gifts, on that basis I will decide to go.
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Again, there must be a movement, and a few tons of waste will be cleaned instead of other things.
How many people will we save from sickness.
How big a humanity will be.
Once we consider it as wealth, new ways of waste management will come forward.
Youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with new ideas, new instruments and new instruments.
It is expected that these 4,000 cities will be covered with dry waste, blue dustbin and wet waste will be disposed of in green dustbin.
Waste of kitchens, such as vegetarian peels, chicken pox, egg-open, tree-food leaves, all these waste-green dustbin.
All these things are those things which are used in agriculture, if you keep in mind the greenery of the food then you will remember what to do with the green dustbin.
The remaining waste materials like waste paper, iron, cardboard, glass, plastic, polythene, rubber and other metallic wastes are dry wastes which are required to be recycled and recycled.
I believe that we can develop a habit like this and if we need to take new steps for cleanliness then we will be able to fulfil the dreams that Gandhiji dreamt of cleanliness.
Today, I would like to mention with pride that if a person takes his mind then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
In the last few days, you must have heard a news, the stinking Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean and clean Barsoba Beach today.
It wasn't a sudden, a citizen worked for 80-90 weeks to change the image of Barsova Beach. Thousands of tons of waste have been cleaned, cleaned, beautiful.
And it's the responsibility of Versova Residence Volunteer.
An individual, Shriman Afroz Shah, gradually became a member of the public movement since October 2015.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) awarded Afroz Shah for this purpose.
He was the first Indian to be awarded the Championsof the Earth Award.
I knew that the local women were leading the most.
They used to take torch to create awareness among the masses, in every street, in every household, they inspired everyone to do this.
I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I also compliment the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for a beautiful launch by making a Block Open Defecation Free.
My dear countrymen, for the last three years of the present government, there have been regular discussions in newspapers, TV channels and social media in the last 15 days.
Three years ago, you took over as the Chief Servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I would like to thank all those who have given critical and important feedback, and have got the opportunity to take it steadfastly in view of misconceptions, shortcomings etc.
This criticism is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, because of this a small citizen like me and you, I feel the same kind of impact that a small citizen has on good and bad things.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a little human being, as a little citizen, it's a big impact on my mind, it's inspired me.
I am grateful to Mr. Akbar.
Come, let us all move ahead in this environment with love and affection.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And we are witnessing the curiosity of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation, and the essence of the elderly.
Every time the inputs received for Mann Ki Baat are analyzed before the government.
What are the suggestions, what are the complaints, what are the feelings of people, etc.
The motor shows that the nature of the people is advisory to others.
On the train, if anyone wants to go to the bus, do this with others.
But when I tried to take care of these things, I was overwhelmed.
Most of the people sent suggestions, they tried to reach me, who really did something in their own life.
They have tried to do some good work in accordance with their intellect, strength, capability and opportunities.
And when I realized this, I felt that these suggestions weren't a bit of a bit.
It's from the roots of the people's feelings.
Some people feel that if people listen to these things when they are working, they will be able to produce a comprehensive form of work, so many people can benefit from it.
Not only this, when I mention any of these things, I recall and feel very happy.
I have never imagined that our country, especially the younger generation, has been working on this thing for a long time.
Over the years, I knew that some socio-economic organisations have been working on this topic, but I can very soon know that the youngsters of my country are working on this thing.
Many sent me a video.
There are many places where bread is being run.
People collect their bread from the bread bank, deposit their bread, and collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving, they love it, and those who are doing it, they don't think they're small.
This is an example of how social cooperation works.
This is the last day of April.
The fifteenth fair was recognized as Gujarat and Maharashtra Angarajya.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States have worked towards achieving new goals of development and have worked for the betterment of the country.
And in both the states, the arrival of the great men and their livelihood in every sphere of society continues to inspire us.
Remembering the great men on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the two states, we should resolve to scale new heights of our states, our nations, our societies, our cities, our families, 75 years after Independence in 2022.
Plans should be taken to make this resolve a reality, and all citizens should further enhance their efficiency.
It is time to feel the warmth of our country and abroad in March-April.
When I was taking advice from people in Mann Kibat, I had suggested what should be done in this summer.
Nothing is new, but it is useful to re-think it at a particular time.
And I have seen that the family members are doing this very well.
Once they realize why this water should be filled, then ten times a day they go to see if there is water in the vessel or not.
And the birds are coming or seeing.
I think this is a game, but it is a unique way to really refresh the sympathy of the boys.
In our country, we must live together with the animals and birds, colour them, yet we must emphasize our collective endeavours to protect them.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a hundred years of the Dharmaguru of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj was completed.
He was alive for 103 years.
And for his centenary celebrations, the Bohra community has launched a massive campaign to save the slopes through the Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to host this expedition.
Approximately thirteen thousand bird feeders spread them at the corners of the world.
This campaign has taken place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I have become so busy that I have forgotten to give some water to those who come to my house with newspapers, with milk papers, with vegetables and postman.
Young friends, I would like to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our youngsters are enjoying living with the comfort zone.
Their parents have grown up among their aggretopes.
Some people lead a life of extreme adversity, but most people live this life of comfortzone.
Now the exams are over, so many plans have been made to enjoy the holidays.
It's fun to get warm in the summer.
I would like to talk about how your vacation will be done as a friend.
I believe some people will contribute to me and inform me.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching things on TV or reading books or listening to familiar people and feeling themselves.
Be test-examination positive, just like a bit out of the comfortzone.
We are the middle class, the happy family.
Friends, Have you ever thought that without reservation, we should take a ticket and sit in the second class room of the train for 24 hours
Sometimes feel it, I don't mean to take it out, but do it once or twice.
Early in the morning, walking with your football, volleyball or other sports equipment in a very poor settlement.
Play with those poor boys, you will see that you have never enjoyed this joy of playing in life before.
When these children who live in the society will get the opportunity to meet you, do you think how big changes will be brought about in the lives of those children
This experience will give you a lot of experience.
Many voluntary organizations are doing this service.
Sometimes a lot of summer camps are organized for personality development and it can be included in this thing.
If you are a member of the Summer Camp, you are a person of personality development, you must go freely to all those people of the society who have been deprived of these sub-categories and teach them what you have learnt.
How to do this, you can teach.
Our concern is that the technology that has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six people in the same house, but the difference between them has increased so much that is imaginative.
Everyone is busy with new technology.
Living together is also a reform, one is energy.
Secondly, I want to tell you about skills.
We try to make good results, we lose ourselves, we lose ourselves, we get filled up in some coaching class in Vacation, we are worried about supervision.
Sometimes we get scared, our younger generation isn't getting robots.
A little emphasis can be laid on improving skills.
Far from technology, we can try to spend time with ourselves - someone has learnt the musical instruments - Tamil, Telugu, English, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi - anybody will find friends around us if we look at them.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw a picture, it may not be a good picture, but you can try to draw something on the paper.
Do you ever want to learn how to drive a auto-rickshaw
You see, these new experiments, their skills will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the staggering rhythm of life.
Get out of the past, do something, guys.
It's a chance to make life.
You're supposed to finish all the exams, we'll learn when we're in a new career, but we won't get a chance.
Again, you're gonna get into trouble, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn your magic, then at least learn the magic of Tas.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something you don't know, you're gonna be useful.
The human virtues within you will be awakened, so many steps will be made to improve.
I am telling myself that we cannot imagine how much we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
However, before going there, if we try to see the traditions of that place, if we go there, if we go there, if we go there, if we talk about it, if we ask them then we can enjoy seeing that place more.
Stay in the same place for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three to four days.
You can learn more than that.
Where did you go
Share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the government of India has also given you a very good opportunity.
New generations are almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They started believing in digital currency.
But if you refer to someone else or concentrate on someone else and the new person does the transaction thrice, you earn tens of rupees for doing this.
Ten rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get 20 people in a day, it'll be 200 rupees from the morning.
Businessmen can also earn income, students can also earn income.
This scheme is scheduled to be completed on 14th October. This will be your responsibility for creating a Digital India.
Now the red light is gone, so no one can say that the red light in the mind might have gone out.
I wanted an interesting phone call.
The phone also expressed apprehensions, but the phone shows that people did not like it at all, they used to feel a distance.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am talking about Shiva Chaube from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the government's Red Bacon Light Ban.
I don't have to get trapped in traffic jams, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I want to thank you very much for this ideal.
Thanks for the cleaning of the grandparents of PPs.
It is a part of the governments system to liquidate cars.
But we must strive to get rid of this idea from our minds.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that our history, our culture, our heritage must be remembered again and again.
With this, we can save our energy, get inspiration.
This year we are celebrating thousands of years of Sant Ramanujacharya.
Centuries are considered sufficient in other countries of the world, but India is one of the oldest countries that we have a chance to remember thousands of years or more.
Thousands of years ago, he carried out a movement with the entrance to their temples and succeeded.
We are so fortunate that we have been born in some great country to break social evils in all ages.
We can inspire him to reflect upon the spirit of a collective endeavour towards social integration while observing the millennium of Santaramunacharya.
Tomorrow, the Government of India is publishing a Postage Stamp in the memory of Saint.
I salute the Santaramnajacharya and pay my homage.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the 1st of May.
In some places around the world, this day is celebrated as Labour Day.
And when we talk of Labour Day, when we talk of Labour and Labour, we will remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people knew that we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the benefits and honour that the workers have received today.
Babasaheb's role in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramnujacharya, I also remember the great saint and socialist Jagatguru Basweshwar of Karnataka in the twelfth century.
In the twelfth century, he talked about labour and labour in the Kannada language.
In the Kannada language, he used to say Kai Kai Kai Kailas.
This means that through hard work you can reach Alokaila of Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember the post-damaged Thangadi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
All the Buddhist religious leaders of the world celebrate that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a symbol of great Ashoka's life.
It is especially applicable to our neighbouring countries.
May the neighbouring countries continue to collaborate and develop.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on May 5th.
The benefits from this satellite will help in the economic and other developmental sectors of South Asian countries.
These will include mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education, IT connectivity, and people-to-people contacts, which will help our entire space progress.
A valuable gift from India to further deepen our engagement with the entire South Asia is a reflection of our commitment to South Asia.
My best wishes to all the countries in South Asia who are involved in this South Asian Satellite project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
Those who have finished their exams have a little comfortable environment and all those families who are still undergoing exams.
But at a time when I would like to say that the last time I had told the students about Mann Ki Baat, listen to them again.
Those words will definitely be useful when you're tested.
Today is 26th March.
Independence Day of Bangladesh on 26 March 2019
Historical fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to all the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh for their freedom.
And I wish the people of Bangladesh that be it development or development of Bangladesh, I will assure them that India will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region by joining hands with a strong partner and a good friend of Bangladesh.
We are all proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are the heritage of our two countries.
The National Music of Bangladesh is also composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One of the most attractive information about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person to be honored with the Nobel Prize in Asia but also the name of the Nighthood by the British.
And when the British massacred at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who had fought against it and at that time when a twelve year old child had a deep impact on it.
The brutal killings of Jallianwala Bagh brought a new orientation to the lives of a laughing-in-house boy.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagwad was our beloved, inspired by all of us - Martyrs Bhagat Singh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his associates Sukhdev and Rajguru on the gallows. And we all know that on 23rd March there was no fear of satisfaction in the service of Mother India in the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were sacrificed for the liberation of Mother India.
And those three heroes are still our inspiration.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young men.
They're imprisoned, they're fine on the day of the gallows, but what they can do was worry about the British.
And so, on March 24, where the hanging was to be held, it was hanged on the 23rd.
It's a hiding thing that can't be seen normally.
And then the British brought their bodies to Punjab today and burned them quietly.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt the vibration of that land.
And I would certainly tell the youth of the country that whenever they get a chance to go to Punjab, they must visit the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagwan Singh and Batukeshwar Dattatreya.
It was during this period that the intensity of freedom, its intensity, its frenzy grew.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the armed revolution of the youth.
On the other hand, exactly 100 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Satyagraha in Champaran on April 10, 1917.
This year marks the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in India's freedom struggle, Gandhiji's vision and Gandhian style were seen in Champaran.
In the entire freedom movement, there was a paradigm shift, especially from the perspective of the United Nations.
The same event, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Satyagraha of Khara Satyagraha, the hustle-bustle of the workers of the factory in Ahmedabad and all of them had a profound impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and working style.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha with the pictures of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a people who came back to Hindustan in 1915 and worked for only two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was the one where Mahatma Gandhi's organisational strategy, the power to know the pulse of the Indian society, the power to know the characters of Mahatma Gandhi, the evil of the British administration through the conduct of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to create, inspire and bring the individuals of illiterate people to the field of fighting.
Therefore, we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha is Gandhi's word, it is a matter of deep study for any person to enter the realm of public life.
We can learn from him how to participate in public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And there was a time when the great leaders, whom we heard, Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Hon, had sent everyone to the village.
Prisoning on one side and putting yourself in constructive work.
There was a unique balance between Gandhi's work style.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be the meaning of disadvantage, what can be the meaning of disadvantage in front of such a large empire - not just by words, but by successful presentations, Gandhi had presented a whole new system.
The unflinching efforts of the nation and the society by nurturing the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' will fulfil the dreams of all those great men who have sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom.
And in this 21st century there are such Indians who do not want to change who do not want to participate in the progress of the country.
25 billion Indians will share a new India-New India with this desire of progress.
There are many people who regularly go to the hospital to serve the patients.
Our country, the spirit of Ratan Garbha and the service of the people, was born.
If we look at this thinking together, we can understand how powerful it is.
In the context of India, it is very natural and urgent that different views and views will emerge.
However, it is also true that if the entire country takes steps to make a solemn pledge and implement it then the dream of a New India can be successful.
It is not necessary that all the work should be done in the budget or government expenditure.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge, follows the traffic rules, performs his duties with dedication and stops the use of petrol-diesel at least one day a week, then we will be able to take this small step in a new direction.
And I would like to say that everybody should observe their civilizational rituals and perform their duties.
This could be the beginning of New India.
India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
I urge you to come forward to dedicate your lives and make a solemn pledge and participate in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude to you all.
BHIM App has been started two and a half months ago, but about one and a half crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot imagine that in this way you can become a major partner of the country, you can dedicate yourself to a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, the Digidhan Mela was organized for public education and awareness.
Nearly 1. 25 lakh people have received specific awards for the beneficiaries and seventy thousand people have received specific awards for the businessmen.
Let us join in this effort to reduce cash transactions and use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever I ask your advice for Mann Ki Baat, there are many opinions.
But I have noticed that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think it's important to understand the importance of cleanliness to the common people.
I pass through a river every day, where people throw away a lot of waste and pollut the river.
This river is flowing through the Rispona bridge and our house is lying beside us .
In order to keep this river clean, I went to Paradise and talked to the people, spoke to them, but there was no special benefit.
I urge you to send a team here or publish it through a newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, please see how a girl from the 11th century is suffering.
He's so angry at the dirty dump in the river.
I think it's a good sign.
I want 125 crore countrymen to be angry with garbage.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction and anger, we will certainly be able to do something against garbage.
It is a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, has advised me and at the same time he has said that he has tried his best but failed.
Since the movement of Swachhata has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone has been associated with it in a positive way.
It's a movement.
Hate to waste is growing gradually.
Be it awareness or active participation or be it movement or be it a movement, it has its own importance.
This movement is possible in a comprehensive manner.
It's hard to do, but we have to do it.
I believe that the consciousness among the youth of the country, among the children, among the students, among the youth is indicative of a good outcome.
Today, those who listen to Gayatri in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell all those countrymen that the words of Gayatri were spoken by all of us.
I don't get half as much as I can, and I'm leaving it there.
You've ever seen how much we waste the irregular food we dumped.
Have you ever imagined that if you don't waste, then how many poor people can feed this food.
There's nothing different about this.
Normally in our house when mother provides food to small kids , then say that take as much as you can eat .
There must be some effort in this regard, but in spite of this, depression is a reflection of social inequality.
It's unfair to the poor.
Secondly, if the savings are done then the family will also get financial benefits.
Though it is a good idea for the society , but it is such a thing that it will benefit the family as well .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want awareness to grow.
I know some youngsters who are associated with such movements.
The youngsters of our country do such hard work.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
That's the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate a little empty , keep the stomach a little empty .
When we came to the point of view of health we said that on 7th April ' World Health Day ' .
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
This time, the United Nations focused on depression on World Health Day on 7th April.
According to a message, more than 150 million people worldwide are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many people around us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand that, and maybe we can feel embarrassed to talk about it openly.
I would like to tell my countrymen that depression is not such a thing that we cannot get rid of it.
When he created a psychological setup, he began to reconcile himself.
The first thing is that we need to express the depression without suppressing it.
With your friends, with your parents, brothers and sisters, tell the teachers what is happening inside you.
Do you ever think that man is doing this
You must be sure these are the first symptoms of depression.
If you want to keep yourself away from the middle of all, take care of him.
Leave those whom he likes to stay with.
Please inspire him to speak openly in the funny words, find out what is hidden in his heart.
In diseases like diabetes people become physically weak , depression reduces the consciousness of people , gains courage , reduces the strength of fighting in lifestyle , destroys all our life-force .
Your confidence will come back if you start solving other problems with the spirit of service.
If you are able to meet yourself with others, serve yourself and do it selflessly, you will see if your mind is lightened.
Yoga is a habit but it is a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is a very useful medium for freedom from sorrow, freedom from obstacles and happiness.
International Day of Yoga was celebrated on 21st June every year.
If you have a few suggestions on the theme of International Yoga Day, send me the ideas and guidance through my mobile app.
Keep writing all the poems, songs, so that there can be an inspiration among the common people.
This time I will talk to my mothers and sisters about healthcare.
A few days back, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The maternity leave that was given during pregnancy, pregnancy and post-natal childbirth was 12 weeks before.
Only two-three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, the country will be rich.
New Year Festival is celebrated in different parts of our country.
In Maharashtra, the festival of New Year is celebrated on the occasion of Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Ayodh, Sambastra Puja, Judh Sheetal in Bihar's Mithila and Satwani in Magadh.
A large country is full of diversity in India.
Greetings to all of you on New Year
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The chirping of the bird brings a tide of joy.
Not only flowers, but fruits also brighten on the branches of trees.
Summer fruits can also be seen in the spring.
In the same way, yellow flowers of mustard are grown in the field of cultivation.
Palash's red flower gives a signal of Holly's arrival.
My Khasru has given a very beautiful description of this season of climate change.
He wrote: The woods are bursting, the jungle is bursting, the fucking Kokil is calling, uh-uh.
When the colour of happiness in nature, when it touches joy in the form of reverence, people also enjoy it.
Spring Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals make the lives of people colorful.
And so he said I'd like to say something about 104 satellite launches and interceptor missiles.
Shobha ji thank you very much for remembering the pride of India.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting ourselves from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge or information, technology and science have proved their role.
15 February 2017 is a glorious day in the national life of India.
Our scientists have raised our heads to the world.
And we know that within a few years, ISRO has successfully completed a few unprecedented projects.
ISRO has established a worldwide roadmap for space expeditions following the success of the Mars Mission, Mangalaya on Mars.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also heartening to note that this is the 38th success of PSLV.
This is not just a historic achievement for the entire India.
ISROs cost effective space programme has been a wonder for the world and hence the whole world appreciates the success of Indian scientists in an open mind.
My farmer brothers and sisters will be able to know about how much water is available in our country, how it should be used, what should be taken care of. Our new satellite cartosat-2D will be of great help.
He sent some pictures to our satellite room.
It started his own work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our youngsters, our women scientists, have led all these campaigns.
This extraordinary cooperation between the youth and women is a privilege for the success of ISRO.
I commend the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the people of the country.
They have always kept the aim of experimenting with space sciences for the common man and for the service of the nation and are creating new achievements every day.
The more we appreciate these scientists and their entire team, the less it will be.
Sobhaji asked another question about India's security.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor missile in defence.
In Interception Technologies, the television missile captured about one hundred kilometers of Uprashetra missiles from the ground while flying its experimental flights.
This is a significant achievement in defence.
When I see new technologies, when I see new scientific achievements then I am happy.
And asking has played a very important role in the development of human life.
And the intelligent one who does not let him ask for a question, he doesn't ask for a question, he doesn't ask for a new question.
That's the reason for a new discovery.
They don't calm down until the answer is answered.
And if we look at the stream of human life for thousands of years then we can say that there is no obstacle in the stream of this development of human life.
It's impossible.
Efforts to make the universe, the laws of creation, the minds of the people are constantly going on.
New science and new technologies emerge from among them.
And every technology, every new form of science gives a new generation.
My dear young friends, when we talk about science, the hard work of the artists, I remember that once again I have said that the younger generation should be attracted to science.
There is a need for many scientists in the country.
Todays scientists will launch a sustainable transformation in the life of the next generation.
When science researches, innovations, innovations and innovations in the minds of the common man, then science becomes the hallmark of the common man.
This is where I have seen an innovation for our poor fishermen.
All such innovations have been achieved from this competition.
Different services are also being technologically intensified.
Technology has become an integral part of life.
Indias digital transaction rate is rising.
In particular, the youth are eliminating digital payments from their mobile phones.
I think it's a good sign.
The Lucky Grahak Yojana and the DG Dhan Barak Yojana have been responsive.
It has been almost two months since these two schemes, 15,000 people are getting prizes per day.
A lot of people have received 1 lakh prizes under this scheme.
More than four thousand businessmen have earned 50,000 rupees.
The Minister expressed happiness at the Narendra Modi-App that he has received Rs. 1000 in the Loki Grahak Yojana.
And then I believe that Santosh should share what he wrote with you.
I am very happy to know this - Santosh ji, your name and work have given us a lot of pleasure.
On the one hand, he has become an Ambassador of the Locky Grahak Yojana.
Travelers are also being motivated to create awareness about digital systems and inspire many more to participate in the digital system.
He had interacted with his friends about how the use of cards, e-wallets in the form of a familiar family in a young friend Puja Nemadh from Maharashtra and how they were happy about it.
He is also encouraging others to take up a mission of Rs. 1 lakh prize.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money in a way.
A memorable day.
A few days ago, the 125th anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar passed away.
Remembering him, you also teach at least 125 people to update BHIM.
Teach how to deal with it.
Therefore, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The BHIM App has to be delivered to 125 crore people by visiting the house.
The movement that has been going on for the past two-three months has been accomplished in several villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture contributes a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
Today, I would like to share a joy with you.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked very hard to provide food grains.
The hard work of our farmers has resulted in the highest production of paddy this year.
All the information indicates that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This year, the kind of crops that have grown in the fields, it seems that every day we celebrate the festival of Pongal or Vaishakhi.
This year, more than 2,700 million tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
Our farmers have written more than eight percent of the latest records.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of the country have heard about the poor and about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land have produced various pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of the country by the farmers.
I am extremely grateful to my farmer brothers and sisters for their hard work and for the fact that they have produced a record amount of pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some programmes are being run by the government, by the society, by the organizations and by the organizations for cleanliness.
Sometimes, there is a sense of consciousness towards cleanliness.
In Waranga, the state of Telangana, only closed houses have been seminared with the importance of direct sanitation.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized on 17th and 18th February in Hyderabad.
Six household toilet pits have been cleaned and officials themselves have shown how to re-use the Twin Pit Toilet holes.
They also demonstrated that the toilets of these new methods are so convenient and there is no other problem or narrow mental obstacles until they are cleaned.
We also do the work of cleaning small houses like toilets.
A Standard Twin PitToilet for a six-member family is filled in about five-four years.
Our farmers are well-known with the NPK.
Different government departments and differently observed Swachhta Pakhwada.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development as well as the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhata Abhiyan.
For the second half of March, two more Ministries will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan (Swachhta Abhiyan) and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does a significant job then the entire country gets a new strength and confidence increases.
We have welcomed the kind of performance that our Divyang players have made in the Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T20 World Cup Final this month, India has emerged as the World Champion for the second time in a series of defeats in Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all the players of this team.
The country is proud of the success of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that Divyang brothers and sisters are supportive, strong, courageous and unwavering in their resolve.
We can always learn something new from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, our daughters are not lagging behind.
They have moved on their feet and are making the country proud with their success.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won silver medals in ASEAN Ragabisevens Trophy.
I convey my best wishes to all these players.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a fast pace.
This is not just a government scheme, it is now a campaign for social consciousness and people's education.
Over the last two years, people have also joined this scheme.
The burning sensation from every corner of the country makes the common man think and for years, there has been a change in the mindset of the old system.
It is really a pleasure to know that the festival has been celebrated on the occasion of the birth anniversary of daughters.
Such positive thinking towards daughters is a way of social recognition.
I came to know that the Cuddalore district of the state of Tamil Nadu has been able to stop child marriage by conducting a special campaign.
More than 175 marriages have been closed so far.
More than 55-60,000 bank accounts have been opened in the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
Under the Har Ghar Dastak scheme in Madhya Pradesh, every village has been running a campaign to educate the daughters in every household.
Your child Apna Vidyalaya campaign is aimed at encouraging those who leave school without finishing their education to re-school their education.
New imaginations have also been linked to it.
It has been changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with it.
I can ask you a lot.
What is happening in the world, the thoughts of the poor people of the village are coming to me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors decorated our climate, economic structure and social systems in such a way that there is no relaxation in social life in any case.
In the last few days, we have celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Shri Krishna is a person who, even after so many thousands of years, creates innovation, inspiration, innovation and innovative energy in every festival.
He can be an example and inspiration to solve any problem even today.
Any person can find solutions to any existing problem from the life of Sri Krishna.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, Sarathy could also be convinced to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes climbing the mountains sometimes wear a brick of food so that we feel innovative about everything.
Today, when I talk to you people, my heart is moving towards both the directions.
A handsome miracle Mohan, another charming joke.
Sudarshan Chakravarth Mohan left the bank of Yamuna and ventured into Dwarka on the seashore of Gujarat and spent his last days in Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna born on the seashore.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakraborty Mohan had used his intellect, duties, courage and thinking to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October, 1869, a person was born on the seashore of Porbandar, who guided human history to a new path, established new excellence.
He served the Mazdoor of Mills, who were not eligible for deserving labour.
He considered the service of the poor, the helpless, the hungry and the hungry as one of his duties.
He himself used to serve leprosy-affected persons so that others get inspired to prove falsehoods about leprosy.
Mahatma Gandhi used to run away to help anyone who was in danger.
He did not just emphasize the importance of service, he also knew the importance of self-reliance in service.
If the word 'Seva' is enjoyed only then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But at the same time, the real pleasure is that this idea is also inherent in service matters.
We can easily understand this by observing Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and societies, humanity and humanity were the only thoughts.
Whether it is the Phoenix Farm of Africa, the Tolstoy Farm, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he emphasized the importance of community development in a fundamental way.
I have got the opportunity to pay my homage to the supreme privilege of my life at various workplaces of Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhiji emphasized the spirit of service as well as the strength of the organization.
We want to use both social and social integration, community service and community mobilization in useful lives.
Will you come and leave E-will we accept
There is no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, if he works in a spirit of self-dedication, he will have a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dundi in Gujarat.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a good news on this occasion.
The Haripura panels were specially fascinating.
You remember that there was a Congress session in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in the history of the election to the President of India.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura session of 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then President of Santiniketan Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibit it during the Art Work Session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artwork enhances our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
This practice of his art has given immortality to the Constitution as well as to Nandlal Bose.
Nandlal Bose inspected the villages around Haripura and then constructed someart canvas about rural India.
This precious artwork was discussed in Venice.
And once again with the congratulations of Gandhiji for 150 years, I appeal to every Indian to make a solemn pledge.
There is a need to do something for the country, for the society, for the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true reverence to Bapu.
Friends of Mother India, you must remember that for the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign in the country for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from September 11.
This time we're gonna need special emphasis on plastic.
There is a lot of enthusiasm among all sections of the society about this campaign.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have planted placards in a storehouse where it has been written that the buyer should take it with his own bag.
You can also show your partnership in saving money and protecting the environment.
On 2nd October, when Bapu will complete 150 years of his life, I will not only dedicate him to the open defecation free India but also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic.
I would like to appeal to all the communities, every village, every village, every village and every citizen of the city, to pray for the Gandhi Jayanti of this year in a way that our Mother India should be freed from plastic waste.
On 2nd October as a special day.
It could be recycled.
It can be used as a fuel.
There is no need to see here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspirational.
My dear countrymen, our culture is well-defined, a gem of knowledge.
Today, I would like to touch upon an important issue by a Sanskrit Subhashit, which has been written a long time ago, but it still has great significance.
Fools call stones gems.
Our culture has a lot of majesty in Anna.
We have also transformed the knowledge of food grains into science.
We all need nutritious and nutritious food, especially for women and innovative children.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and entertaining ways.
The Anganwadi workers used to collect one handful of corn from everyone on the day of their harvest.
These food grains were used to produce hot food for children and women.
The people who donate this have become a conscious citizen and a social worker.
Thereafter, he dedicated himself to this cause and in this movement he became a soldier.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, it was thought in 2010 that the child should be given complementary food in the Annaprashan programme to create awareness among the people.
It is a great initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states, people observe the 'Tithi Bhojan' campaign.
If a family has a birthday, a happy day, a memorable day, then the family members go to Anganwadi and school by preparing tasty, nutritious food and the family members themselves feed the children, share their happiness and enjoy the happiness.
This is a unique combination of service and joy.
Friends, there are several small issues that can help our country fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected the families of both the poor and the rich.
Poshan Abhiyan will be observed throughout the country in September.
You must join this campaign, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can save one or two people from malnutrition, our country will also be protected from malnutrition.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that a lot of questions would be raised about this issue and that is why it happened.
Over the last few weeks, wherever I have gone and whoever I have met, there has been a Man Vs Wild issue.
Through this episode, I have not only been able to connect with the youth of India but also with the youth of all over the world, I have never been able to imagine that such a place will be created in the minds of the youngsters.
I have never imagined how diverse things our country and the youth of the world are looking at.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I felt.
Tiger, Lion, Organism, I wonder what kind of things people can inspire.
I firmly believe that now people are asking about the steps taken in the field of climate justice in India.
Is it edited later
Look, there's no secret.
Some people have questions about this, so I unveil this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to listen in English, that's why the conversation became very simple and this is the complication of technology.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must visit nature and wildlife contagiously.
I told you before, I repeat, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will expand.
On 15th August, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had requested all of you to visit 15 places in India and 15 places for 100 percent tourism in the next three years.
Your life will spread your thoughts.
Last month we had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census.
Do you know the number of tigers in India
India has 2967 tigers.
A few years ago, half of it would have been painful.
Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 on tigers.
A resolution was taken here expressing concern over the reduction in tiger population in the world.
The resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is New India, where we have achieved the goal at a rapid pace.
We have doubled our number of tigers by 2019.
In India, not only the number of tigers, but also the number of protected areas and community reserves has increased.
I also remember the lions of the Gir Forest in Gujarat when I was publishing the Tiger Martyrdom.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's residence in the jungle of Gir was shrinking.
Their numbers were declining.
We've done a lot of entrepreneurship in Gir.
I decided to appoint a female guard there in 2007.
Infrastructure facilitates improvement in tourism industry.
In terms of nature and wildlife, we focus only on conservation.
Now we have to think about compassion and sympathy in the direction of conservation.
My dear countrymen, can anyone forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September 1893
This young Indian monk was awakened by the radiation speech of the entire world among mankind.
In 1893, when the supreme India was on the threshold of the world, the world was compassionate, the world was compelled to invent a new India in the brilliant words of the great Swami Vivekananda.
Come, let us build the India that Swami Vivekananda had seen, the power that he knew.
On this occasion, we are launching Fit India Movement across the country.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be a very attractive mission for the foolish and the old.
But today I am not in detail in this regard.
Wait for August 29th.
Further, on 2nd October, for a totally dedicated plastic.
With all our strengths, we will join the campaign to keep our houses and its surroundings plastic-free.
I believe that this mission will create an uproar in social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
I'm waiting for your message and advice.
May the spirit of joy and service be illuminated.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January, 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a sense of reform that brings the next generation to be aware of democracy and the responsibility of democracy.
However, there should not be much debate on the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens in our country, the deeper the lack of sympathy, the widespread practices that should be done.
I hope that at every level, every moment, the more emphasis is laid on the right, the more it must be laid.
India's democracy can move on both the paths of right and duty.
Tomorrow, 30th January, we will have the holy rituals of the revered Bapu.
On 30th January, at 11 a.m., we observe a two minute silence and pay our homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country.
As a united society, as a nation, we should become a common habit in the celebration of a two-minute commemoration at 11th January, 2019.
On the eve of Democracy Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
All these awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Jinnah Seva Medal.
I especially urge the youngsters to work on social media. Can you do something
This time, the people who have been honored with this honor, search for internet and appreciate them and send them to their friends.
When we get to know about their courage, courage and heroism in detail, we get astonished as well as inspired.
On the one hand, when all of us were happy with the news of the month of January 26th and the month of January, our soldiers in Kashmir who laid down their lives due to the defence of the country, due to the defence of the snow.
I pay my homage and respect to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware of the fact that I am continuously listening to Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March, April, 2018 is the month of examination in every household.
Half or two children are tested in the world but the entire family is suffocated by the pressure of examination.
Family anxiety, student anxiety, teacher anxiety - a variety of fascinating atmosphere is seen everywhere in the world.
And I have always been convinced that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to young friends in detail in detail.
When I announced this thing, a lot of teachers, teachers, students sent me a message, sent questions, advised, written about pain, reflected anxiety and after seeing all these things, I would like to share with you today.
I sent a message on the telephone from creation.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but you must have the same question in your mind.
The test must be a pleasure.
We have worked hard all year, this time we have got the opportunity to inform, this should be a festival of hope and enthusiasm.
You're gonna have to decide that you're gonna think of it pressure, not pleasure.
And when the festival takes place, the best of us comes out.
At the time of the festival, society gets its own strength.
During the exams, there should be an atmosphere of festivities in the family, among friends.
The entire family, like a team, should fulfil the role of oneself with zeal and zeal to make this festival a success.
The truth is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal, these three-four months are just tests and tests.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, by following the tradition of self-interest, by understanding the family environment of oneself, make it a festival.
And so I'll tell you, "smile more sorry more".
And you have seen that when you're happy, you're laughing, you're relaxed.
You remember the whole scene of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see the exams in the right direction.
I think that's a question of life and death.
The exam means the evaluation of what you've done for years.
J.
Brilliant examples of darkness.
He wanted to join the Air Force but was ungrateful.
If he had become disappointed after this failure, he would have lost his life, would India have got such a big scientist
This has not only increased the competition among children but also increased the anxiety.
I would like to share your views on the current situation and the future of education.
What you really have in life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and determination.
You don't think he's a good doctor, so you need to go to him.
When you go to a nominee for a major case, do you look for his marksheet
You have seen his experience, his wisdom and success.
That is why sometimes the burden of this number becomes our way forward.
You will be surprised to know that whenever you run for numbers only then you have found the easiest way and focused on certain things, but you are disappearing when there is a problem outside this pool.
And that is why sometimes it happens that despite being extremely grateful in the examination, we face failure in life.
Richa has raised one more topic, this is competition.
It's a very big psychological battle.
We can give examples of Sachin Tendulkar in this regard.
Friends, in every sphere of life and especially when you are going to examine, look, if you had given two hours to take care of yourself, have you done it for three hours
When you thought of getting up earlier, it was too late, can you get up in the right time
Shri S.
That's how he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the examination of the tenth grade, but if she didn't get help, I couldn't pass the CBSE exam.
Nice-yes, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women who ask me questions and advise me is higher.
If you learn to admit once, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't admit this, you're gonna get rid of this problem.
Hope makes the road tough.
Acknowledgement of the present situation creates an opportunity to open a new path of solution.
So admit what you have.
Look, you'll be free of weight.
We discuss the weight of school bags for small children, but sometimes I think that parents expect more than school bags for aspirational children.
Many years ago, a familiar person was in the hospital due to heart attack.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about illness.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we live in a similar way with the younger ones.
Have you ever thought of giving a glimpse of laughter to the children during the exams
You'll see the situation changes.
I have a very funny call.
The gentleman didn't want to mention his name.
If you hear the details of the phone, you will understand why the person doesn't want to publish his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I had done such a thing in my childhood that I am not going to mention my name.
I tried to fake once when I was a kid.
I wasted a lot of time thinking about how to imitate, what to do with it.
At that time I could get the same number if I had to spend for studying.
When I tried to duplicate myself, I was caught and there was a problem with my friends around me.
I'll tell you the same story again.
So where will you reach
Think you're digging your own street holes, creating obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and creative powers to imitate them.
If I talk about sports during the exams, everyone will say: What kind of Prime Minister is this
It is because the common man thinks that if the students think about sports, they will be ignorant of their studies.
Besides the brain there should be proper activity of the rest of the body .
If you have a brake for five minutes, you'll feel more concentrated than you read.
I don't know if everyone likes it, but I'm talking about my faith.
Once a folk lyricist came to meet me.
How long did he ask me to sleep
I wanted to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, "No, you don't tell me, it's related to your throat to give me this statement.
If you sleep well, your morning cord will rest too.
I didn't think of my sleep and throat before.
He gave me a simple trick.
Don't do that, you'll be dissatisfied with your feelings.
Otherwise, the day the marksheet comes, the guardians will be able to see my replica instead of you.
If you sleep, it will work. Don't think about it once.
Sports play a very important role in keeping the mind, mind and body functional.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the 1st of February this year marks forty years of Indian Coast Guard.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for performing their duty towards the nation.
Our Coast Guard has taken pride in the top four Coast Guards in the world with 126 indigenously built warships and 62 aircraft.
Keeping in mind the commitment of the Ministry of Coast Guard, Our Coast Guard has always been committed to protecting the maritime boundaries of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard team had planned to keep our beach clean with the mainstream of the Coast Guard and thousands of civilians were also involved in it.
The Coast Guard has our female pilot officer, while they are capable of handling the cannons of the Hovercraft.
Spring Rituraj.
Saraswati is worshipped in Spring-Panchami.
For the worship of learning, worship is done.
Not only scholarship, but also a festival of inspiration for valour.
Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration for me.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of this spring-five festival.
My dear countrymen, the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme has been accomplished by AIR.
Immediately after addressing my Mann Ki Baat last month, I have started listening to Mann Ki Baat in regional languages.
This effort has been a major success.
The countrymen have written letters from far and wide.
I convey my best wishes to them for this self-inspired effort of AIR.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to all of you on Christmas.
Today is a day to realise service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus Christ said, It is not good for the poor, it is our recognition for them.
There's a story about this.
Lord Jesus stood by a Temple Treasure.
Many rich people came and donated a lot of money.
Only then came a poor widow and donated two copper pieces.
On the one hand, two copper coins don't carry any money.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malviji, Malviji, who had awakened the resolve and confidence of the people of India, had given a new dimension to the modern education system.
On his birth anniversary, I pay my homage to Bhav.
Just a couple of days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Banaras, the holy land of Malviji.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahammati Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
A cancer centre is being set up for the entire region, not only in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh but also in the beneficiaries of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Bharat Ratna, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, our country has also raised its head in terms of atomic energy.
Atal ji has established an ideal in every role of leader, parliamentarian, minister or prime minister.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his health.
I am fortunate to have worked with Atal ji as an employee.
Pictures of many memories are moving in front of the eye.
When I visited this morning, I shared an old video of Atal ji's affection for a small worker.
Today, as a gift of a big day, all the countrymen are going to benefit from the two schemes.
Everyone wants to understand and learn each other.
In order to encourage this, the Government of India is launching a scheme to encourage customers and small businesses to make e-payments a habit of increasing the strength of mobile banking.
The scheme for incentivizing consumers is the "Lucky Grahak Yojana" and "DG-Dhan Parma Yojana".
And on 25th December, as a gift from Christmas, a dr will be deposited in the accounts of 15,000 people.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 people will receive this award every day.
Millions of families will receive a gift of Rs. Crore in 100 days but those who will be eligible for this gift are mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI.
Use all digital transactions like USSD etc.
The DG-DhanBapar Yojana is for businessmen.
Businessmen will join this scheme as well as integrate their businesses into cashless.
Businessmen will also be given different prizes and the number of prizes will be thousands.
These awards will not be available for those who can buy more than Rs. 3000.
With the help of USSD, the poorest of the poor can avail the benefits of Feature Phones and General Phones, and they will get the benefits of this scheme.
People from rural areas will be able to win the award through AEPS.
Your ten-twelve-class child will also be able to teach you this method properly.
This is very simple - it is easy to send a hotspot from a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to encourage this process.
Businessmen can easily guess how big this decision is.
Those traders who exchange digital payments will be exempted from income tax to online payment methods instead of cash in their businesses.
I have learnt that the Assam Government has announced a 10 discount on payment of Property Tax and Trade License Fee digitally.
The branches of Rural Banks have decided that their 75 subscribers will be awarded Rs. 50,000 by way of two digital transactions from January to March.
As on 31st March, 2017, if a village has achieved 100 digital transactions, the Government has announced a grant of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transaction scheme.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give Rs. 5000 prizes to the first 10 farmers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme who will be fully pursued digitally for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the States who have taken such initiatives.
Interestingly, GNFC's fertilizer sales have increased by 27 over the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, there is a need for an unorganized sector in our daily lives.
In most cases, the wages of all these people are paid in cash or money for work, and we know that workers are deprived of it.
80 instead of Rs. 100, when Rs. 80 is to be paid, Rs. 50 is to be paid and these workers are deprived of several other benefits including health insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is directly deposited in the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
Countries like India should come forward in this regard.
Our youngsters have made great strides through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity. Our younger generation should take new ideas, new technologies, new technologies and take new initiatives in this field.
We have to join the nation with full force in the mission to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I appeal to the people before every Mann Ki Baat programme, send your suggestions, give your opinions and this time thousands of opinions have been suggested in Mygov and Narendra Modi App.
The writers of the second tribe who have laid emphasis on these things have given a detailed account of the work for the betterment of the country, the work for the betterment of the country, the work for the betterment of the country, however, what kind of fraud is being committed against it, how new methods are being adopted.
Shriman Gurumani Keubal has written in MyGov, which deserves to be acclaimed for black money.
As citizens, we are rightly in trouble, but we are happy that we are cooperating with the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in the fight against corruption, black money etc.
The same feeling has emerged from all parts of the country.
We all feel it.
In fact, this is the fulfilment of change in the Agent of Change.
I would like to thank all of you for one more reason, not only for the sufferings they have suffered, but also for the people who are trying to distract the people.
Not only this, some people have opened the masks of those rumours with their intellect, strength and creativity.
I salute this power of the people for centuries.
People's devotion is God's blessings, people's blessings.
I thank the people of our country for taking part in this great struggle against corruption and black money.
I wanted that there should be detailed discussions on corruption and black money as well as political parties and political funding in the Parliament.
Those who are keeping a lot of political parties are wrong.
This government is a people's government.
On the other hand, I had said on the first day - 8th, this is a wonderful fight.
There is a lot of news coming from the government system from the citizens.
The success that we have achieved is mainly because of the awareness of the people.
Can anyone imagine what kind of risk is being taken by the conscious citizens of our country to open their masks
If you get help, this fight will be very simple.
There is a third group among those who send me letters, a large number of people.
They say that Modiji will not stop, you will not get tired, you should take as much steps as you can.
We have to win this war, we don't get tired.
We have brought it out and we have strictly enacted the Benami Property Act.
This law will play his role in the coming days.
It is our primary duty to work for patriotism and public interest.
In the last few years, India has gained pride in the global economy.
As per the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached third place in the Top Prospective Host Economys 2016-18.
India has improved 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Similarly, the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2016 highlighted India's 19-phase progress.
Similarly, several other reports also indicate Indias rapid progress.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of the Parliament has created warmth among the countrymen.
They were angry at the activities of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their fervour in this regard.
But sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes something good happens, the mind fills itself with joy.
In the House of Parliament, there has been a good work that the people of the country have not noticed.
Brothers and sisters, I am glad to say this thing today that a bill related to the goals of Divyangjans has been passed by the Parliament.
Our government is committed to persons with disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to this effort when they won four medals at Para Olympics.
This victory has not only enhanced the dignity of the country, its strength has surprised the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, our Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable resources and strengths.
I am happy to note that the passage of this Act will facilitate more jobs for Divyangjans.
Conservation limit has been increased to 4 per cent for government jobs.
The Act provides for the education, facilitation and grievances of persons with disabilities.
The government has enacted this new legislation in terms of public opinion.
Certain categories of persons with disabilities have been created so that for the first time they can get the right opportunity and justice.
Thalassemia, Perkinsons Disease Affected Persons and Dwarfs have also been included in this category.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there have been reports from the field of sports so that we all feel proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team won 4-0 against the UK.
The performance of some youngsters is very commendable.
The test test team didn't do a very good job, but led a good leadership.
I convey my best wishes to all of them.
Good news has been received in Hockey after 15 years.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters for their success.
This is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey team.
Our women sportspersons have also achieved great success last month.
The Indian women hockey team won the Asian Championships Trophy and a few days back, Indias women hockey team won the 18 Asia Cup.
I convey my sincere congratulations to all the cricketers and hockey players.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a new year of hope and zeal.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We have celebrated Diwali last month.
Like every year, during Diwali, I had gone to China border to wreath with the army.
I have celebrated the Deepawali festival in the high altitude of the Himalayas with the ITBP jawans.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepavali is totally different.
They were full of those emotions and not only did I see a wonderful response from the countrymen who have conveyed their best wishes to the soldiers with their own happiness.
When I was looking at these things, I was surprised to see what they were all imagined.
But, to be honest, we don't think that's the time for the festival of Deepavali.
On the contrary, I felt like joining the festival of Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the spirit, joy, love and joy that has been shared among the soldiers of our army will be confined only to Holi-Deepawali or not
I would like to appeal to you, come as a society, as a nation, as a part of nature and as a nation, whenever there is any festival or festival, we will remember the soldiers of our army in some way or the other.
When the nation becomes united with the Armed Forces, the strength of the Armed Forces will increase by 125 crores.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had met me.
He had come to attend the Panchayat Sammelan of Orajammu and Kashmir.
Approximately 40-50 chiefs came from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
For a long time we had a chance to talk.
While they came forward to make some claims for the development and development of the village, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the laws and the future of the children came up.
A few days back, the boards in Kashmir were accumulated and about 95 of the students were in the examination.
I can clearly assume that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are committed to the development of a bright future through education.
I thank the students not only for their commitment but also their guardians, parents, teachers and top village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I have asked people to discuss Mann Ki Baat this time, I admit that everybody has made a single proposal.
Everybody wanted me to say something in detail with a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November at 8:00 pm, I had spoken of a great campaign for the nation for the proper development of my country.
Whenever I had taken this decision and had given you that decision, I had clearly stated that this is not a simple decision, it is a difficult step.
At the time of the announcement, I had warned that the effect of this proposal will be so difficult that it will take at least 50 days to get out of it and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
It is not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians are deeply respected and confident that they are committed to the development of the country.
This is why we will be successful, whether the bank and the post office staff are working in adversity.
And when it comes to humanity, they are becoming more active.
When the local bank employees lost their ears, they immediately reached the house of the elderly gentleman.
Not only this, he has arranged for treatment.
I'm surprised at this incident.
They are taking various legal measures to save their black money.
One request is not to play with the poor for fulfilling their unfair interests.
Your injustice to the poor is being rolled out in the records of the poor, not you, these poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
Strict rules have been framed to bring benamis under control, which are being implemented in all areas.
I am an ordinary citizen of District Harada, Tahshi and Village Tirali in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand note closures are extremely commendable.
My request is that through Mann Ki Baat, give a few such examples where the common people have welcomed this step for the betterment of the nation even after facing many difficulties.
Thank you very much, you said that the time is coming, but no one can think that you can take such a big step.
By closing the notes of five hundred and a thousand, you should have taught the corrupt black traders.
Every citizen of India doesn't have a bigger time than this.
That's why I thank you once more.
When I get to hear such news through media, public and government sources, the enthusiasm of work increases very much.
People went there and ate the bill when they returned after two-four-four-four days.
This is the strength of my country, which is the main strength of service and sacrifice.
The news that I had made during my election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world also learnt the use of the word 'Chair'.
But I didn't know that there could be a cha-batch in the boat
I got the news that there's a marriage to Surya on November 12.
In this marriage, the party had organised tea drinks only for the invitees, there was no food and snacks because they lacked cash due to the closure of the note.
They also supported this and set an example in the fight against corruption and black money by Bharat Maru and Skilled Parmar.
Whenever there is a crisis, people will find new ways and once again I get a chance to know about Dhekiajuli village in Assam on TV record.
Weekly wages are available to the village tea workers and these tea workers.
Four neighbouring women collectively bought and paid two thousand rupees.
You are very well aware that even a few days ago, the poorest of the poor could get the minimum wages deposited.
Only fifty percent of each municipality tax falls.
However, after the announcement on 8th, there was a hike in the old notebook.
It has been observed in the history of seventy-five cities that during the last year, Rs. 3,500 crore was deposited in taxes, you will be surprised to know that Rs.
We are getting such a plurality, which has the direct consequences.
Brothers and sisters, Villages and farmers are the backbone of our economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmer brothers of the country when we are adjusting every citizen even after facing a lot of difficulties due to this change in the economy.
I'm taking the account of this year's seeds.
I am glad to see that the number of sales in wheat, pulses or sesame seeds has increased as compared to last year.
In all adversities, the farmer brothers have taken a new path.
Some important decisions have been taken by the government, while priority is being given to the farmers and the villages.
Our country's six traders also generate employment and also participate in economic development.
I had taken a very important decision in the last year's budget and it was decided that small shopkeepers like the big Malls of the city will be able to do business for twenty-four hours.
Under the Mudra Yojana, a lot of effort has been taken to provide their loans.
Millions and crores of rupees have been given to these small traders through the Mudra scheme because innumerable people who are engaged in this small business have started the turnover of crores of rupees.
However, due to this decision, it is natural for all these small businesses to have a problem.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Provide POS Machine for Credit Card and learn how to do business without a note.
You have seen that big Malls continue to trade through technology.
Similarly, even a small businessman can do business with a little User-friendly technology.
There is no chance of any loss, there is a chance to grow.
I urge you to join the Cashless Society.
You can leverage the full banking facility on mobile phones for commercial promotion and continue the cashless transactions.
These are technological solutions that are safe, secure and fast.
I want you not only to help in the success of this mission, but also to give your leadership, I believe that you can lead this transformation.
I am confident that you can finish all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that a lot of research has been done on you.
It's written in the papers that a salary and what is being paid in the hands is different.
Sometimes it's full of labour, it appears that a man is standing outside, he has to be split and forced to absorb this absorption as a part of life.
In today's new system, we want your bank accounts, your remuneration money will be transferred to the bank so that the minimum wage conditions are changed.
Like you get the full money, no one takes it off.
Today, I specially want to talk to young friends.
We say that India is a country where 65 of the population is 25 years old.
You, the youngsters of my country, I know that my decisions have been approved by you people.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you will contribute a lot to taking this thing forward in a positive way.
But guys, you're my real soldier, real friend.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
You don't have any idea of the world today.
It may be that the elder brothers of your family don't know so much about Arma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mami.
You are aware of the kind of online banking and online ticket booking.
It's a very common thing for you and you use it.
But today the country wants to do the great work that our dream is Cashless Society.
It's true that a hundred percent of the cashless society is not possible.
But once we have started the Less Cash Society, the goal of Cashless Society will not be complete.
And I would like your active cooperation, time and solemn pledge in this regard and you would never disappoint me because we all are citizens who want to change the lives of the poor people of Hindustan.
You are aware of the opportunity for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking today.
Each bank provides online access.
Every bank in Hindustan has its own mobile app.
Every bank has a daily wallet.
The whiteness of the wallet means e-manibag.
There's a lot of cardpayments.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have Rupe ay card, which was used very little.
Poor people have been using their pulses since the eighth date and it has grown by almost three hundred percent.
Pri-Paid cards are available on mobile phones as well as cards for expenditure incurred in the bank.
And it's as simple as your Hots Appeberta sent.
Phones with common features can also be cashtransfers.
Whether it is smoke or vegetable, milk, news papers, tea or chicken sellers, everyone can use it unnecessarily.
And I also emphasized the need to simplify this system.
All the banks are involved in this.
My young friends, despite all this, there are generations who are strange about these things.
And you are, I know very well that this great work is working.
The kind of creative message on the Hoyts App, you see - slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, smiles, and this creative energy of the younger generation in the face of challenges, it seems as if this India's uniqueness was the birth of Gita in a wartime period of one era.
And that is why today when we have been in such a big transformation then the basic creativity of your heart is becoming visible.
But, my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this thing and Im confident that you, millions and millions of young people of the country will do this thing.
Please do one thing and promise from today that you will be a part of the Cashless Society.
Use the technologies that are available online on your mobile phone.
Not only this, every day, every half an hour, every hour, every two hours, every day, every two hours, every family will be able to understand how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in their accounts and how to provide it to the shopkeepers.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will yourself have to enter this Cashless Society, you will have to give leadership to the great campaign of expelling the society from the cycle of this note, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the drive to get rid of black money, the drive to free people from misery and misery.
I invite you - Come, not just forget, we are soldiers of this change and let us change.
We will carry forward this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where younger generations have changed the lifestyle of that country and the changes that will be accomplished are brought about by youngsters and youngsters.
A mobile system called M-PESA on Kenya Entrepreneurship has used technology, M-PESA has been named and today African businesses in Kenya have made a point of turning their faces.
This country has created a big revolution.
Once again, my young friends, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for taking this campaign forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S to do this thing individually.
You have seen that the most popular actor of this time, Amitabh ji, has been taking forward the Swachhata Abhiyan with great hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts, your ideas and letters, you are reaching MyGov, Narendra Modi App and keeping me in touch with you.
Now at 11 a.m. Mann Ki Baat is being propagated but after the completion of this broadcast, it is being heard in regional languages.
I am grateful to Akashwani, this new initiative that they have taken so that the people of the country will get the opportunity to join the Hindi language everywhere.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
In every corner of India, the festival of Deepavali is celebrated with enthusiasm and fervour.
India is a country where for 365 days there has been a festival in some part of the country.
We have smoothly acknowledged the changes in the festivals in accordance with the customary time and society by culminating several traditional festivals.
But we have been able to see all these things in a better way that in India, for the entire year, the journey of the festival, its explanation, its depth, its impact on every individual - all these things are related to the same principle - moving the individual towards the collection.
Efforts are being made to promote individuals and individuals, to extend their limited thinking from Periasmaz to the universe.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes in India, the festival means the festival of food and beverages, but they also have thought about what season should be celebrated and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how the crops can be linked to the festivals, what kind of reforms should be taken in the direction of disease-free, all our predecessors have shared our scientific ideas with the festival.
Today, the whole world is thinking about it.
The destruction of nature is a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals strengthens the love and affection of nature and makes every person better than a boy.
And science has proved that what kind of changes are brought about in the sea waters of Purnima and Amavasya, which affects the nature and affects the minds of the people.
So far, our vacations have been linked to the universe and have remained a tradition of patronage.
Today, when we are celebrating the festival of Deepavali, as I have said, every festival of ours is academic, it comes with the feeling of education.
The festival of Deepavali gives the message of Tamsoma Awakening from darkness to light.
Social fault- Deepawali is a festival of liberation from darkness to light by lighting lamps from the shadow of personal fault.
We all know this thing very well that we go to any corner of India, we see the cleanliness drive in every household on the occasion of Deepavali, from the richest to the richest.
Every angle of the house is cleaned.
The government of any place in the world, the parliament, the rulers and the people of that place became part of the festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the pictures of the festival of Deepawali with the whole world with pride.
A total of 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament, Indian saris, were photographed outside the Parliament and spread to the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated in every corner of Singapore.
I mean, this festival of Deepawali inspires everyone from dark to light.
The news of the accident during Deepawali, news of the fire, despair is very disturbing.
And there is a problem during Deepawali - many of them go home to celebrate Deepawali with all the families in Deepawali.
It has been going on for a long time from Govardhan Puja, Bhai Phota, Lav Panchami to Karthik Purnima.
It is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But it has a special significance - this festival gives a deep message to society.
There's a proverb that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the next sun is also worshipped.
There is a very big social message in it.
This is the time to express my gratitude to all of you, especially to the people of the country, to convey my best wishes to all of you on this occasion.
In the last few months, every soldier of our army has sacrificed everything for our well-being.
My heartfelt condolences to the sacrifices, meditations and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
And that is why I feel that this Deepawali should be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the countrymen to participate in an expedition called Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down to the fact that there are no people in India who do not have limited love for the army, proud of the army, no pride in the defence forces.
The way people have expressed it will further strengthen the people of the country.
We cannot imagine how strong a message gives them to the soldiers of the security forces.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Air Force or the Coast Guard, I do not know what kind of suffering our soldiers suffer.
When we are taking Diwali then some of them are protecting the airports in the desert, somebody is protecting the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the airports.
I really want to express my gratitude to the people of our country.
The artist, whom he had communicated through industry, who made pictures, alpines, cartoons, whom he wrote poems with the grace of Saraswati.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
Sandesh to Soldiers, how many messages have come to this hashtag.
Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has read a poem and I would like to read it.
I celebrate the festival, Sahass, today I tell you, it's impossible that you are.
My dear countrymen, whose father's house and father-in-law have sent me a telephone message.
Come, let me tell you what this soldier family is saying - Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers and sisters have been encouraged by the launch of the 'Sandesh to Solsars' campaign in Deepawali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the army officers.
This Sandesh has inspired all of us who are on the border and Army Circle.
I would like to say that the army officers and soldiers have to abandon their wives and their entire family.
My dear countrymen, it is a fact that not only the borders that the armed forces are guarding, but their awareness is reflected in many aspects of life.
Our brave soldiers are inspired by patriotism in every sphere of their lives, I have noticed one incident which I would like to tell you.
This discussion shows that some families are not able to build household toilets due to lack of money.
Development has given a boost to the Swachhta Abhiyan by giving 57 families one thousand rupees each from their pockets.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
Nobody goes there easily.
These youngsters walked on their shoulders with bricks, cement and other toilets and reached the forest.
More than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet-free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also been included in this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has planned a lot, if there is a better secondary plan after the first plan, then the first one has to be abolished.
But usually no one pays attention to it.
There is no need for kerosene in all the houses that have gas connections and electricity in our country.
But who keeps the government looking for Arya
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been kerosene-free for the best.
I believe that the entire state will soon become kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always our guide.
What the country will do, how he will do, what his illustrations are still considered as examples.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, you will remember the poor and the weaker sections of the country and think that what you are going to do will be of any use to these people, will they not be harmed
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our ancient beliefs, we have to bridge the gap between sons and daughters in society.
This opportunity is a symbol of distinction among our daughters in the Indian society.
The government is immunized, but lakhs of children are left out of the vaccination programme.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is one such drive which includes survivors, which provides strength to children to get rid of terrible diseases.
The village will remain dark in the 21st century, it will not happen.
In order to make the village free from darkness, the mission of electrifying the village is progressing with success.
Work is going on before the scheduled time.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore households from smoke and this campaign is also progressing successfully.
Small entrepreneurs, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, peasants get stuck on the loans they owe to the Mahajan.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, all these are a successful campaign to get rid of the oppressed.
The Aadhar card is directly accessible to the bank and the actual beneficiaries are getting direct financial benefits.
It's time to get rid of the black money in the lives of common people.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great soul of this country had demonstrated and demonstrated the solidarity of India's unity - Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary.
On 31st October, on the one hand, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the leader of the nation's unity, and Smt. Gandhi's Punya Tithio.
My Lord, you know that 31st October is Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel is an individual who has given up his entire life for integrity and has succeeded in this endeavour.
And we can say the country's misfortune, that day Gandhi was also killed.
And all of us know what happened in the country after his assassination.
My Lord, I want to tell you how we can stop such unfortunate incidents.
Dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
A Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a witness to the historic event, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of bringing the country together after Chanakya.
But it is also a sad sadness that Sardar Saheb had sacrificed his life for unity, fought, had been the main objective of unity of the country.
But on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardar Sahebs have been pushed to death after the assassination of Smt. Gandhi.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great men who have spent their entire life in unity, torture and torture of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, this page of history, hurts us all.
But in this crisis, we have to take forward the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, dresses, food and food, but unity in diversity is the strength of India, this is the speciality of India.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government has a responsibility, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner
We should protect ourselves and our country from the tendency of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb gave us Ek Bharat, the responsibility of all of us is to create a 'Shreshtha Bharat'.
The main mantra of unity is to build a better India.
At present, we have heard the name of 'Amul'.
Today, the people of India and the people of India are also familiar with every product of 'Amul'.
However, few people know that the vision of the far-reaching Sardar Saheb for creating a chamber of Cooperative Producers was envisaged.
We have a live example of how Sardar Saheb had worked for the happiness and prosperity of the farmers of Khara district, which was known as the district at that time in 1942.
I pay my tributes to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, we will remember Sardar Saheb wherever we live on Ekta Diwas.
My dear countrymen, after this Diwali, Karthik Purnima is also a part of the festival of light.
Guru Nanak Jis teachings showcase the right direction for the entire mankind, not only for India but also for the entire humanity.
This is Guru Nanak's message, be it service, truth and good for everyone.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his main mantra.
In every word of Guru Nanak, there was a campaign to free the society from discrimination, blind faith and misdeeds.
I also salute Guru Nanak from the bottom of my heart on the festival of happiness.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion.
Your dreams, your resolves, be successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
Just a few days ago, we lost our eighteen brave sons in an attack on the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage.
And that is why I will tell my countrymen that on that day, I will repeat what I said that the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're proud of our army.
I also want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And those who understand the truth, they have started moving away from all those powers and walking on the path of peace.
Every mother-children should be swift and full-fledged.
Farmers also want their fruits to reach the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, businesses have started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are not only the path of our solution but also the path of our progress and our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will sit together to find solutions to all the problems, find solutions and at the same time make a better way for the sister-in-law of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the people of Kashmir.
The administration has to take some measures to maintain law and order.
I would like to tell the legal guardians that we have the power, the power, the law and the rules are required to maintain the law and order, to give the lives of the people of Kashmir a peaceful and peaceful life.
Sometimes the people of different thoughts nurture different thoughts from what we thought.
I have the opportunity to know a lot in Social Media today.
Every nook and corner of Hindustan provides an opportunity to understand the thoughts of the people and enhances the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, a student of the eastern class, had sent a different kind of feeling to me.
He wrote: "After an attack in Uri, I was very upset.
I had a question as to what I could do for the countrymen.
I make a pledge that every day I will study for three hours.
We will be able to become a citizen of our country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, I am delighted to know that in this environment of consciousness and in such a young age you can imagine well.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastriji had tried to bring this feeling to the entire world.
And he inspired the people with the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kishan' and showed them how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji showcased the patriotic exhibition between bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to drive the movement, when the movement was intensified, there was a need to create an orientation, he used this intensity to further consolidate the constructive work within the society.
Let all of us, the Armed Forces, the people of the administration perform their duties and let us all contribute to this spirit of patriotism and contribute to some constructive work that will take our country to new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Karthik wrote to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who had gone to Para-Olympics had created history and won the victory of the Humanspirit.
Both of you have not only created an emotional attachment for every individual of the country but also for the athletes who participated in the para-olympics.
Perhaps our vision of para-olympics and our sportspersons has completely changed from the point of view of humanity to the handicapped.
And I will never forget this thing of our champion Deepa Malik.
When she got the medal, she said, "I lost the disability through this danger.
There is a lot of strength in this thing.
This time, in Para-Olympics, there were three women from our country, including nineteen women athletes.
In comparison with other sports disabled persons, physical strength, sports strategies become a big thing by printing them - will power, will power, will power.
You will be happy to know and wonder that our sportspersons have won two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal.
The gold medal winner Devendra Jhajjaria brought the gold medal for the second time after twelve years.
Twelve years of age increases so much, once the gold is found, the starvation becomes too much.
But Devendra has shown that the condition of the body, the growing age never let him sleep and he again won the gold medal after twelve years.
He wasn't a Divyang from his birth.
He lost one of his hands because of his electrical shock.
You can imagine that the person who attained the first gold medal at the age of thirty years and the second gold medal at the age of twenty-fifteen years has done so much in his life.
Mariappan won the gold medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
Thangavelu lose his right leg at just five years of age.
Poverty couldn't stand the way he was determined.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't come from a clean family.
In the twenty-first year of his life, he had brought the country a medal in the power of determination, despite physical distress and physical disorders.
The name of the athletes is very victorious.
Varun C.
You won bronze medals at Bhati Hijamp.
In our country, in our society, in our surroundings, all these medals have played a crucial role in changing our vision for our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Very few people know how Divyangjans have performed this time in Para-Olympics.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic contest at the same place.
Not only this, I was shocked when I came to know that the fourth person among the Divyangjans who did not receive any medal, they ran in less time than the gold medal winners among the common man.
In the coming days, India is on the path of creating a smooth scheme for Para-Olympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, I had a wonderful experience in the Navsari of Gujarat last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India organised a Mega Camp for the Divyangjans.
There I met a young girl Gaurishardul, who couldn't see her from the remote forests of Dang district.
The government of India has established a world record on the land of development, which is very important.
Six hundred Divyang people, who could not hear, were provided with machines to listen in an hour.
The incident was found in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that we have set up three world records by the Divyangjans in a day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness should be our habit, it should be the duty of every citizen to create a sense of hatred towards cleanliness.
On the 2nd of October, when we complete two years, I can assert that there has been an increase in awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
I had said, let us move ahead in the direction of cleanliness, let us all say that today we have made every effort to move one step forward.
That is, the country has moved towards 125 crore steps towards cleanliness.
Therefore, every citizen, ruler, government departments or roadsides, bus depots or railway stations, schools and colleges, religious places, hospitals and elderly people from villages and villages have contributed something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we still have to move a long way.
To be healthy, to respect the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters, we must stop the practice of open defecation.
And that is why a campaign for Open Defecation Free (ODF) has been started.
Recently, I had gone to Gujarat where officials have told me that this year, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, Porbandar, will reach the goal of ODF on 2nd October this year.
Congratulations to those who have been successful in this endeavour and congratulations to those who have been successful.
My heartfelt condolences to the countrymen, for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we will be able to free our country from this problem.
Come, let us resolve to move forward.
I want to start a new scheme for young friends, especially those who are used to using technology today.
The government of India has given a telephone number 1969 to know about the status of Swachhata Mission in your city.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
You can call this number in 1969 not only to know the statistics of your city's toilets but also to apply for new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation, take advantage of it.
The Government of India is also urging CorporateWorld to come forward and urge the professional youth to sponsor those who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Personnel.
And along with the Swachhata Mission, we have to move towards Wasteto Compost.
The chemical sercompanis have been told that the compost that was created from the Waste is kinuk.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should get the required juice.
Those who rectify the health of their land, those who are concerned about soil health, those whose chemical fertilizers have been damaged due to the use of chemical fertilizers, they should be able to supply such fertilizers in certain quantities.
Shriman Amitabh Bachchan has joined Brand Ambassador for this purpose.
I see that there is a constant new news about cleanliness.
One day I got the news papers - students from Gujarat University went to 107 villages and started awareness campaigns to build toilets.
The Government of India has also created one year calendar in different sectors.
Each department has been emphasizing on cleanliness for 15 days, especially in the last few days.
My request to the citizens is that if you people are associated with the work done by these government departments then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time, nearly five hundred cities of the population of one lakh people are running.
That is why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind, we will do something good next time.
An atmosphere of competition has been created in the field of cleanliness.
I hope all citizens will participate in this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is completing two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I urge you to buy something or the other from Khadi.
And I would like to urge every family to do something for Khadi so that the lamp of Deepawali burns in the house of the poor.
Though on Sunday, 2nd October, but as a citizen, can we take part in the cleanliness drive anywhere
You should work hard for at least two-four hours for cleanliness and share one of them in the Narendra Modi App.
You can share it when it's a video.
This concerted effort will give strength to this mission, it will give a new impetus.
Come, let us resolve to do something good for the country by remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, there is a different joy in donating life to make a recognition.
In the last few days, I have seen that when I had requested to give up gas subsidy, the way the common man has responded is a very inspiring thing in our national life.
Some of our youths, small organisations, people from corporate world, students from school and members of some voluntary organizations will jointly observe the 'Joy of Giving Week' in several cities from October 8 to October 8.
The objective of the drive is to provide food items, dresses and clothing to the disadvantaged.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers went to different families and collected the old toys in their homes and provided them with the gifts of the poorest of the poor.
It was really a pleasure to see all the poor kids enjoying these toys.
I believe that in the cities where the Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of charity.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all the youngsters who are doing this.
My dear countrymen, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and the birth centenary celebrations of him are being celebrated today.
How can the poorest of the poor benefit from development
He expressed his economic vision of working in all hands and water in all lands.
The nation will celebrate his birth centenary as a 'Grib Kalyan Yojana'.
Societies, governments and others will have to pay attention to how the developmental reformers will be able to get rid of poverty.
My dear countrymen, I had started the Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
The people of the country are always conscious of me, which has always been revealed in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audiences for the manner in which you have encouraged, strengthened and blessed this event on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
I also express my gratitude to the audience that they have not only propagated the programme but have also made every effort to reach out to the audience in all languages.
I also express my gratitude to all those people who have written a letter on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, have expressed their flaws in the government system, have prepared special programmes on all these letters and have created a platform for resolving the problems faced by the similators at the function of the government employees.
That is why Mann Ki Baat is not just a minute-two-minute speech but a new medium of social change.
What could be the reason for anybody's satisfaction
And that is why I thank all those associated with it for making this institution a success.
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durgapuja, Vijaya Dashmir and Deepavali will begin next week.
This prayer of Navratri or Durga Puja Shakti must be worshipped by the unity of the society.
There will be a festival to connect with each other.
It will be the motto of real energy and then we will be able to celebrate the victory festival together.
Come, let us worship Shakti, let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, 29th August is the birthday of the magicians of Hockey.
National Sports Day is being celebrated across the country on this occasion.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and remind all of you of his contribution.
In 1928, 1932 and 1936, he played an important role in winning the Gold in Olympics in India.
We all know Bradman's name.
He used to talk about meditation, He scores goals like runs.
Dhyanchandji was a player inclined to become a vibrant monastery of patriotism and patriotism.
Once upon a match in Kolkata, a hockey stick hits the opponent's head.
There's only 10 minutes left to finish the match.
Dhyanchand ji made three rounds in that 10 minutes and said I was hit by a round-the-clock.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is time for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestions on MyGov portal or Narendra Modi App.
Shriman Ajit Singh wrote in the Narendra Modi App, Please, let us talk about the teachings and participation of MN Ki Baat in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in the ROLP.
Shriman Sachin has written to you, "Mann Ki Baat" will surely mention the work of Hindi, Sakshi and Deepa.
One of them is from North India and one from South India, one from East India and one from any other part of India.
It seems that girls from all over the country have taken the responsibility of brightening the name of India.
Shekha Thakur wrote in MyGov portal, we could have done better in Olympics.
He said, "Dear Modi sir, I thank you for winning two medals in Reo.
But I would like to draw your attention to this thing too - what was the meaning of participation in our extra competition
The answer is: No.
And no one else can do this without you.
Similarly, Smt. Satyaprakash Mehra wrote in the Narendra Modi App, "We need to focus on additional educational programmes in Mann Ki Baat, especially on children and youngsters.
Thousands of people have expressed the same feeling.
There is no way to deny that we can't show the results as expected.
In some cases, it has been said that our sportspersons have not been able to reach the level of the sportspersons.
And we are only two medals in the medal list.
But if we do not realize this thing then we will be able to observe it properly and we will see that the players of India have shown greatness for the first time in some cases.
Look, in the shooting, our Innovative Bindra has occupied the fourth position and he has grabbed medals for a very short period of time.
Deepa Karmakar has also performed well in the field of gymnastics and has secured 4th position and has lost very little medals.
But how can we forget that he was the first Indian woman in Gymnastics to qualify for Olympics and for the Final Festival of Olympics
Almost all this happened in Sania Corps and Rohan Bopanna Jungles.
We've shown good results in athletics this time.
After 32 years, Lalitababar achieved sporting qualifications at Track and Field Finals.
Boxing-Obikash Krishna Jadav reached the end of the quarter, but he couldn't get the bronze medals.
There are many players like Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das and others who have performed very well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we've done this time, maybe we'll be disappointed.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
We will go home and review the sports practices in the world.
We'll build a roadmap of how we can do better.
We have planned the outcome by 2020, 2024, 2028.
I would also urge the state governments to create such a committee and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I also urge the sportspersons to do brainstorming in an indiscriminate manner.
State Governments should review themselves and send their suggestions.
We have to prepare our architects and I believe that we will be able to make a promise to 125 crore Indians, 65 young generations, the best results in the sporting world.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I have spent some time with the students on teaching for years and spent time as a student.
A lot of learning from these little boys.
On 5th September, I have teachers' day as well as educational days.
But now I have to go to G-20summit, so I would like to express this feeling of my heart in Mann Kibat today.
Teacher's place is as much as mother's place in life.
After the recent Rio Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopichand is being discussed again and again.
He's a player, but we've got the proof of how good he is.
Today, I see Gopichand as a greater trainer than a player.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, her meditation, her self-sufficiency towards sports and her success in the success of her disciples.
We always feel the role of a teacher in our lives.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
The nation celebrates this day as the Teachers Day on the birth anniversary of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
Wherever he reached in his life, he always tried to spend his day as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say, "Good teacher is the one in which students never lose.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived a wonderful life even after being the President.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of teachers because they were our models in our small village.
Today, I can say with joy that a teacher of mine who is now ninety years old has written a letter to him every month.
If you have a photograph with your teachers, if you have a good story with your teachers, if you have a message from your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
Look, it is very valuable to see the teachings of the teachers in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh Festival will be celebrated a few days later.
Lord Ganesha removes all obstacles and we all want our country, our society, our family, all our individuals and their lives to be deprived.
Whenever we talk about Ganesh Festival, it is very surprising to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak gave the Ganesh Festival a universal form.
He made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness, a festival of social reform.
All such issues affecting social life through the Ganesh festival should be discussed so that the society becomes a new force, a new dialect in the organisations organized at this time.
At the same time, Lokmanya Tilak, who had given the mantra - Swaraj is our birthright, be it the center of all the discussions.
Nowadays not only Maharashtra but also Ganesha festivals are celebrated everywhere in the country.
The youth, especially the youngsters, enthusiastically started preparations to celebrate the festival.
Why do some people still want to follow the idea of Lokmanya Tilak who started this festival
Discussion meetings, composition competitions, shortcoming competitions were organized on various subjects.
Everything that affects our society is beautifully depicted in the idol process.
In this universal Ganesh Festival, public education campaigns were carried out.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspirational mantra of 'Swaraj is our birthright'.
But now we live in a free India.
We will now say, Su-Raj is our right in this Ganesh festival.
We will move on the path of Suraj, Suraj will be our main demand.
Can't we move ahead with this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
Our lives are impossible without festivals, but we have to change them according to the demands of time.
This time many people have written a lot about me, especially the festival of Ganesh and Durga Puja.
They are particularly concerned about the environment.
An individual named Shankar Narayana Prashant told me: "Modiji, do you know through the Vatsava program that they should not use the Ganesha statue built by the Plaster of Paris and use the Ganesha statue made of the soil of Pushkarini in the village"
Conservation of the environment, conservation of rivers and fountains, and conservation of small creatures living in water from pollution, is the service of God.
Lord Ganesha - Vighanhari.
That's why we don't build a idol that causes disorder.
I don't know how you're gonna take my words, but I'm not the only one who's talking about it.
Environment friendly Ganesha Festival - this is also a social service.
There's still some time left for the cruelty.
Now we have to decide that those old families who constructed idols, if they build idols from Pushkarini or from the river then they will get a chance to earn.
And after the festival, they will be resurrected and the environment will be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will be conferred on Mother Teresa as the Saint on September 4th.
Mother Teresa had spent her entire life in the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud to receive the title of Mother Teresa Saint.
A delegation of officials led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of the Government of India and the Government of India to participate in the 4th September event.
We can always learn something from saints, sages, moons and great men.
I hope we get something new, learn and do something good.
Jan Shakti is considered to be a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the common man with the five States in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan for Clean Ganga.
The villagers present in Allahabad have taken a pledge that they will stop the practice of open defecation in the villages of Niniz, they will not allow toilets to be constructed, they will not allow Ganga to be cleaned, they will be fully involved in the Ganga Safai campaign.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of Panch state who have taken an important step in connecting the people with the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
Boys and girls aged seven to seventeen have done this.
The emotional effect of this letter is that when the students have come to school the next day after receiving the letters, they have been sent to the school teachers of some parents and they will be given toilets in their homes within a certain date.
A 16-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting on a Satyagraha against her family.
When Mohammad Shafi, the village head, came to know that Mallamma was practising for toilets, he paid 18,000 rupees and constructed toilets within a week.
Village leaders like Mallamma, Jeys Shakti and Mohammad Shafi are really remarkable.
This is the manpower that can create a road to solve the problem.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge to someone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their goal.
The Government of India is contemplated and all the people are being told to make a film about Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send it to the Government of India.
Details about this will be available on the website.
It will be a competition and the winners will be awarded on 2nd October on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
I would also like to tell the TV channels that you have made such photographic commentaries.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relations with our neighbours are deep, simple and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important incident took place, the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, graced the Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe some people wonder if the President will embrace a radio channel
But it's not a simple radio channel, it's a very important step.
We are in Pashi Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and the West are taking forward the same cultural traditions.
On the one hand, the Akashwani Maitri and the Akash Vetar on the other, will interact with them, and enjoy the aerial performances of the Bengali musicians on both sides.
Akashwani has contributed greatly to people-to-people contact.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the event.
I would also like to thank Bangladesh who are also associated with it.
I also convey my best wishes to the friends of Akashwani who are playing their part in foreign policy.
This kind of event gives new energy, new inspiration and this is the source of inspiration for the countrymen to do something or the other.
A few days ago, I got a letter that moved my mind.
A mother of about eighty years, a retired teacher, she wrote this letter.
Unless he had ever forbidden his name to be published in the letter, I was very eager to tell you all.
He wrote in the letter: When you applied for gas subsidy, I gave up gas subsidy, then I forgot it.
My countrymen, you know, I tried to send a letter to those who gave up their gas subsidy and some of my delegates were present on their own.
I'm trying to write more than a million letters.
Its not important that fifty thousand rupees are important, it is important that this mother's emotions, the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters like her help us build the future of our country, strengthen and relieve us.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about drought, but in August this month we are constantly in danger of flooding.
There have been floods in some parts of the country several times.
The State Government, the Central Government, the Local Administrative Bodies, the Social Institutions and the Citizens have done everything possible.
But there are reports in this flood that we need to remember more.
Those who are striving to create unrest in Kashmir by moving ahead with these little boys, they must never answer these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, our country is prosperous and rich in diversity.
Thank you very much today
I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
I believe that in the days to come, every youngster will be able to spread the message across the country.
We all know that within a few days, the Mahakumbh of the largest sports event is being organized in the world.
Our ears will be reversed again and again.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a grand and beautiful Run for Rio, Khelo and Live, Sport and Excellence Run.
Wherever I may be, I will do something to encourage our sportspersons.
I will also be with you as a citizen of a country like 125 crore countrymen to encourage all these sportspersons.
Come, let us all glorify each and every sportsperson in the coming days.
Today, when I talk about Rio Olympics, a poem-loving Panjab composed a poem by the student of Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay.
Perhaps there are many more poets who write many poems, perhaps write poems, write poems, do them in every language, but I want to enjoy the poems that Surajji has taught me.
One young man, Shriman Ankit, has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
The country and the world paid homage to Abdul Kalam Ji on his death anniversary last week.
Whenever Abdul Kalam ji was named, the picture of a powerful India of science, technology, missiles and future was shining in front of us.
And that is why your government has written that what is going on to fulfil the dreams of Abdul Kalam ji
If we drag the old technologies out of research and invention, we will be outside the changing ages of this world.
And that is why the government has taken a lot of steps to encourage new generations of science, technology development, research and innovation.
So I would like to say, Let us aim to innovate.
And when I say "Let us aim to innovate" then AIM means "Atal I".
If we need to empower the next generation then we need to connect our children with this work.
And that is why the government of India has taken the initiative to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have a strong and improved laboratory, a framework for innovation, new entrepreneurship, to make it a definite target.
As new laboratories are required, the old laboratories need to be improved.
We have to find technological solutions to these problems every day.
We have urged todays youngsters to come up with Atal Grand Challenges, if there is any problem in your eyes, find technologies to solve them, do research and invent them.
If the Government of India is able to find new technologies to solve our problems, innovators are specially rewarded and encouraged.
I'm glad people are very interested in this.
When we talked about Tinkering Lab, more than thirty thousand schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand academicians and other institutions applied for it.
The State Government and the Union Government have been working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
Even though there are some problems for the rains, the hearts of every person becomes fascinated in the rainy season because the rains and farming are at the centre of our entire financial painting.
Sometimes there is a disease that needs to be absorbed in our life.
However, if we are conscious, alert, conscious of the disease, then it is easy to save the throat.
Try to be cautious about cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Take special care of the children and there is no mistake that dengue is only in a poor settlement, but it is not right.
Happy, prosperous deals with dengue first.
You must have seen the analysis of Doordarshan, but sometimes we are depressed to use it.
My dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention.
Life is so inexhaustible, so there is no need to worry about itself.
I'm sick, I think I'm gonna get cured soon, so I'm gonna get some antibiotic.
My dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics in such a way can be a serious problem.
Maybe you're relaxing for a while, but we should stop eating antibiotics in consultation with doctors.
The microbial tuberculosis and malaria that are rapidly transforming ourselves so that the functionality of the medicine is destroyed.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic registration.
Antibiotics should be used for this purpose.
You must pay attention to it.
Whenever there is talk of health, I would like to add another thing to it.
Sometimes the thoughts of life-threatening mothers in our country are very much concerned.
About three crore women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that in the last one decade, the maternal mortality rate has come down but even today many pregnant mothers are not able to save their lives.
In pregnancy, abnormality, infection during childbirth, high blood pressure, and immunity, no one knows how to destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan in the last few months.
According to the campaign, all pregnant women can be tested at affordable rates on 9th of every month.
Both mothers and children will be able to save their lives. And I specially want to tell the wives that you cannot treat the poor mothers without any financial treatment on the day of the month or on the 9th of the month.
Whether my doctor brothers and sisters cannot afford to spend twelve days of the year for the welfare of the poor
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is particularly concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna had also spoken to the trees in the field of war, we must imagine the importance of thinking about trees in the field of war.
In Geetha, Lord Shri Krishna says, I am amongst all trees.
NASTI MULANG ANOUSHADHAN, there is no such tree which has no medicinal properties.
The tree that gives him crosses the bark like a tree.
Therefore, those mothers and sisters who are for the sake of their welfare, they should plant good trees and raise them like a child.
Our Shastra-Geethahok, Shakracharya Niti or Mahabharata Discipline are some of the present generations who have demonstrated this philosophy of Shastra.
Just a few days ago, I have been reminded of the example of a daughter of Pune, who touched my heart.
In the discipline of Mahabharata, it has been said that trees also perform the duties of children and gold has done so to meet the needs of the society, not only of their parents but also of the society.
Krishandu Maruti Mahatra of Narayanpur village of Punnar Taluk in Maharashtra has given her granddaughter gold marriage in an example.
Other temples can start the tradition of planting trees instead of prasad in this rainy season.
Currently, in order to build houses in India, we have to import timber worth crores of rupees from abroad.
If we plant plant such trees on our edible side, which will be used for making furniture and houses, then you can sell them after 15-20 years with government permission.
This can be a new source of income for you, and to save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have been running a number of campaigns for the benefit of this rainy season, the Government of India has recently passed a CAMPA Act. More than 40,000 crore rupees are being billed for tree plantation by the states.
Rajasthan has observed such a great forest festival in a desert and has taken a pledge to plant twenty five lakh saplings.
25 lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
They will be able to understand the hard work done by those who are in the soil of Janarastra.
Andhra Pradesh has set a target to increase the greenery of the state by 2029.
Under the Green India Mission launched by the Union Government, the Railways is making it greener.
Gujarat also has a bright continuation of the Forest Festival.
This year, Gujarat has observed several schemes called Amban, Ektawan and Shahid Van as forest fertilizers and has launched a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I can't mention all the kingdoms, but everyone deserves to be praised.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had a chance to visit South Africa.
This is my first journey, and whenever there is a foreign journey, it is a matter of conspiracy, business and business, discussions about safety, sometimes a 'mouth' significance, all these things have to be done.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever we recall South Africa, we recall Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever the words of non-violence, love, forgiveness are heard in this world, their faces are visible to us.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Settlement, which is known as Sarvodaya, the house of Mahatma Gandhi.
I am fortunate to visit the Petermaritzburg station on which Mahatma Gandhi had visited, which was discovered in the event of the train. But I would like to say that this time I had the opportunity to interact with the great people who have lived their lives for the equality of all, for the equality of all.
Even after doing so much penance, there was no need to take anything on their faces, nothing to do with it.
I would like to see the duties that have been mentioned in Geetha.
I'll remember that interview forever.
There cannot be a mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any society or any government.
This is the path that leads us to a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future for our children- everyone needs differently.
Priority can be different, but the path is the same, the path is equitable, equal opportunity, the feeling of equality and the feeling of oneself.
Come, let us take pride in the Indians who have lived in South Africa as well as the main mantra of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Burma, he has told me about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am an artist Burma from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I have read a paper that a gentleman has committed suicide by cheating and cheating eleven lakh rupees.
I have enough condolences for his family as a woman.
I would like to know what you are thinking about these fraudulent and fake e-mails.
"Some people forget the money.
This is a new way of evolution through technology that is spreading all over the world.
On the one hand, technology has played a major role in economic development, on the other hand, people who abuse it have also landed in the field.
You must have made a mistake at some point of time because they have written so beautifully that it looks like they're real.
Your credit card, you know the number of debit cards, and your bank accounts are vacated through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, digital fraud.
We have to stay away from this kind of mood, stay alert, and we have to share such false messages with our friends and friends and warn them too.
Our MPs also take people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to them and talk to them about their problems.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
You've got a nice picture at the station.
Not only A, they also found the plastic bottles or oil cane in the village and planted it and planted it and made it a vertical garden.
Thus, they have given a new shape to the tarelestation.
If you ever visit Aligarh, you will definitely see the station.
There's a new feeling.
This is an example of a change in the participation of the people.
Thanks to those who have been doing such work in the country, especially my friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals begins in our country when it rains.
Festivals will be held in different parts of the country in the coming days.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temple, in the worship place, and you will also celebrate the festival at home and outside.
Rakhibandhan is an important festival for us.
Can't you give the mothers and sisters the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan last year
My dear countrymen, we have a lot of people who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in a free India.
On 8th August, the 'Bharatchho' movement was launched, this year it will be 75 years and on 15th August it will be 70 years of independence.
We are enjoying our freedom and taking pride in being a free citizen. This is a moment to remind all those who brought freedom.
75 years of the uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can give us new inspiration, new inspiration, and it can be time to make a solemn pledge to do something good for the country.
My hopes are that you will do some good work in the inspiration of Swadesh Prem.
And nowadays technology has become so affordable that whatever thing you can easily deliver to me, I invite you, let us remember the lives of our freedom fighters.
Everybody plans on vacation.
And this is our season, so maybe I'll taste it.
Sometimes it seems that if you get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it is very good.
But this time the hot summer has snatched all the fun in the past.
The thoughts of the countrymen are very natural.
And all the places that have been stored to collect water are also decreasing due to continuous drought.
Therefore, there is a lot of sensitivity towards water and efforts are being made to conserve water.
Just a few days ago, someone had told me that the Bazaar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of the district of Ahmednagar in Maharashtra had given a lot of emphasis on the need for water in the village.
They have decided to abandon the cultivation of all the crops like sugarcane, banana etc.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
All of you made a solemn pledge
If a factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the plant, because the use of water is high, then you know the consequences.
It's true that I'm talking about a small village in Hebrew, but there's a lot more villages like this.
I congratulate all the villagers for this kind of good work.
I have been told by the public that the Gorba Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to construct agri-forest lakes in their efforts.
They had constructed about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to an increase in groundwater levels, water had risen very high.
I'll tell you they're more complimentary than railways.
The nature of human beings is that no matter how much the day is in danger, if there is any good news, it seems to be dangerous.
From 106 to 110 percent of the rainfall, it seems as if there was a message of great peace.
There is still a delay in the arrival of rains, but the news of good rainfall has created a new inspiration.
The farmers need soil, the fields are useful for their crops.
Can't we take the soil from the village pond and pour it into the field
It will also improve the field and increase the power of water conservation.
Sometimes in the cement slums, sometimes in the empty slums of serpents, stones and soil filled with water, can water be saved
Water levels will rise, our wells will get water.
So we need to save as much water as we can.
The rain water, the water of the village will remain in the village and if we do something for this purpose then it will be possible only by collective efforts.
So today the water crisis is good, the drought is going on, but we have time for the next one and a half months.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked MyGov: Will the Ganga Safai Abhiyan be possible in our lives
How many governments have come and how many schemes have been created and a lot has been spent.
And that is why it is natural for millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to ask this question.
The Ganga provides us with a hustle-bustle, and it gives us a new strength to live.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economy of the country.
One Bhagirath brought us to the Ganges, but it requires crores of devotees to save it.
This will never be possible without the support of the people.
We need to be a change agent for cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several schemes are being taken up by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from all the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to unite social and voluntary organizations.
Several measures have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and plantations.
Every day there is a huge amount of garbage in the Ganges through drainage.
Trash skimmers are cleaning the waste water in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. to clean the waste.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularise the work of waste management.
Earlier, I was told that where efforts are made, we can clean up 3 to 11 tons of garbage every day.
So it's true that we're gonna be able to clean up a large amount of waste.
Trash skimmers are planned to be installed in some other places in the coming days.
And the people along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will be able to understand it very soon, an effective plan has been prepared to control the pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry.
Elimination of waste from the plant at Pulp and Paper Industries Bblack Liquor is almost completely closed.
All these things have proved that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
Financial support is also being provided to the people for the cleanliness of the Ganges, which is why this work is being done very well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
The day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Diwas in India.
Today, Panchayati Raj system has been started in our country.
And today Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as an important unit of our democracy.
On 14th April, we observed the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, and today 24th April is observing Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a beautiful affinity, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He inspired people to do this important work of connecting the village with the Constitution.
For this purpose, from April 14th to April 24th, the 10th day of his birth anniversary, Bharatodaya Abhiyan has been organised.
It is my privilege that on 14th April, on the occasion of his birth anniversary, I had the opportunity to pay my homage at that holy place.
Today, on 24th, I will observe Panchayati Raj Diwas in Jharkhand where most tribal brothers and sisters are present.
Once again, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country at 3:30 pm.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
At the same time, all these programmes have been going on for ten days in so many villages of India.
I congratulate all the state governments and village heads for this thing.
You have utilized this opportunity to further strengthen democracy for the betterment and prosperity of the village in a very basic and new way.
And that is why all of us will be able to get the epic results as much as we can emphasise on the rise of the village.
From Mumbai, Sharmila called on the borrower and expressed her thoughts.
- Prime Minister Namaskar
I'm from Mumbai to Sharmila borrower.
You have questions about my school and college education.
For example, there has been a need to amend the education sector over the last several years.
Today, if every family has a dream, then it is a child's education.
Come home and car.
In a country like India, this idea is for the education of children, for the education of them, for the education of their children.
I would like to enhance this feeling of good education to the child and there should be more awareness about it.
I would like to urge all the parents and parents to discuss the programmes of the school with the children for a long time.
And if you think of anything, go to school and discuss with the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing our educational scarcity.
And it must be possible with everyone's participation.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and they have tried their own way.
And it is also true that for a long time our focus has been on creating educational institutions, expanding the education system, building schools and colleges, appointing teachers, attending many children's schools etc.
We have done a great job in the field of education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education through literature campaign should be our main goal.
So far, infrastructure needs to be accounted for.
Now we need to calculate the achievements of education.
Until now, how many students have come to school were emphasized.
Affordable, affordable, affordable and sustainable specifications were kept in mind.
But now we have to focus on providing good and efficient education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Attempts are being made to focus on good education.
It's true that there's a lot of way left.
If we decide on 125 crore Indians then we will be able to cross this path.
However, it is true that there is a need to bring about changes in our thinking as well.
You must have noticed that some work has been done outside the conventional concept in the budget.
Out of the budget, 10 Government Universities and 10 Basery Universities have been asked to free from government bonds and ask them to know what challenges they are facing to be the best universities.
Universities in India can compete with other universities in the world and also make such competitions.
Along with this, education is important and important things are skills.
That is why technology will play a very big role in education.
Tele-education technology will make our education easier.
And I believe we will understand the results in the near future.
Your Excellency, Namaskar
I'm from Bijnor to Meena Karnwal.
Young people have an important role to play with writing and sports on this day.
They need to work in a collective manner, and have qualities of good leadership so that their overall development can be achieved.
I want you to inspire a large number of youngsters, I want the government to encourage more and more NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
You have sent me so many proposals that before I could talk to you, I would like to talk to NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides etc.
I have reiterated my request to all of you that the leaders of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides, Red Cross, Nehru Yuva Kendras were present.
When I asked them when they had earlier met together, they told me that they had attended such a meeting for the first time since independence.
Now I've put some of these things in front of them.
I told them, why don't our young friends take part in water conservation during this summer
There was such a conversation with them.
I see it as an alarming thing between us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that in the last few elections, there have been a lot of discussions about which party will provide gas cylinders.
On the other hand, the economists asked to reduce gas subsidies.
Some committees also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all the experience.
I had said this but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
1 crore households have voluntarily released gas subsidies.
And this one million family is not rich.
I see that among those who have left the SubCD, some of them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers, families of middle class or lower middle class.
However, it has been observed that more than 80 per cent of those families who have left the gas subsidies have gone to the distributors and left the gas subsidies by standing in line.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives up a little bit in taxes, the government can appreciate it on weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, subsidies are considered to be a kind of right.
But one crore families have left the subsidies.
First of all, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to one crore families because they have made political leaders think fresh.
The world's economists, whoever does this, present such a financial outcome.
Sometimes I feel that we declare that there will be no ticket examiners on this route of railways.
We can do a lot of tests like this.
If we believe in the people of the country then we can achieve the desired results.
Anyway, it's your opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create an environment like this.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader but one crore families of the country have created this environment.
All breaking news is bad news.
Is there nothing good in this country about 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again and again.
A few days ago, on behalf of a news paper, he wrote to me that on Monday, they will not print any disappointing news.
And everybody wants people to get the right and good news.
It is better if a well-known person speaks good words, chants good words and presents them in a better way than the effects of that.
Good news inspires us to do good work.
It's right, it's very important to focus on good. It's gonna be worse than you.
If the lamp burns, darkness will go away, it will happen
Perhaps you are aware that for this reason a website has been opened on the government's behalf - Transforming India website has been published.
It's not just the government, it's the public that you can send any good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Raviji, you have given good advice, but please don't be angry with me.
We will collectively strive to work constructively, to talk constructively, to achieve constructive goals.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourists .
Very few people around the world are aware that millions of people have come to the bank of the river for so long.
Calm down, this fair is finished in a quiet environment.
These events, in an institutional sense, create a huge glimpse of the peoples participation in the event management vision.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading the pictures of Simhastha Kumbh.
I want the Government of India and the State Tourism Department to organize a competition in these pictures.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He said that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness and not only should cleanliness be stuck in this campus, but they want to take the message of cleanliness from the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can make it a social interaction.
We can also build a cultural area.
This can be an opportunity to reach the villages of Sat Talent, Sat Abhaas.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchayati Raj, I will meet you once again. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I have always waited for Mann Ki Baat on my behalf and on your behalf.
This time too, I have seen a large number of letters, comments, phone calls, including many stories, suggestions, inspiration.
I think you're taking my exams.
In spite of this, I would like to share my thoughts with you people once again, in the direction of Mann Ki Baat.
You must be reminded that last time I had discussed a book on Prem Chandjis stories and we had decided that if anyone reads a book, some of them would be shared with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I have seen a large number of people shared information about various types of books.
I am glad to see people discussing books on science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, trade and self-reliance.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But one thing I have to admit is that I don't have much time to read.
But I feel that we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want this books to become an active platform for corner, reader and writer.
Friends, I feel that earlier I had touched the issue of water conservation in Mann Ki Baat but today I feel that this water conservation issue was like touching your hearts before I was told, it was a matter of concern for the common man.
I feel that the recent issue of water has shaken the hearts of your countrymen.
A lot of efforts are being made to conserve water throughout the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
Several innovative campaigns have been launched on the conservation of Media.
This will not only prevent land degradation and crop failure, but also provide water to the fields.
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the North-Eastern states of Meghalaya, the first state in the country, has nurtured its own water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs in this time.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all walks of life come to this fair.
We can organize exhibitions to save water here, dramatically reach the venue and provide water conservation along with the festival.
That's why I want to tell you about some children today.
These are Nidhi Biptu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Ravat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Anantesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
You will be proud of what I would like to say about them.
We all know, "Cancer" is a word that scares the whole world.
It looks like death stands in the clutches.
But these ten children have not only defeated cancer-like illnesses in the war of life, but have also brightened India's name throughout the world with their achievements.
In sports, we often see a sportsperson champion after winning a tournament or after winning a medal, but this is a rare experience, where they have become champions before participating in the match and then champions in the life war.
This month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, drama, swimming, race, football, table tennis are organized.
The ten artisans of our country have won medals in this event.
Some of them have won many medals again.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you are proud of the success of India in the remotest part of the sky - Chandrayaan 2.
From Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Sanjeev Haripura, Kolkata to Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana to P.
Many like Arvind Rao have written on Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed interest in discussing Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, 2019 is a very good year for India from the point of view of space research.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March and then launched the A-Sat.
During the elections, it was not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-Sat.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a satellite 300 km away.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this goal.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire nation has seen how Chandrayaan 2 has moved from Sriharikota towards the space.
All the successful launch of Chandrayaan 2 has made the country proud, powerful and happy.
Chandrayaan 2 is a special mission.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an Indian initiative.
It is an Indian in life.
It's a completely indigenous mission.
It is unprecedented that our scientists had launched Chandrayaan-2 by fixing all the technological problems in record time, day and night.
We have to face such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always remember that we have the ability to overcome this barrier.
I firmly believe that this Chandrayaan 2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the final truth that science is the path of development.
We are now waiting for the month of September with keen interest when two lander Vikram and Rover will land on the Moon land.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to invite all the students of my country, my young friends for an interesting competition and a competition and invite the youth of the country to come up with a quiz competition.
Asked about space and space, Indias space expedition, science and technology are the main issues of this questionnaire: what to do if we launch a rocket, how to send a satellite to orbit or what we can know from this satellite or satellite.
I would like to urge my young friends to participate in this uiz Competition and make it more amnesty and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those artisans but for that you will have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the maximum number.
My dear countrymen, you will be aware of the fact that our Mann Ki Baat has given several momentum to the Swachhata Abhiyan.
The efforts that have been made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago has now been a new benchmark of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not yet achieved a paradigm shift in Swachhata but the way Swachhata Abhiyan has achieved in public places due to the anti-defecation campaign, it is a result of the will power of 130 crore Indians.
But that's why we don't stop.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching the news of Shri Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has left his job in America to serve Mother India.
A few days ago, he took the responsibility of not only making Delhi clean but also making it beautiful.
He started beautification of Lodhi Garden with his team.
Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi are being decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he made the huts beautiful from the walls of the overbridge and the school, many more started coming forward and this way the work started moving.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team played a very important role in this regard.
There may not be any words on the color and the lines, but the thread in the pictures made by them is more meaningful than thousands of words.
We have also observed this beauty in Swachhata Abhiyan.
It is very important that we make efforts to build resources from waste to wealth in our lives.
That is, we have to move forward to make gold from the waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read an interesting comment on the MyGov portal.
Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Sopian District of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to say that I play an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme 'Back to Village' in my state Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in June.
I think this event should be organized every three months.
Further, the event should be organized online monitoring.
I believe that this is the first such event where people could talk directly to the government.
Brother Aslam ji, after reading the message that he had sent me, my interest in knowing about the Back to Village has increased, so I read in detail about it and then I feel that it needs to be informed to the entire country.
The people of Kashmir, however, are keen to connect with the mainstream of development of the country.
They also came to know that the villagers are getting government services.
How can their income be increased
Some more things were added to the programme to make it more attractive.
Childrens Sports Competition was organized under the Khelo India scheme.
The event was distributed sports equipment, Manrega Project Generation Cards and ST Certificates.
Economic Literacy camps were opened and stalls were provided to government departments like agriculture, horticulture etc.
Thus, the event had become a development festival.
It was a festival of public participation, a festival of public awakening.
The people of Kashmir were very happy with this development festival.
Any officer was so impressed with the warm reception given by the villagers that they migrated to that village for more than two days.
It is a matter of great pleasure for the participation of a large number of people in rural enterprises in these areas and the partnership in planning for their betterment.
This is a wonderful outcome of new zeal and new resolve.
This kind of programmes and peoples participation in it proves that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance and the power of progress is always more evidence of this thing than the power of bombs.
Those who want to spread hatred in the path of development and stop progress, they will never succeed in their hatred.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Vendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, describing the form of Shravanamas in one of his poems, said, "Agentalignna, Drag Bhoomi Magna, which means the bonds of rain and Baridhara are unparalleled.
In this season, whenever we look around, it looks like the skulls have covered the green sheet.
The festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated during this period.
You will be happy to know that during the last four years, the maximum number of pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than all the pilgrims who had participated in this journey for 60 days in 2015, the pilgrims have joined in just 28 days.
I especially commend the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have come back after the journey have brought the people of that state with warm memories of hospitality and care.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims visited Kedarnath Dham in the last one and a half months since the four Dham Yatra started in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time since the enormous natural calamity in 2013, a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you, to all those regions of the country where the beauty, the rainy season is spectacular.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage may not be a bigger teacher than this.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and lively month of Shravan will bring new energy, new hope and new zeal to all of you.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains occurred in different parts of the country.
When we watch TV, there's a flood all around in the rain, there's water, traffic jam.
Another picture of the rains is that you will have to come out with your family to see the farmers, the birds' chirping, the waterfalls flowing, the springs of green cover.
Rain, freshness and happiness bring together both of you, my best wishes to all of you for this continuous joy.
My dear countrymen, where do we start from Mann Ki Baat, where do we stop
I'll be back after waiting for a month.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, all of you are busy in exams.
Some people may have finished the test.
And some people are being dragged because on the one hand there is a test, on the other the T20 Cricket World Cup.
Even today, you may be waiting for the match between India and Australia.
Today, India will be playing with Australia and I convey my best wishes to the players of both the countries.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been continuously depressed - we are going to lose - we are going back and forth.
Now our place has come down so low in 1947 that we can't dare to talk.
Throughout this year, we can create a soccer-football environment.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our young generation, our school children sweat them.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of them go to their own state somewhere or the other for five days or seven days.
Some people go outside the kingdom.
I told you earlier, upload the photo from wherever you don't go.
We have to take this task forward.
Now you should do the same thing, but now you should write something with him - not just a photo.
And he is said to be A Traveler without observation is abird without wing.
If you're fond of seeing good things, you're gonna have to make sight.
And I'm lucky I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, I was a young man like you.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I have no opportunity to go.
Tourism has a big role to play in creating life.
And now the youth of India is going to tourism with courage and passion.
I believe this is a very good example.
Our younger generation should be brave and should be able to reach where no one has stepped.
I want to especially thank Coal India.
Then I'll stay away.
When we see the pictures of the people there, we think it's good to go there.
And the thing is that the coal is black, so people get away from the mine.
But the coal mines have become a tourist destination
And I am glad that more than ten thousand people have visited the Environment Friendly Mines Tourism Centre in Saon village near Nagpur.
This place gives you a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on vacation, you will be able to do something about cleanliness.
Maybe it doesn't work too scientifically, but it's happening.
Wouldn't you like to give importance to the cleanliness of the tourist centre as a tourist
I firmly believe that our young friends will definitely help in this regard.
Therefore, there is a lot of potential for employment from tourism.
India is still lagging behind in tourism compared to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that our tourism needs to be strengthened then we must attract the entire world.
We can thus draw a large part of the world tourism to ourselves.
And then it will be possible to provide employment opportunities to millions of youngsters in our country.
Whether it is the government or the organization or the society or the citizens, we all have to do this together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the vacations just come and go away - I don't like it.
You should also think about it.
Will you let your vacations, your important years of life, these moments of greatness go away like this
How many things I am talking about - you can imagine.
Can't you take a pledge to add even more value to your personalities on this vacation
If you don't know how to swim, you can pledge to swim on vacation.
If you don't know how to drive a bike, you'll learn to drive a bike on a holiday.
Do something for your personal development during the vacation, for your strength and for your efficiency.
Not only the areas that I have talked about, but there is a lot of opportunity to do more than that.
This will enhance your personality, your confidence and confidence.
We're gonna talk about it among friends.
This time some suggestions have been received at the MyGov portal for Mann Ki Baat.
Like "My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I am delighted to be here and I have been friends with many birds.
I request you to repeat this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this boy by the name of Abhishek Vedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me he's been doing this all year and many birds have become his friends.
The great poet Mahadevi Varma loved the birds very much.
In his poem, he wrote: "I will not let you go away, I will fill up the pots, I will fill the pots with sweet cold water.
Come, let us make this message of Mahadevi ji work.
I convey my best wishes to her and also thank you for reminding me of the very important thing.
From Mysore to Shilpa Cook has given us a very sensitive topic.
He said, we have a milkman, a newspaper, a postman.
Sometimes a dresser, a cloth seller goes that way.
Have we ever invited them to drink water during the summer
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of young people in the city
If you download this app on your mobile phone, you will get a lot of information about agriculture and climate.
This app has a wide range of topics like market conditions, pickery market conditions, availability of good crops, availability of suitable medicines etc.
And if you put any questions in front of them, they will answer it and will also explain it to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time before the start of farming is very important for farmers.
Can't we dig those old places once again, keep them clean so that they can save more water
You might have seen that efforts have been made to construct 5 lakh ponds and farm land ponds.
Under the MNREGA scheme, we have been emphasizing upon creating resources through water conservation.
How to save water from villages and villages, how to save every drop of rain in the coming days, how to live in the villages, how to start this awareness campaign.
You must join various government schemes to create a mass movement for water conservation.
There are so many villages in the country, there are so many progressive farmers, there are so many aware citizens who are doing this thing.
But we have to go further.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing, just a few days ago, the government of India organized a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how many modern technologies have been brought about and how many changes have been brought about in agriculture.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now farmers are saying that we need to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to you.
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers makes our mother sick.
But if good spices are given in large quantities, what do you like eating that
Whatever be the best fertilizer, excessive use of these fertilizers will cause harm.
Everything needs to be used as per need.
This reduces the cost, saves the money.
I hope that we will be able to finish this task with full focus on water conservation.
The more water will survive, the more it will benefit the farmers, the more it will save their lives.
My dear countrymen, 7th April is World Health Day.
This year, the theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that calls all other diseases.
Once there is a diabetes, a very sick guest enters his home and body.
According to the statistics, in 2014, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent of deaths are due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, parents, and there is a possibility of children.
And the reason for type 2 is badness, aging and excessive weight.
The whole world is worried about diabetes, so on 7th, the theme of World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
Kayik's hard work is going down.
There's no smell in the sweat.
It's not moving.
We're playing online too.
Nothing's going on in offline.
If you are interested in yoga then practice yoga.
Otherwise, at least run.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then India will be healthy.
And now all the privileges are easily accessible.
You must think about it.
TB Day was celebrated on March 24, 2019.
When I was a kid, I was afraid to hear the name of Tuberculosis.
But when tuberculosis was due to death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care about TB.
The number of TB patients in our country is much higher than in the world.
If we get rid of TB, we need proper treatment and comprehensive treatment, we need proper and complete treatment.
If you leave the treatment in the middle, there's a new problem.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also advise for check-ups.
It means it's a disease that needs a quick test.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 microscope centres, more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Treat properly and continue till the disease is eradicated.
I would like to appeal to you, be it TB or diabetes, we have to defeat them.
India has to be freed from these diseases.
But this will not only be done by the government, doctors and medicines until you come forward.
And that is why today I appeal to the countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important days are coming in April, especially on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar on 14th April.
His 125th birth anniversary was accompanied by Dhammadham in the entire country.
He is the birthplace of a mahu of Panchteerth.
Her study in London, Deepaksha at Nagpur.
I am fortunate that this year, on 14th April, the birthplace of revered Babasaheb Ambedkar will be the privilege of Mahu.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become responsible citizens of the country.
Following this path, we can pay tribute to him as a responsible citizen of the country.
The festival is celebrated in different states, in different names.
Some people call it 'Nab Samvatsar', some people call it 'Gudi-Papa' or 'Varsha Pratipada' or 'Ugadi'.
You know, I have told you last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme will be able to listen to your mobile phones in almost 20 languages.
You just have to make a missed call.
It has been only a month, and I am glad that about 35 lakh people have benefited from it.
You can also write the number 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
I'll be glad to join you.
I want to be your partner in this regard too.
I am equally concerned about your children's exams.
However, if we change our thinking process about the tests, then perhaps we will be free from worry.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send me through your suggestion Narendra Modi App.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to parents, examinees and teachers in a special way.
I want to tell you something from what I've heard, what I read, what I've been told.
I know, the exams are about to begin in a few days.
How many percent will you get in the exam
I'd like to say that you set a target for yourself.
Don't stress yourself for someone else's hopes.
You must work hard, but you must set a goal for yourself and try to touch this goal.
When I was playing cricket, I also had a lot of expectations.
Just as time has passed, people's expectations have increased.
It was very important for me to get a solution.
I thought I'd expect myself and set a target for myself.
And if I set my own goals and achieve that goal then I must do something good for the country.
And I have always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was always on the table and that is why the goal has gradually been fulfilled.
And I believe God will give you good results.
Good luck
Don't ever read with hope.
You have to prepare your future.
Make your goal yourself fixed.
Why would I waste my time in competing with others
Why don't I try to break all my records
Friends, don't think of the number game.
Life should always be guided by a great objective - a dream should be guided.
Whether we are moving in the right direction or whether we are moving properly, this test is a test of his instruction.
So if there's any shortcomings to meet the expectations, don't be disappointed.
Increase the spirit of hard work and effort.
Thousands of people have written small words through mobile phones on my App.
Shree Gupta said that the healthy mind lives in the body.
Scholars, focus on your studies and your health so that you can get the tests done properly.
However, for 365 days, our daily routine should be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specifically asked him to sleep at the right time and asked him to revise at dawn.
Prabhakar Reddy has said that we should reach the test centre with admit cards and other papers.
I couldn't talk about it, because I'm a little depressed about sleeping.
And when I talked about sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the test.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping to be stress-free for a good test.
I'm sure you don't.
I believe you won't do that.
It is essential to strengthen the foundation of chaos and success in life.
Discipline creates a strong foundation of life.
The irregularity and disorder that works in the morning, works in the afternoon, seems to have been done.
I don't think anybody's small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes the test takers are both.
One, they're concentrating on what's reading, what's learned, what's good.
Secondly, there are other examiners who don't know what questions, what kind of questions will come, what can we do to solve
I have seen two types of test takers like this that the question paper will not be difficult.
There is a lot of similarity of tests with sports.
When you're playing, you don't know what the boat's tricks will come, just like you don't know, you don't know.
So if you're calm, eat properly, sleep enough, your brain will remember the correct answer to the right question in the right moment.
I don't expect to be very high - just look at it as a challenge. Think, can I remember what I've learnt for years, can I answer these questions
So be calm, sleep well at night, don't be too self-defeating, but don't be negative.
I've seen your exams are better than your fears about the exams.
So, be confident and best wishes for you.
Viswanathan joy has really been a very important thing.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that Arjun's life was only a bird's eye.
I have seen that Viswanathan Anand is fully focused on his vision and that is a reflection of his spiritual peace.
Don't talk to friends, stay alone, be comfortable, sweep a lot of books in the last minute so you can't keep your mind calm.
Smile with a lot of smiles and smiles with friends. Look, you will be calm.
But if the water is not calm, nothing can be seen.
Then I feel that if I take some rest then I would like it - that is why I have created a system for myself.
Deep breathing.
I breathe deeply three times.
Sometimes it crosses 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes absolutely calm, it becomes perfect to understand something.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Because most of the time we see that we are humiliating by examining what is right and what is wrong
If parents are educated at home then they should write about what they have written in the entire account.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
It's done what happened during the test.
Talk to the family about other things, remember the smile of the day when they leave.
If you want to go somewhere with your parents then remember that.
Spend at least half an hour without examining.
In the current perspective, he is trying to reach out to the world about the importance of 'Maintenance Manas'.
Revered Murari Bapu has given some important suggestions for the students.
And whatever the situation is, accept him.
In my experience, we can be mentally pleased and happy if we adapt to the situation.
Without any tension, it will definitely be successful if you sit in a happy examination.
And if you succeed, you will not be sad for failure.
We are grateful for the advice given by the revered Muraribapu to all of us.
Friends, today I want to talk about another thing.
My mobile app is Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
Yes.
But friends, if I say that Yoga is going to start from tomorrow morning then it will be wrong for you.
But those who do yoga exercises will not do this today because they are tested.
If you practice yoga then do it.
If you don't practice yoga before examining, if you know about Yoga, if you have any person who knows about it, please contact him who can do it within 2-4-5 minutes.
Why do you have to hurry
Make your day-to-day schedule in such a way that even if you get stuck in traffic jams, you can get timely tests.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety.
And one thing, I think it's going to be a waste of time if you read the instructions on the question paper.
I have seen that whenever we get the question papers, we dont understand, but if we read the instructions properly, we can adapt ourselves to them and decide how to move forward.
It's very important to understand the questions.
Rao stressed on patience, he advised all the test takers in a very short time.
That's what I call my young friends.
At the same time, we have a lot of opportunities in our country.
What you need is jealousy, self-sufficiency and ability to hold.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for encouraging the children of the country, for their determination, dedication and meditation, that is self-reliance, concentration and hard work.
Hold on, guys. Hold on.
If you're awake, you're afraid.
The bright future is waiting for you to do well.
My app, Ruchika Dubs shared his experiments.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electric bull, and we've read about him in our syllabus.
However, today the light of that power - the light of that bubble is illuminating the lives of the people - that is why the seeds of success are inherent in failures.
He had no legal education in Mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world today.
But it wasn't in the beginning.
He had to face so many difficulties, how many failures he had to face.
Nowadays, the examinations are not only for the students but also for the entire family, schools and teachers.
However, the situation of students is not suitable without the collaboration between parents and teachers.
It becomes easier to examine a team of teachers, parents, even senior students, and move forward with a concerted approach.
Shri Keshab Vaishno Devi, I wrote my app, he complained that for getting more numbers, parents should not be pressurized.
I just need to encourage you to be ready.
We need to think that they are worried.
Writing Vijay Jindal, don't stress your hopes on the children.
Get their courage as far as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that especially my young friends, our present lifestyle has changed a lot from our ancient generations.
We want to move forward with science at the same speed.
Friends, I am talking about this because today is National Science Day.
Every year on February 20th, we celebrate National Science Day.
Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of the Raman Effect.
He received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
That is why February is celebrated as National Science Day.
Johnny of Science.
Scientific thinking, attraction for science creates new ideas and on the other hand, new ideas cannot be created without science and technology.
I am C.
I salute Raman, and urge all of you to enhance your interest in science.
Friends, sometimes there is a lot of delay in achieving success and when success is achieved then the perspective of seeing the world changes.
Perhaps because of your busy scrutiny, you might have noticed a lot, but I would like to remind my countrymen that you might have heard that there has been a very important discovery of science in the world.
Our scientists have identified gravitation waves in their power.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will continue to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, we have taken a very important decision in the last few days.
There are only two such systems in the world.
India is third.
I once again thank all the scientists.
My dear countrymen, this is the number one, you will hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow with a missed call.
You will also hear in your mother tongue.
81908 81908, I repeat 81908.
Friends, your exams are on.
I'll have to test tomorrow too.
125 crore Indians will take my exams.
29 February - It's a lip year.
Yes, you must have seen how healthy I am, how confident I am.
I will be tested tomorrow. You will start tomorrow.
If we all succeed, the entire nation will succeed.
Thank you very much
This is my last Mann Ki Baat programme in 2015.
The next will be Mann Ki Baat in 2016.
A few days ago, we followed Christmas, and now we are preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is a diverse nation.
There are different festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country with festivals and economies.
Festivals are a means of livelihood for the poorest of the poor.
I also convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and convey my best wishes to the people of Christmas for the New Year 2016.
May 2016 bring immense happiness for all of you.
New joy, new hope, new resolve to scale new heights of your life.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamity or other humanitarian crises, the Earth remains free from everything.
You people are aware that I use technology completely and I can learn a lot from it.
Many go out of Christmas vacation.
In the tourism sector, it is focussed on all other facilities, but it is a special focus that we should have a special interest in keeping the tourist destinations clean.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the brighter the picture of India will be on the world front.
I welcome the vision of Shri Sauleswarkar and convey his words to the people of the country.
He did a remarkable job, published in the newspaper.
That's why I think I'll get it to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, had decided that if a villager collects equipment for toilets, he will construct toilets without any remuneration.
Considering this work as sacred, he has worked hard in Bhojpura village so far to construct 100 toilets.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear disappointing things about our country.
As a result of the collective efforts of all people, our country is progressing at a rapid pace.
125 crore countrymen are moving ahead together and taking the country forward.
We have been able to create new opportunities for better education, new technologies and livelihoods, banking opportunities for citizens from insurance protection, new reforms in the global business era and new business infrastructure.
For the people of ordinary families who could not reach Dorgoda in the bank, I have easily provided loans through Mudra Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the world was attracted to yoga exercises and when all the countries of the world came together on the occasion of International Day of Yoga, it gave us confidence that this is our nation-Great India.
When this kind of feelings are created in our minds then a wonderful picture comes out in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is heard in every household.
Public participation is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach all these villages and bring the hopes and aspirations of the people there to the entire country.
That is why the biggest benefit is that all the government employees who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach out to the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women
Whatever government has worked, which government has not worked, there is no need to reach out to them, what they need to reach is not deprived of what they can afford.
They must be informed about their rights.
We must strive to ensure that the efficient and good messages of the common man are delivered to a large number of people.
It's a kind of service.
I've made a little effort to do this like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
You should join this effort like yourself.
I would like to reach out to 125 crore Indians, this is not possible without your help.
Come, let us collectively inspire the common people by encouraging them to share the goodwill and right of the common man.
My dear young friends, from the Red Fort on 15th August, I have started the Start Up India, Stand Up I.
Since then, it has spread to every department of the government that India can become a start-up capital.
New thoughts and new strategies are desirable because the world cannot move ahead without new innovation.
In every corner of India, there are talented young friends who need only opportunities.
We will take this project forward with the request of all the state governments.
On 16th January, I will meet you and discuss in detail and wait for your advice.
There are millions of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 1992 to 12 January 1991.
The festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January, 2018 at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some suggestions about this youth
My special request to the young friends is to send your suggestions directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want him to know what you feel.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give appropriate advice and information to my government.
Friends, I have waited for your views on the youth festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Dileep Chouhan, the visually impaired teacher of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
I have received a very encouraging response from the students and inspired them to help the physically challenged in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dileep ji, thank you very much.
You're doing it yourself.
You are well aware of their problems and you must have faced many problems yourself.
When there is an opportunity to interact with such people in the society, I have a lot of feelings.
We express our vision for their problems as per our thoughts.
Some people are victims of an accident.
Some people are born with physical disabilities.
Various words are used to identify all these persons and these words are being talked about.
But it always seems that the use of such words for these people is not right, not respectable.
There's a special significance of the word.
This year, the Government of India has started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present on that occasion, I was thinking about it.
During this period, I feel that God has given some incompleteness to the body or one organ of which does not function properly, we call him handicapped, we know him handicapped.
But sometimes when I meet them, I understand that in our eyes, there is some incompleteness in that person, but God has given him some extra power.
These are the people who have one or more organs, which have divine power, which are not in the body of ordinary people like us.
I like this song.
I appeal to the countrymen, can we use the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
On that day we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
We will strive to facilitate physical and virtual infrastructure for Divyangjans.
We need a lot of things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, sloping roads or ramps at railway stations, easy parking and lifting, braille library etc.
In our country gas cylinders are provided.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan Account, Aadhaar Card etc, the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (LDBT) will directly reach the bank accounts of the beneficiary.
I am proud to inform the country that it has been ranked as the Guinness Book of World Records for successfully launching the biggest Direct Benefit Scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been very successful.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPGs have been benefitted through the Pahal Yojana.
Nowadays, the MNREGA scheme ensures the livelihood of the rural people.
There have been several complaints regarding the financing of the scheme.
Now most of the money is being directly transferred to the bank accounts of the workers.
There was a lot of problem with the students' scholarships, there were many complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will be gradually taken forward.
About 40,000 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiaries bank accounts under various schemes.
Approximately 35 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).
My dear countrymen, 26th January is Republic Day.
It is a matter of happiness that this year marks the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of the Constitution.
It was a very good experience that the session of the Parliament was specifically scheduled two days to discuss the Constitution.
The Constitution also lays emphasis on duties.
There is a lot of duties while voting, but why shouldn't there be any duties everyday
This year, when we observe the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, what cannot we organise, debate and poetry competitions in schools, colleges, villages, cities and social organisations
Before 26th January, you can write a poem on duty in your mother tongue or English or Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
You can send it to my gov portal.
I am very keen to know about the responsibility of the youth of our country.
I want to make a small offer.
On 26th January, when we observe Republic Day, cant we take care of the citizens and school-children of our country to clean and clean the images of the great men founded in our cities and to maintain the cleanliness of the iconic sector
I'm not talking about government.
As ordinary citizens, we are as desperate to preserve the emotions and zeal of these great men.
Can't we make it a normal habit for the society, for the country
On 26th January, let us all work together for the cleanliness of all these idols that have been constructed in the honour of the great men.
For this, the common man, the citizens have to come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to all of you for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and employment generation will also start with new zeal.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas must have begun.
Festivals have a distinct significance in society.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates new zeal.
But sometimes whenever there is a crisis in the festival, it becomes very painful.
There are reports of natural disasters everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural disasters that have never heard or thought before.
I convey my condolences and condolences to all these families in this hour of grief.
The State Government uses utmost force in rescue and rescue operations.
The government is working shoulder to shoulder at all times in the central government.
At present, a team rescued by the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to move forward at a rapid pace in the new era and will continue to play the role played by him in taking the country forward.
When these dangers are happening around, the necessity to prevent them is also increasing.
Now her form has changed.
In every case, the excellence of its capacity building has become very important.
The government, the diverse society, the people, even the smaller organisations have to work in a scientific manner for the Capacity Building.
I am happy to note that this initiative has been launched through a table talk exercise and best programme seminar and workshop in Delhi.
You are well aware of the problems faced by the farmers not only by the biotechnology but also by the farmers.
It is our nature and generation that has been working to burn the roots of our crops.
Firstly, there was no concept of harm that could have been caused by it - all of us are doing it.
Secondly, there was no training on what other methods could be.
When the impact of these dangers began to fall on the city, people would be moved against it.
The sorrow you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to provide proper training to our farmer brothers and sisters.
If we burn the roots of the crops then the time will be saved, the hard work will be saved, the fields will be ready for the next crop but it is not right.
The root of the crop is very precious.
It's a biological fertilizer.
We're burning the pots and destroying it.
It's not the end, if these roots are squeezed, it can be cattle feed.
To burn this root, the upper layer of agriculture is burning.
The upper layer of our land is burnt to death by our fertiles.
And that's why we have to play a viable role.
Mix the root of this crop on the ground, it'll be cured.
If the biological fertilizer is used in that land, it can be doubled.
Once I had the opportunity to interact with the artists.
They talked about a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas, they used to spend five thousand, sometimes ten or fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean the roots of bananas.
If we hadn't got a tracker to clean it, the heels would have fallen like that.
Some farmers had pieces of six or eight inches of measurement to bury them on the ground.
Because there is so much water on the root of that banana plant that if there is any tree, tree or crop there is no need to give water separately for three months.
The water that is on the root of banana keeps the crops alive.
Those who used to spend their money for cleaning their roots, now their income is coming from them.
Our farmer brothers and sisters are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on the 3rd of December, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Divyangjan.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about organ donations.
I also talked about the helpline of NOTO for organ donation.
On 27th November, 2019, the National Organ Donation Day was celebrated.
Chitravinetri Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries from the society were present on the occasion.
Organ donation can save a lot of precious life.
It can bring immortality in a way.
When a part of the body is transformed from one body to another, it leads to a new life and it also leads to a new life.
What could be greater than this
A national level competition was organized through Mygov. in portal to create a slogan on the Logo, Donor Cards and Notories.
People with physical and mental disabilities have immense courage and talent.
But if we change our vision, change our attitude towards them then they can become the inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying when we're in small trouble.
That's why they are the source of our inspiration.
I salute their determination, energy, ways of fighting their lives and the indomitable effort to make them stronger.
I want to talk about Javed Ahmas today.
Some parts of the kidneys, microscopics and respiratory tract were to be fired by the terrorists.
There was a serious injury in the backbone.
The ability to stand on his feet ended up like he was, but Javed didn't mean to be.
The attack on the terrorists couldn't trigger him.
An innocent person is thus inflicted with life-threatening consequences, yet without expressing any anger or anguish, Javed Ahmad dealt with these dangers with sympathy.
This is his greatest mental strength and he has served the society.
He is not always empowered, but for the last 20 years he has been engaged in teaching children.
He has done MA in social science and as a social worker and aware citizen, he is making a quiet revolution today as an angel of disabilities.
Can people from every corner of India get inspiration from the story of Javed
On 3rd December, I will commemorate the life, penance and self-employment of Javed Ahmad.
Over time, I am talking about Javed but I know that every corner of India is a flame of inspiration that brings new light to life and guides new paths.
3rd December is the day to remind all such inspirational people.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things that depend on the government of the people.
The government and the government have regular links with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the Dalit, the afflicted, the deprived and the underprivileged.
Our country has a network of hope workers.
They have done many social work in India.
There's an outbreak of malaria.
Yamuna Monising, a hopeful worker from this village, has decided that no one in his own village will be allowed to die of malaria.
If there is a small fever in the village, then reach that house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of preliminary treatment taught him.
Emphasizing the use of pesticides in every household.
Just like sleeping and taking care of your child, this hope-serving worker Yamuna Monising completely dedicated himself to protecting the entire village from mosquitoes and made all the villages to prevent malaria.
How many such Yamuna monisings are there
We have lakhs of people around us.
We're gonna try to see them respectfully.
These can become the biggest strength of the country.
We are all friends of happiness and sorrow.
I salute all the hope-makers through Yamuna Monising.
Firstly, on the issue of Swachh Bharat, the second is related to 'Adarsh Gram Parishad' and the third is health matters.
I request you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
It may seem like adding something to you.
Then you must send me to mygov portal.
There are many such events that do not come to our notice but are the real power for the society.
The right example is our greatest strength.
I call upon you to join in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
World Warming and Climate Change is now the most light and thoughtful and it is being recognized as an indicator before doing everything.
The temperature of the world should not rise and it should be the concern and responsibility of all.
The first way to avoid the rise in temperature is energy conservation.
Once I had said that the entire moon should be bathed in full moonlight for hours by shutting down the street lights.
You should feel that moon ray.
A friend sent me a link to such a scene and I had a chance to see him.
A woman named Nurjahan of Kanpur, who is unable to see on TV, has got a lot of opportunity to study, has done something that perhaps no one has ever thought about.
He has been working with solar energy to provide electricity to the poor.
He is fighting darkness and brightening his name.
People take the lanterns in the evening, go back to charge in the morning.
Approximately three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
The Nurjahan recharged these ladders with solar energy all day.
Look, the big people of the world are doing a lot of things for climate change, but one Nirvanajan seems to inspire all of them.
In the same way, the name of Nurjahan is to illuminate the world.
Similarly, he is also spreading light.
Congratulations to Honble Prime Minister that he has started a scheme on Mudra Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is fund the unfunded.
The speed at which I want to move is still the same.
Most of the aid beneficiaries are Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, who are working hard on their own and are working with dignity.
Abhishek promised to encourage himself.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
There's someone called me Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received a loan of Rs. 8.
And he's starting to finish the piece of safai.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that this campaign will create new entrepreneurs.
And the gentleman did it on the oven.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want more publicity of this scheme.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businesses.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
People employed in small jobs are the real power of the economy of the country.
We want to focus on it.
Well done, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our society.
Internal Vigilance is the Prize for Liberty will be the prize for internal security.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, we have to deploy the river of internal security.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat - I would like to make it a plan, and I had also asked the portals to give an idea.
I've been told there's a lot of suggestions.
I have been told that the participants will be given certificates.
Big prizes have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season is starting.
It's a good time to eat and wear different dresses.
Well, I'll tell you, exercise.
At least one hour of your family members should be together, you will see how awareness will be generated about this and how fresh it will be for the whole day.
Make good habits in good weather.
Joy Hind
My dear countrymen, Greetings to all of you
This is the twelfth episode of Mann Ki Baat, and it has crossed a year to see this.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of speaking in Mann Ki Baat.
Democracy has an unprecedented magnificence of manpower.
I have a fundamental thought in my life and that is why I have unwavering faith in the peoples power.
From what Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have understood, what I have experienced, I can say that the power of the people is greater than what we thought.
Our ancestors have said that they are a part of God.
I can say from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have immense power and immense truth because I have realized it.
I have asked everyone for advice on Mann Ki Baat but perhaps I have been able to see or understand two suggestions every time.
But lakhs of people are actively advising me.
It's a big power on its own.
And this is how Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing his thoughts to the society.
Once I talked about selfy with daughter.
And so the whole world was amazed.
But lakhs of selfy with daughters have come from all over the world and daughters have become proud of it.
And when they took selfy with daughter, they did not only honour their daughters, they also raised a resolve within themselves.
And when the others see these selfies, each one of them feels that they have to leave their indifference to their daughters.
People from every nook and corner of India have sent such pictures to lakhs of people.
The state government or the tourism department of the central government could not imagine that there are so many valuable resources in our country.
Little, we're buying khadi.
Today, I can say with great joy that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any government advertisements.
We didn't have to spend crores of rupees.
This was a belief of the people's power, a feeling.
I had requested the financially prosperous people to extradite the subsidy for gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, a retired teacher, standing in line with the gifts of gas cylinders.
The middle class, lower-middle class families of the society, who are very uncomfortable with giving up subsidy, have also given up their beneficiaries.
Isn't that a fucking revolution
The more the government works with the people, the more it works with the betterment of the society, the better it is.
The people of my country are trying to consolidate themselves for the welfare of the country by giving importance to every small word.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new initiative.
Whether it is Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumarika India, there is no place where people have not called.
It's a feeling of my own.
People of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
They have given full positive suggestions.
Look, the people of the country have a very positive attitude and this is a huge resource for the country.
Perhaps there was a serious complaint on one or two phones.
One more thing is that we have received a lot of calls from specially handicapped persons, especially the visually impaired persons.
One of the reasons is that since they don't have the luck to watch TV, they must listen to the radio.
With this, I have understood how important the radio is for the visually impaired.
I have got a new direction from these phones and these phones are extremely important for making the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar, Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and the people of the whole country should accept it.
Listen to what he wants to say: "My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that this suggestion of yours will spread across the corner of India in the spirit of air.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
I have spent my time with the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force and Navy personnel who have provided water, land and air.
What was not there - the entire history was brought alive.
The glorious moments of the war, we have heard of the indomitable courage and sacrifices of our army, we have achieved through this exhibition because we have not received any pictures of that time and videography was not possible.
Whether it is the battle of Haji Peer or the battle of the north of the country, the battle of Chaminder or the victory of Haji Peer Pass, whatever it is, it is a thrilling experience and it is a pride for our soldiers.
This exhibition will last for a while.
My request is that those who are around Delhi, you must see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a young boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but that young boy has forgotten his name in a hurry.
We should make Swachhata natural and take appropriate measures for it.
I have to hear a lot of things that Modi ji had spoken a lot about cleanliness but what is happening at the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, both the Parliament and the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
The movement that has been created with cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred towards garbage, the awareness about cleanliness will also make this government work for making a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Bodies namely, Panchayats, Municipal Corporations, Municipal Corporations or States or Union Territories have to work in this regard.
And when we will be celebrating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move forward in the right direction to fulfil the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once Mahatma Gandhi had said that if I have to like one of these two things, freedom and transparency, then I will first like cleanliness, after independence.
Gandhiji was more important than freedom.
Come, let us follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfill his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the life philosophy of the great men is a source of inspiration for us.
Any day is historically linked to the name of some great man.
In the days to come, we will remember all these great men, we will take their philosophy to every household and we will try to learn something from it.
I would particularly like to mention on 2nd October that day, the birthday of revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different types of fabrics, different types of fabrics, many other types of items, but Khadi's goods should have a special place.
And that is why in this Deepawali, we will give space to our homes, we will wear clothing.
And look, the sale of cloth doubled last time.
How many poor people have benefited.
The government cannot afford to spend lakhs of crores of rupees through advertising.
This is Jan Shakti and that is why I once again request you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I wish you all the very best.
I went to Kolkata in May, some of the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose had come to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
There was a lot of opportunity to spend some time with the family members of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how enjoyable it is for me.
Perhaps they are coming together for the first time in the Prime Minister's residence.
But it is a matter of great pleasure for me that I have never had the opportunity to have such a hospitality in the house of the Prime Minister in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhas Babu, who live in different countries, are coming.
He sent me a message from Vargavi Kande, to hear his voice, I thought he was going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make the youth aware of the registration of voters, which will increase the participation of youth in the coming days, and make the youth an important partner in the formation and operation of the Government in the future.
Thank you for registering and voting on the electoral rolls.
Every voter in the democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
Even a few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission used to conduct elections but in the last few years there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an election candidate, it is an assistive work, it has become a voter-friendly and all their thoughts and plans are at the centre of the poll.
But only the Election Commission will work, it will not work.
I hope that if the youngsters of the country do not register their names on the electoral roll, they will surely register and vote.
On the day of election, I will openly say, Polling first, then drinking water.
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
Last time I came to Kashi.
I have met several people, several programmes have been held, many have met but I would like to tell you about two children.
But his interest in physics at such a young age surprised me.
I think he does a lot of studies, internet surfing, and new uses of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of rail accidents, what kind of technology is needed, how to reduce energy costs, how to experience robots etc.
One such person has met a small sandstone called Sonampatel.
Sonam is nine years old.
I was surprised that the whole Geetha was a woman's voice, but the most important thing is, when I asked her, she was arguing in English as a shloka, explaining the shloka, analysing in Hindi as well.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since she was five years old.
I asked him about his studies, did he read Geetha or did anything else
The gentleman said, "No, if Sonam once started screaming and reading in the evening, and if history is there, he's in the middle of the evening."
They're astonished with her, she's the only one in her family.
I'm really amazed.
Sometimes there's a hobby of celebrity among kids, and there's nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given it a special power.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
I have to make a lot of effort to do this once a month.
Sometimes our friends of the Akashwani have to wait for an hour or two for me.
One year of Mann Ki Baat programme was completed.
Do you know how useful Subhas Babu used radio
He started his radio broadcast from Germany and through radio he used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pusti, Aurobindo etc.
I would like to listen to you people, think about your suggestions, and that is why my thoughts are unfolding, which reach you through the Akashvaani.
I say, but it's all about you, and that's my satisfaction.
Once again, I have got the opportunity to be with you people in Mann Ki Baat.
The people of far-flung South India are now celebrating the Onam Festival and the whole nation celebrated the holy Rakhibandhan Festival yesterday.
Government of India has started several new schemes, including social security, for the common man.
I am glad that many people have come under these schemes in a short span of time.
I had made a small request that our sisters should be given such a safety scheme in the Raksha Bandhan festival.
I have received plenty of information that shows that eleven crore families have been associated with the scheme since its inception.
I have also been told that half of the benefits have been received by the mothers and sisters.
Today, when I was talking to you, a year ago, the 'Jan Dhan Yojana' was launched.
There was a lot of questions that the work that was not done in sixty years would happen in such a short span of time
This has helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy Camps have been opened to bring together the banking sector, the economy and the downtrodden.
This is the belief that the poorest of the poor can get the money from the bank.
I once again express my gratitude to all those associated with it and also to those poor brothers and sisters who have opened their accounts in the bank.
This bank is yours, you will not leave it anymore.
I've given it to you, it's your responsibility to keep it.
We have to keep all accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you will keep it.
A few days ago, the violent incidents of Gujarat had disturbed the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the whole country feels sad.
But in a very short span of time, my brothers and sisters of Gujarat took care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation from getting worse and Gujarat has again taken the path of peace.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood is the path that we have to work shoulder to shoulder for the betterment and progress.
Prosperity is the solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the people of Sufi Dharma.
I am telling the truth that this experience of listening to their great words has brought a musical experience in my ears.
The words of those scholars, the words of them, the calm generosity that lies in the Sufi dharma, have come to my perception as a musical fountain.
I liked it so much.
Perhaps this true form of Islam is the most needed to reach the world of copper.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that it will benefit the entire humanity and Islam.
I would like to say to others, we are a community but we need to understand the spirit of Sufi.
I am going to have another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate to receive this invitation.
Students from Buddhist religions from all over the world are coming to India and will discuss various issues related to mankind all over the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Buddha.
This is a moment of great pleasure for me to meet all these odds of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to talk to you people especially.
I have already talked about this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You have heard about it in the Parliament, in the Lok Sabha or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mind is open on the issue of disputes related to land acquisition laws.
I have agreed to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I would like to tell the farmers that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that a lot of misconceptions have been spread about this and farmers are scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never be misunderstood and they will never be afraid.
I don't want anybody to misunderstand or scare anybody.
Every claim of the country is required by me, but the farmers claim is most important among them.
I've decided to end this term.
That is, the position before my government was formed has come back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 such things which had to be completed in a year and we brought them in the Ordinance, but due to this dispute, that too was incomplete.
We are the mantra of the welfare of the poor and the farmers in the villages.
Therefore, I had said on 15th August that not only the Agriculture Department but also the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department will be set up.
We are trying to transform this decision quickly.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason to be confused anymore.
Don't be afraid if anyone tries to scare you.
I've got one more thing to say.
Two days ago, the war in 1947 was completed 50 years.
Whenever there is talk of the war of Turkey, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also natural to remember the Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra.
It is also natural to remember the sacrifices made by all those who have sacrificed their lives for the pride and honour of the tri-national flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the 65th India Victory and salute the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us.
I am very happy that India is doing a great job in many fields of science.
Our scientists are really doing a great job.
I have seen how young scientists are talking with enthusiasm, I have dreamt of new dreams in their eyes.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I feel that there is a lot of opportunities in this field.
I am glad that within fifteen days, the government has started working on this thing in a short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and it is expected that interviews for small jobs will be disposed off soon.
Today, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
In order to reduce health, especially mother and child deaths, 24 countries of the world have come together and agreed on India's Call to Action Plan.
This is the first time in any other country outside the United States.
It is true that even today, about 50,000 mothers and about 3 lakh children die every year during or after childbirth.
It's too thoughtful and fearful.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, Indias appreciation has started at the international level, yet this number is not less than deficit.
Just as we got rid of polio, we got rid of death due to tetanus of mothers and children.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and newborns.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting very news today.
It's true that dengue is dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It is directly linked to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
We watch advertising on dengue, advertising on news papers, but we don't mind.
Cleaning the small things in the house, keeping the water clean.
People's education has started in a big way, but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes I feel that we live in a very clean house, a very good arrangement, but I don't think that I am inviting dengue to the water that is frozen in my house.
I urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is precious.
It's not okay that the apathy towards dirty water around will be a cause of death.
Approximately 514 centres across the country have access to dengue tests at nominal cost.
Examining time is very important to keep death in check.
I wish you all the very best in this regard.
Cleanliness needs to be emphasized.
Now there will be several festivals from Rakhibandhan to Deepawali across the country.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to share a happy news.
I often say that it is not a privilege to donate life for our country but it is a privilege to save our country.
Two young men of my country, two brothers from Nasik, Maharashtra, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced India's pride.
America has a bicycle race, Race Across America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am very happy to note that these two brothers have succeeded in the mission of "Team India Vision for Tribals".
See how everybody is trying to take the country forward at a personal level.
When I hear these things, I feel proud.
Sometimes we commit injustice to the new generation by following the old thinking.
Old generations believe that new generations don't know anything, these ideas have been going on for centuries.
I have met many youngsters who have made the Sunday on Cycle their lives.
Some people say that I celebrate Cycle Day a week.
It is also very useful for protecting my body and environment.
And I like to think about the young man I am.
Cycling is now being carried out in many cities of our country and there is a lot of people who are encouraging us to ride a bike.
It is a good endeavor for environment protection and health improvement.
I am glad to mention the way the thoughts and thoughts of the youth of India are going on when both the youngsters of my country have raised the national flag in America today.
I would like to especially congratulate the Maharashtra government today.
The construction of the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar was stuck in the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai for a long time.
With this, we have bought 10 houses of King Henry Road in London where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar used to live.
The Maharashtra government will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for the Indians who roam around the world.
I salute the efforts of the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud of them.
It's good to start this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helped in harvesting crops.
And it is a pleasure to remind me of a pleasure.
Our country has huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds.
I want the pulses of the poor, I want some oil to prepare a string for food.
I am happy to note that this time the pulses have grown by nearly 50 and oilseeds have grown by about 33.
My dear countrymen, 26th July has been marked as the Kargil Vijay Diwas in our countrys history.
The farmers have a close relationship with the land and the soldiers of our country.
The war in Kargil was not just on the borders of the country, every city of India, every village of India was associated with this war.
This war was fought by all the mothers and sisters who fought against the enemies in Kargil.
Today, India has been able to talk to the world about the sacrifices made by them.
I am glad that almost two crore people have seen the MyGov portal just after one year.
Why can't we preserve for persons with disabilities while booking train tickets through the website of RCTC
Now it's a very small thing, but it's never been considered by the government or discussed.
Brothers and sisters, today this system has been started for our disabled brothers and sisters.
The logo that is being prepared today, the tag lines are being constructed, the plans are being formulated, the policies are being formulated on the MyGov portal.
There is a feeling of a new clean air in the governance system.
I feel a new consciousness.
There are several suggestions in the MyGov portal for what I should say on 15th August.
From Chennai, the supernatural Raghavchari sent a lot of opinions.
You can send it to MyGov portal, write letters in Akashwani and write letters to the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I'm a good thing in Mani that on 15th August, I got a suggestion from the public for my address.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi, and after the accident, a scooter driver has been screaming for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, you feel painful.
There was an accident every minute in our country.
For the accident, one death occurred every 4 minutes for road accidents.
And most importantly, one-third of all these dead men is the young man between the ages of 15 and 25 years, and one death can destroy the entire family.
They will do whatever the administration should do, but I would like to request my parents that your children should be clever or fore-wheeler, all efforts should be made on the side of the family for caution.
Sometimes I see it, it is written behind the auto rickshaw, "Papa hurricane come back to the house".
And that is why I say that the government has taken a number of new initiatives in this regard - be it education on road safety or be it construction of roads, administrative arrangements or be it the immediate treatment of the injured persons after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
In the coming days, I would like to think about taking some important steps for the use of National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
I have also taken up another scheme which will cover all the highways of the country including Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangagram and Mondia.
I am thinking of a cashless treatment system for the first fifty hours after the accident: Whether the injured person has money or not, who will not pay the money, how the injured person gets good health care and gets first aid.
All over the country, I have arranged a toll-free number 1033, an ambulance, but this is the next step of the accident.
Sometimes I say that employees are employed.
I would like to tell you that in the last few days some incidents have come to my notice, which I like.
Victory Bishwal has shown how to connect his interests, his industry and his capabilities with his work.
There may be discussions and discussions on the photos of Vijay Bishwal in the coming days.
I am reminded of one more thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started a work in the entire district which touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken the responsibility of providing toilets to their sisters during the Rakhibandhan festival so that no mothers and sisters of the entire district do not have to go for toilets in the open.
I came to know about this kind of news that I want to share with you people.
There is a small village named Keshla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilets for the past few months.
Now no person in this village has to defecate in open space.
After the completion of toilets, people from all over the village celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an example of how the values of the society are changing, the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are moving forward.
I have written to you about North-East India, Bhavesh Deka of Guwahati, however, very active in the work of the people of North-East India.
They keep writing a lot - it's a good thing.
I am happy to tell them that there is a separate Ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate ministry called Development of North East Region (DoNER).
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department has taken a very important decision that the development of Northeast India cannot be achieved by sitting in Delhi.
Together they decided that a team of officers from the Government of India will visit the states of North-Eastern India such as Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and remain camped for seven days.
We need to move forward from Delhi to the East, which I call Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, we are delighted in the success of the Merce Mission and are also proud of us.
In the last few days, we successfully launched five satellites from the PSLV C28 United Kingdom.
All these news come for a few minutes and leave again.
We don't remember these usually.
But sometimes I think that today when we talk to the younger generation and ask them what they want to be in the future, there are about one hundred students who say, I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Exploration Campaign to explore new talent.
Now we have to go to another village to charge our mobile phones.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll finish it.
I've started it, I'll finish it.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
Several festivals are also celebrated.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Send your suggestions for August 15th.
Your opinions will help me a lot.
Thank you very much
When I told you, I didn't think I'd get a remarkable response.
Millions of people posted photos on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I have seen a photograph of how many diversities are there in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, oceans
I believe that the government of India has not been able to imagine this thing for tourism.
I liked some more pictures that I re-touched myself.
I believe that if we did not post the photo of the Belum cave in Andhra Pradesh, we would not have been able to know the place that was hidden in our country.
But the scene we saw on 21st June is very strange, I believe that wherever the sun rays have reached, there was no country where the sun was not welcomed by yoga exercises.
I can assert that the sun does not settle in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Yoga has been honoured and sacrificed by the people of the world.
I am also very happy.
The heart is filled with happiness, the Sin River and the Eiffel Tower are the symbols of pride for the people of France, and they liked the place for Yoga and showed equal respect to Yoga as well.
People have joined the Times Square in New York.
When we talk of Australian Sydney, the Opera House flashes in front of our eyes.
The Australian citizens have performed yoga at Opera House, have shown Yoga the same respect as the Opera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Dumo Cathedral of Milan, Yoga has made us proud everywhere.
On 21st June, when Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, performed Yoga at the head of the United Nations, I was very happy.
Similarly, the UN Peacekeepers have performed very well.
In Siachen of India, our army has deployed white ice sheets, and the Navy has participated in the Yoga programme wherever our boats were there.
In Delhi, Yoga has placed itself in the Guinnessbook of World Records.
It seems that everywhere in the world, a new joy, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit has emerged.
Just a few days ago, when I visited a small Vietnamese family in a tour of Vietnam, the photo was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Whether it is men or women, children, villages or cities or developing countries, all of them are associated with Yoga.
Yoga has truly bound the whole world together.
I don't know how odds and wicked people will see this thing but I feel one thing, every Indian can proud that the whole world is eager to know India.
Everyone's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know Indias values, traditions and heritage.
Our responsibility is to leave this heritage unprecedented and leave it to everyone.
We can do this if we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes something is so much known to us that we don't see any innovation in them like our family values, we don't know that our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why shouldn't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be amazed, I firmly believe that there are many such topics that the ancestors have given us.
The success, joy and satisfaction of International Day of Yoga has brought a new responsibility.
It is our responsibility to provide good Yoga to the world.
I believe that you can create a database on where to learn yoga and where to find Yoga teachers.
We have seen the results of the governments very active and determined goals.
When there was despair around us, as we used to hear a year ago, nothing would happen - nothing would happen - nothing would happen.
There is a department of the government Ayush.
Nobody gave any importance to this
However, on the occasion of Yoga Day, this small portfolio has led and organized such a big event all over the world.
If the target is fixed, the small departments can also do well, it is a sample of that.
A few days ago, the world saw how our people protected people from Yemen.
Within a few hours, Indians have moved ahead to help Nepal.
If the government is active, the employees of all the banks come forward to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank and within a few days crores of people are connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I had requested to construct toilets in all the schools in the Red Fort and I had said that by 15th August we will have to complete this work.
The work that was not completed in sixty years was a great bravery.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees, everybody wants to work for the country.
Last month, I had launched three public safety schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the Jan Suraksha Yojana, although we have to take this project forward.
Festival of Rakshabandhan is coming in the month of August.
Can't we together build a strong Jan Andolan before this festival and facilitate the mothers and sisters of our country's public safety scheme
On Rakhibandhan, this may be a great gift for the sister before Bhai.
When I come to Mann Ki Baat, many people send me suggestions.
Many people have suggested that I should talk about rain.
From Nagpur to Yogesh Dandekar, from Mysore to Harsh Vardhan Mahasay, Praveen Nadkarni Mahasay, Divyaansu Gupta Mahasya, everyone told me to talk about the rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season gives a lot of pleasure to the mind.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You must have enjoyed the use of hot tea in this rainy season with hot pakora, bhajabhuji and bhutta.
As the sun rays give us energy, the rains give us strength.
Point water is very valuable.
As a citizen, as a society, we have to develop a habit of saving water.
We should make a solemn pledge that the water of the village will remain in the village, the water of the city should be in the city.
Ren water harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Whatever the small ponds of the field, we have to save the drops of water.
This poorbandar was on the seashore, so rain water was collected for sweet water and kept at home.
At that time, so much efforts were made to save rain water.
We can do the same.
And I would like to make a suggestion from my direct and successful experience.
It's a complete rural technology.
When you plant a tree, put an old soil club near the tree and fill it with water.
Water will be filled once or twice a month.
You will see that this tree will grow very fast and become very strong.
I would also like to tell the farmers that you should plant trees without roaming around your fields.
And we also know that in the rainy season, the diseases spread more through water.
Bacteria activate to increase moisture in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is very important at this time.
You should drink pure drinking water at this time.
It's right, we're gonna be as far away as we're gonna be careful.
I want water, I want rain, but I also want to prevent diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently launched three new projects, especially for the citizens.
There are at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to stay in this house to study in schools for electricity, drinking water, toilets and nearby children.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give every country its own home.
I have been associated with all of you through social media.
I get new ideas, suggestions from you people, I get good ideas about the government's work.
But when this government scheme becomes its own scheme of individuals, societies or villages then its strength increases.
On the last day, Shriman Sunil Jaglan Mahashay, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village in Haryana, has started a very funny effort.
And this creates an environment where every father takes selfie with his daughter and posts on social media.
In Harian, the number of sands is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation that is very thoughtful.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that is why I urge you all to participate in the Selfie With Daughter with your daughters.
In order to further strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write a tagline, write beautiful taglines in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will take it with your daughter and re-touch your selfies.
In a way, we can transform the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme into a mass movement.
Make our country cosmetic.
I am telling you from my experience that this effort should be taken forward.
Make this part of your life.
And one more thing - Incredible India - wherever you don't go, you must send a picture there.
Our country will be able to know about the diversity of our country.
I feel that the photographs that you are sending are very few in handicrafts.
You can also post pictures of handicrafts in your area in Incredible India.
There is a lot of things in your city - the poor people also produce many things.
And we have a simple medium so that we can reach.
My dear countrymen, that's all.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be interacting with you.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to announce a big scheme of the government but not that.
I'm working day and night.
Through this programme, I am talking to you lightly and bitterly.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Imagine what this time is.
When I used to talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that the words were mine, the voice of the throat was mine, but the words were mortal, you people were mortal, you people were miraculous.
But this Sunday I've waited a lot.
Well, there's a chance.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat i. e.
This momentous interaction with you people was a part of my spiritual journey.
Several people asked me why I went to Kedarnath in that busy vote.
You have the right and I can understand your curiosity.
I guess I've ever told you about the circumstances of my time.
But today I feel that if I talk about those things then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Voting is busy, estimation of defeat and polling is still there when I got out.
Most people found it politically.
But for me, it was an opportunity to interact with myself.
I could tell you I was going to meet me.
I don't know when I can tell you, but I'm sure you have your right over me.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have always felt a positive force in your endeavor.
Sometimes some of your words make my thought sharper.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people in the country and the society as well as the immediate solutions.
I have noticed that there is a description of the problem in the letter, but there is a special feature in it that some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
If anyone writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anguish over dirt and welcomes this effort towards cleanliness.
Whenever someone talks about the environment, he feels a lot about pollution and also talks about his own efforts.
He also spoke of the ways being adopted, and said that the imagination that he imagines is to prevent environmental pollution.
That is, I can see a glimpse of how this problem can be solved by taking the entire society together.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror to the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of inner strength, capability and talent among the people of the country.
It is only necessary to harness the strength and talent in the right way, to give them an opportunity.
Mann Ki Baat Ao tells us that the strength and activity of the 130 crore countrymen must be linked to the progress of the country.
I must say one more thing that in Mann Ki Baat, I have a lot of letters, a lot of phone calls, a lot of messages, but there are very few complaints.
You can imagine that nobody is writing letters to the Prime Minister of the country but asking for something for himself
This is a symbol of the high thinking of millions of people across the country.
My heart is full of happiness today.
And that is why I easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will return to you.
Let us take this idea forward to the continuity of Mann Ki Baat.
When emergency came into force in the country, the movement against it was not limited to political circles, political leaders or prisons.
We don't feel hungry when we eat dinner and dinner.
Similarly, in everyday life, the importance of the right of republic is felt only when the right is undermined.
And this is not because the Indian Constitution took some such steps to promote democracy.
There is a need for constitution and legislation to drive the society system smoothly.
And that is why the country had dedicated to the entire election, not for itself but for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the biggest electoral process of democracy has emerged in our country, where the poorest of the poor, all of them have joined this campaign to decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we cannot understand its importance
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, Sixty One Crore
The number may seem to be a bit small, but if we look around the world then I will say that more than a population of any country in the world has voted in India without a single china.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of the United States.
The total number of electors in India is more than the population of Europe.
These are the administrators of the vastness and enormity of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election is still the worlds largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine what kind of events and human resources are required to complete this process.
This election has been made possible for the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
On the one hand, about three lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces have discharged their responsibilities to fulfil this magnificence of democracy and twenty lakh police personnel of different states have worked tirelessly.
As a result of these hard work, this time more votes were cast than last election.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are being provided in this election process.
To ensure that no one remains deprived of the right to vote.
Polling stations were created for only one female electorate in a remote place in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel in that place for two days.
That's the true honor of democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is one more information that we can take pride in.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also voted enthusiastically like men.
The number of male and female electors is approximately equal in this election.
Inspiring information is now a record of 78 women MPs in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the voting process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, many times you will be listening to me not Bouquet but Book.
My wish was to use the habits if books could be given instead of flowers
Another story that deepens my heart is Eidgah.
The story is a boy's sympathy, a pure love for his grandmother.
When the four-five-year-old Hamid takes a pinch from the fair to his grandmother, it seems that the love of the human mind, the love of compassion, what a wonderful one can be.
The last line of this story is an unforgettable truth in our thoughts and teachings. "Shish Hamid played the role of the elderly Hamid.
A very interesting story like this is 'Pus Ki Rat'.
This story shows a vibrant picture of the life of a poor farmer.
The farmers are very happy even after their crops have been wasted because they do not have to sleep in the fields during winters.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, yet their relevance still remains the same.
After reading the story, I feel another kind of feeling.
When books are about to be read, I read about Kerala's letters library.
You will be surprised to know that the library is located in a village in the deep forest of Idukki.
A primary school teacher, P.
V. Chinnathampi had done extraordinary work for this library.
There was a time when books were put on the back, filled with bags.
Today this library is showing a new dimension along with tribal children.
Gujarat's Wangchu Gujarat campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people of all ages participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, in the times of the Guru, I would like to urge you people to take some time out and put some space in your Daily Routine.
You will really enjoy it and you must write on the NarendraModiApp about the books you read so that all the audiences of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not just present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModiApp and MyGov, I noticed that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shah Altaf and many others have written about water related issues.
Water has a very big impact in our culture.
Up to Rikveda: It is said about water that Apo Hishtha Myo Bhubah is no Urje Dadhata, he is supposed to be in the battle.
Many parts of the country are being damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in a year only 8 of the water received from the rains is conserved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that we will find solutions to this problem as well as through other problems, through peoples participation, with the strength of the people, with the capabilities, cooperation and resolve of 130 crore people.
New Jal Shakti Ministries have been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will facilitate quick decision-making of all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to innovate something different.
I wrote letters to all the village heads of the country.
I had written to the village heads to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to hold a meeting of the Gram Sabha, to sit with the villagers and perform toilets.
I am glad that they have shown full enthusiasm for this thing and on 22nd May crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People have resolved to save one drop of water in the village.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to recite the message of Gram Panchayat.
My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, the Panchayat chief of Lupung village of Katakamashandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, when Prime Minister wrote our letters to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote our letters.
Once again the people of that place are ready to play their role in water conservation.
On behalf of me, I convey my best wishes to all the village heads, all the heads of the Panchayats for their activeness.
There are several panchayat heads in the country who have been involved in water conservation.
Whatever I said, it is possible for everyone to get a positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is to save water, water conservation.
Water drainage reforms are underway in Punjab.
This will help in reducing the problem of water conservation.
The construction of a reservoir at Themayipalli in Telangana has changed the lives of the people of the village.
The construction of small ponds built in the fields of poetry in Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I was reading a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women were in one place to revive the river.
I was also reading about those women from Garhwal who have been working very well to keep the rain water intact.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, three requests are being made to the countrymen.
My first request is that as the countrymen gave cleanliness a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we resolve to save every drop of water, I believe that water is a prasad from Parameswar, water is a pilgrimage.
Let us begin an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Be it the world of cinema, the world of sports, friends of media, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organisations, artists of discussions, everybody should lead this movement through their own methods.
Awaken the society, unite everyone and unite.
You see, we can see changes in front of our own eyes.
Let us draw a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to conserve water.
You can share your content with the use of hashtag janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
Just as on 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, three or four generations of each family have joined together to celebrate Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is on the rise in awareness about Holistic Health Care.
If every corner of the world welcomes the sun with the sun, then the entire journey ends with the sunset.
The President, the Prime Minister, the distinguished personalities, the people of different countries of the world, showed me on a visitor how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very large family with happiness.
We all know that a healthy society needs a healthy and sensitive person, Yoga ensures that.
Therefore, the promotion and promotion of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
Prime Ministers Awards were announced in 2019 for their outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga, which is a good news for me.
This award has been given to those organizations of the world who have played a vital role in the promotion and promotion of Yoga.
For example, Japan Yoga Niketan has made Yoga very popular across Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs a number of institutes and training courses.
And wherever it is related to yoga, can Indians remain behind
Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger, Bihar has been honoured for the past few decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munich has also been honored with the establishment of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
To celebrate Yoga and to honour those who have brought home the message of Yoga, these two things have added a separate dimension to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours is awaiting your thoughts, feelings, new resolutions and new energy.
You can connect yourself with your thoughts, it is important for me that Mann Ki Baat is exactly the same.
May your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In the next month, we will again meet you in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is immensely filled with the start of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
In order to address this challenge before the country, all of us have to forget race, communalism, regionalism and other integrity so that we can take stronger, stronger and effective steps against terrorism.
Our armed forces are very courageous.
You have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The Army has taken a solemn pledge to destruct terrorists and their alcoholics.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, an inspirational message came to the fore through the media, which inspires the people of the country with immense courage, enthusiasm and energy.
Ramnanjan ji, father of Shahid Ratna ji, in Bhagalpur, Bihar, has given us a solemn pledge of determination during this sad hour.
He said that his other sons would also be sent to fight the enemies of the country and would be present on the battlefield if needed.
The country is conveying its heartfelt bravery to the valour of Meenaji, the wife of a martyr of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He resolved to join his only son in the CRPF.
When the body of Shahid Vijay Soren, who was buried in the national flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son used to say that he too would join the general body.
With the encouragement of this innocent child, this determination and vision reflects the vision of young children of India.
My dear countrymen, all of us have been waiting for the War Memorial in such a long time since independence.
It is natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and feelings about it.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on the App, expressed his happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial at Odupi, Karnataka.
I was surprised and anguished that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai, was born in February 29-29.
You all are aware that this special day comes once in four years.
In a simple, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most dedicated leaders of the country.
In our independent India, Morarji Bhai is the country's record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament.
During that difficult period, Morarji Desh ji gave India the right leadership when democracy in the country was in a dangerous situation.
Morarji Bhai had dedicated himself in the movement against Emergency to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money even after coming to Buddha.
The government arrested him and sent him to jail.
But in 1977, when people voted, he became our Prime Minister.
During his tenure, 44th Constitutional Amendment was proposed.
This is important because the 42nd Amendment to the Emergency was proposed where the power of the Supreme Court was abrogated and some other proposals were made so that our democratic values could not be neutralized.
For example, due to the 44th Amendment Resolution, all the work done by Parliament and Legislative Assembly was made public in the newspaper.
The amendment proposes that the fundamental rights of the citizens should not be deducted by clauses 20 and 21 of the Constitution.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, every year, people have been very curious about the Padma Awards.
I would like to tell you about such people today.
Recognizing the importance of Abdul Ghafoor Khatdi ji in Gujarat, he has done wonderful work to revive the ancient rogan art of Kutch.
He has done a great job in bringing this rare industry to the new generation.
I had gifted the former US President Barack Obama the "Tree of Life" made by Abdul Ghafoor.
Among the awardees of the Padma Awards, everyone knows Sabbi's brother-in-law of Marathwada as the Sevak of Gomata.
He said that the way he has spent his entire life in the service of cow slaughter.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who has tried to strengthen and self-reliant the victims and exploited through the Kalanjiyam Movement in Tamil Nadu.
At the age of 100, he has trained all people around the world in yoga and till now 1500 yoga teachers have been established.
In Jharkhand's famous Lady Tarzan, Yamuna Tudu, has done a brave job of dealing with planting mafia and designers, he has not only saved 50 hectares of wild flying, but has also collectively sent ten thousand women to protect the trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamunaji, today the people of the village make 18 at the time of birth of every child and plant 10 trees at the time of every girl's wedding.
He dedicated himself to the cause of self-reliance and self-reliance of visually impaired children by creating an institution called Chhokhi Mahila Sevakunj.
My dear countrymen, this is the first time that those who have been awarded the Padma awards have 12 farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture and those who directly belong to the farmers are very small in the list of 'Pamshree' beneficiaries.
And this is the living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to share a heart-breaking experience with all of you.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana - PM-JYA and PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand how big a change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you know a poor person who is not able to cure money, you will be aware of this scheme.
These schemes have been implemented for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters, school examinations are going to start.
Several educational institutions across the country will be preparing for the examinations of the Parliament and the 12th class boards.
My best wishes to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a massive event was organized at Town Hall Format in Delhi.
I extend my warm greetings to all the students, their teachers, their parents and their parents on the recordings of this programme.
My dear countrymen, India will talk and it will not be a matter of worship.
Perhaps there is no day in our country with which there is no festival or pride, because we have thousands of years old heritage.
And in a few days, Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri has fallen on Mondays and when Shivratri falls together, our hearts are filled with a lot of sacred feelings and devotion.
I have to acknowledge that I have been impressed with the power of Divyangjan.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience of connecting with all of you through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have faced millions of families every month through radio.
Sometimes, I got the opportunity to read your letters, talk to you people or listen to your suggestions and suggestions.
It's a pleasure for me.
Friends, election is the biggest festival of democracy.
For the next two months, we will be busy with the elections.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He spent his entire life in the field of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The cultivation of semi-cultural plants in Siddhaganga.
I once again convey my sincere regards to such a great man.
But today I'm gonna talk about something else.
Imagine, just for one betrayer.
If you're unable to beat for some reason, you're gonna have to suffer for some reason.
I would like to appeal to the people of my country, to regulate the electoral rollout in the Amrus bi-mile and to raise the issue of election rollout.
My beliefs will strengthen our democracy in the larger number of young voters and in the partnership of our citizens.
This is where the British rulers dealt with Col. Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurubux Singh and Major General Shahan.
When I looked at the relevant figures related to the Red Fort, Netaji's family members gave me a special puppet.
Neta ji used it once.
I have arranged for the Satellite Summit so that people can look at it and inspire the people of the world to look at the Satellite Summit.
The valour of our heroes, the patriotic tales of our younger generations are immensely imbibed in various media.
I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands earlier this month on 30th December.
But it was the 75-year-old air crash of the Azad Hindsar government.
Dillichlo, Your Father, I am your Freedom Allowance.
A couple of years ago, all the files related to Netaji would have to be made public.
I'm glad we're doing this.
On that day, I believe that the Prime Minister had come to the residence of Netaji as a member of the family.
I have been told that the radio stations are weekly in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pusti, Urdu.
BASS BASSED THE GREATION OF THE GREATION.
The museum is the historical exhibition and there's a 450-year-old shipping art work protected.
The artworks of the greatest artists of Amritshergil, Rajarabiburma, Avnindranath Takur, Ganesh Tattakur, Nandlal Bose, Jaminira, Shailja Mukhirji have been exhibited here.
He made a lot of painting.
He added that the birds have immense natural beauty, and he has immensely embraced human character in the medium of crafts.
It is surprising that this art work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore has never been recognised.
If he thinks he is painting, let him know about the creation of artisans by looking at them.
Orpainting has also been exhibited in various countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will see the painting of your night temple.
My dear countrymen, the land of the saints of India.
Our endeavours have given rise to harmony, harmony and socio-economic capabilities in the minds of the people.
There was a time when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had said:
The birth anniversary of February Vidas in 1945.
The last 24-Seasonwaris our kalam-sat has been exploring our children.
Orissa's students have exhibited sounding rockets.

Geo-Tagkar has also taken several other resource base of MNREGA.
Our satellites are symbols of the country's magnitude.
We are also extending our shared interests in many other countries of the world.
South Asiasatellites have promoted our neighbourhood through a more concentrated enterprise.
Why are they all in the rakhershed

The Golden Jubilee of Asansolanians 10 Years Abhinavashakhelo India YouthGems
Akshata Baswani Kamti is the golden silver jubilee of a single peasant family in Karnataka.
When I talk about the upliftment of New India, this is the solemn pledge of New India.
To quote these short stories of sports in India, only the people of Buddhist cities, small towns, cattle, village-to-week, youngsters and youngsters have received extensive exchanges.
My little friends, they're on the test day.
Himachal Pradesh has been described as 'Anshulshmygov' and I will have to say something to all those exams and their opponents.
Anguliji, thank you very much for this.
Yeah, it's a few familiars who prefer this examination.
Students, their parents and teachers are terrific about each others examinations.
I extend my best wishes to all the learners, their parents and teachers.
I am happy to say this thing on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat today, but you will be happy to know that I will speak to the candidates of the state in the ParikshaPeachcharcha on 29th-September, 2011-12.
Strass Free Exams will be more important for my young friends in the field of examinations, especially by undertaking an unexpected examination.
In this context, I have come to understand the opinions of the people and the opinions of the people of Mygov are being suggested in this regard.
Wherever we are, we must pay two minutes to the martyrs.
We will move ahead with the commitment of revered Bapu to fulfil his dreams, the creation of a New India, the duties of the civil society.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
We're entering 2019.
What kind of initiative can we take so that we can bring about change in our lives and take our country and society forward
My best wishes to all of you in 2019

Electricity has reached every village of the country.

All these things have been achieved by the indomitable efforts of 130 crore people.
My dear countrymen, in December this year we have lost some of our extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jaya Chandran lost his life in Chennai on 19th December.
Narasamma was a helping weapon for pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
In the beginning of this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagitti Narasamma have many outstanding personalities who have laid down their lives for the betterment of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of the doctors in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago some of my party officials told me that some young doctors of the city are camping and treating the poor free of cost.
Now hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors and friends who are selflessly engaged in service is really commendable.
Today, I can say with pride that our collective efforts have made the Swachh Bharat Mission a successful campaign.
Some people have told me that more than three lakh people have joined the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh a few days ago.
In this magnificence of Swachhata, the citizens, NGOs, school-children, and the masses of Jabalpur participated with enthusiasm.
That's where I can find out about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever there is time, I go to The Batter India.com website and try to know about such incentives.
I am happy that today there are several such websites that introduce us to the life story of inspiring people.
You can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home through Sanskrit Bharati.
I believe that many people will know about these heroes who have brought about changes in society.
It is very easy to spread negativeness but surrounding us, there is a lot of good work in our society and this is possible due to the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a different significance in all societies.
Whenever there is a game, the audience also feels very enthusiastic.
I would like to talk about Hannaya Nisar, a daughter of Kashmir, who won the gold medal in Carette in Korea.
Twelfth year Hannaya lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
I wish all the countrymen a bright future.
Many congratulations and blessings for Hannaya.
Similarly, there are several discussions on the media about sixteen daughters, sixteen Rajini.
You must have read.
Junior Boxing of Rajini Girls won the gold medal in 1947.
He does so in honor of his father, Jasm Singh, who sells luxury in a waterway shop.
Rajni informed that her father had to admit a lot of sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.
Josm Singh got out of work every morning before Rajni and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing to his father, he tried his best to enhance his enthusiasm and fulfil his dreams.
Rajni Boxing Practice started with old gloves, because his family's financial condition wasn't good.
Despite all adversity, Rajni did not lose courage and continued to teach boxing.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
As I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni, I congratulate her parents, Jasam Singh and Usrani for being close to Rajni and encouraging her.
This month, the twenty-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni of Pune has made the world proud to be the fastest Asian in the world.
He had cycled about 300 kilometers per day for 159 days.
Imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His indomitable enthusiasm for cycling is really commendable.
Adversity never stops.
When we listen to other examples of this kind, we also get a new inspiration in every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, several festivals are being celebrated in January like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttaranchal, Magha Bihu, Maghi etc.
In all these festivals, the whole of India will see the color of traditional dance, iron ore, blooming in the sky, blooming in the sky.
There will be sports events somewhere, and there will be festivals to sweeten each other with sweets.
All these festivals are called separately, but are aimed at observing festivals which are somehow linked to agriculture and rural life.
At this time the sun rises and the sun enters the Makar Rashi.
Since then, the day begins to grow gradually and winter season starts to harvest.
I also extend my best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters on this occasion.
Ek Bharat, Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat is one of the most glorious festivals of this idea.
We can see how deep these festivals are connected with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not separated, individuals and groups are united.
Another beautiful example of our detail with nature is the Festival-based calendar.
These calendars are accompanied by Festivals throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and biological events is.
Based on the speed of the moon and the sun, this lunar calendar will determine the duration of festivals and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to be held at many places on the planet.
The festivals like Gudi Padwa, Cheti Chand, Ugadi are celebrated in accordance with the lunar calendars like Tamil Puthandu and Vishu, Vaishakh, Vaishakhi, Paila Vaishakh, Bihu etc.
Many of us have a special objective of protecting rivers and water in the mountains.
Chhat Parbati is associated with the worship of the sun in rivers and lakes.
In Makar Sankranti, lakhs of people take bath in the holy rivers.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have a mythological significance, on the other hand, these festivals provide a very simple teaching and inspiring spirit of brotherhood in life.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best.
Share the photos on this festival with all of you so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are so many things in our culture that we can take pride in and we can highlight the entire world and we can see the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Many films also showcase the legacy and enormousness of the fair and they are really important as the form of Kumbh is very rich.
People from all over the country and the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Mela is witness to the gathering of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from abroad are coming together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has been nurtured and nurtured by our great cultural heritage.
Sant-Mahatmara has started reaching the Kumbh Mela from now on.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was listed on the Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassador of many countries had seen the preparations for the Kumbh.
The National Flag was unveiled at the same time.
More than 150 people from the country are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
This can be a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago, and I saw that the Kumbh is preparing for a strong future.
The people of Prayagraj are very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
This incarnation of the faith of the people was closed in the fort for thousands of years so that the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the door of Akshay Bot has been opened for everyone.
My appeal to you people is that when you visit Kumbh, you must share the different features and pictures of the Kumbh on social media so that people inspire more and more people to visit Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January the people of the country are very keen on the occasion of Republic Day, and on that day we remember those great men who gave us the Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the revered Bapu.
It is a privilege for us that the President of South Africa, Shri Siriel Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day this time.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan had become the Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood up against casteism.
He had established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm from which the voice of peace all over the world was heard.
He had the courage and inspiration of spending so many years in prison since venerable Bapu.
Mandela said, "Spirit is an integral part of our history because here he used himself first on the path of truth.
There is a detailed discussion on how to strengthen the security of the country and the country.
In this conference, I have announced the launch of the Sardar Patel Awards for National Unity which will be given to those who have contributed in some way or the other to national unity.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his life for the unity of the country.
He has worked for the rest of his life to keep India's integrity intact.
He said the country is united in diversity of the country.
I would like to pay my homage to Sardar Patel through this award of Unity.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patan.
He left his last breath at Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has received his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh said that it is the biggest service to alleviate the grief of the people.
His Majesty was full of valour, valour, sacrifice and creed.
His extraordinary wisdom was in arms and scriptures.
He was an archer on the one hand, a masterpiece, Braj Language, Sanskrit, Farsi, Hindi, Thailand etc.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are good things in the country that are not widely practiced.
Several events are being organized across the country to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Efforts to create safe and healthy food habits.
As part of the Eat Right India campaign, SwasthBharatYatra is being organised across the country.
The expedition will continue till 27th January, 2019.
India will be prosperous only when it becomes clean and healthy.
A nutritious diet is needed for good health.
Whether individual life or national life or social life is a source of inspirational progress.
Come, let us move ahead with innovative inspiration, innovation, innovative resolve, innovative goals, innovative goals, innovative heights, change ourselves and change our country.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
Today, the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
Golden Jubilee Episode.
Most of the letters and phone calls that have been received today are about the 50th edition.
Through the MyGov App, development from Parthukumar, Kamalkumar, Patna and Manika Jain of Delhi on Narendra Modi App, Government of West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have sent almost every one of these questions.
This question is very natural.
Why did Modi bring back the radio in today's era when people had almost forgotten the radio
Now the shopkeeper says, listen to the radio.
I heard on the radio, the bomb exploded.
The shopkeepers said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said that the historical significance of the Nuclear Bombs test was to break the bomb.
I was wondering to see the joy and dance of the shopkeeper in this area, in the snowy mountains, in the jungles, these shopkeepers are listening to the radio all day.
I have been thinking about the Communication Reach of Radio and its far-reaching impact.
After that, when I became the Prime Minister, I would like to seek the most powerful connectivity.
Since the month of May 2014, when I started assuming the charge of the Chief Servant, I felt that the unity of our country, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, people's diversity, mankind, emotions, sacrifices, penance and penance should spread this story to all the people of the country.
I have reached the 50th edition to read lakhs of letters every month, to hear phone calls, to know about various apps and to share them with me, to talk about my own fun.
The results of that survey are very encouraging.
Seventy percent of those listening to Mann Ki Baat have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people think that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of positive thinking amongst all sections of the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movement has achieved a lot of expansion.
Has Tag India Positive have been discussed in a number of discussions.
This is a transformation in which people are coming forward for social service.
Modi will come and go, but this country will live for ever, and our culture will be immortal.
These short stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
A new motivation filled with enthusiasm will give the country a new height.
I read letters and feel like this in them and work with them.
I have realized both these things myself and shared them and shared them with you all.
But who knows when these words go home again.
Whether a government will be able to empower such a government that schemes like Selfie with Daughter will start from a small village in Haryana, it will spread not only in the entire country but also in the entire world.
Every section of the society, every section of the society, even the celebrity, has demonstrated the ideals of the society in such a modern language that illuminates the modern generation.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has also been enjoyed, but in my mind, 130 crore Indians have always been in vicinity.
Their minds are mine.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government - it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life in which politics is one aspect.
Politics cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that other talents or other talents of the society become neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talents of the people and other things of the society for the bright future of countries like India and to take care of them and to make a small effort to move ahead with the goal of Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that Mann Ki Baat is the biggest achievement of the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat, not the Prime Minister, but the closest partner of yours, that is democracy.
There is also a toll-free number -  7800, and people record their message in their voices.
I try to read as many letters and comments as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I've heard a lot of calls.
This time, the Mann Ki Baat episode continues to come forward, I keep reading your thoughts and thoughts at different places.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have spent nearly 40-45 years of my life in the entire country and in most of the districts of the country, I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place.
Thereafter, I would like to note some information, such as village, name of the individual.
Truly, in Mann Ki Baat, the voice is mine, but for example, the emotions and the energy of my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who contribute to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet taken the name of Mann Ki Baat, but they continue to send their letters and comments without being disappointed.
I have full faith that your message will come to me more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more attractive, effective and useful.
It is also being tried that all letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should be monitored by the concerned departments for all the letters and suggestions.
I would also like to thank all the media, Doordarshan, other TV channels and friends of social media.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching out to the maximum number of people by their hard work.
Thus, they became Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I would like to congratulate them for their talent and skills.
I urge all of you to listen to this event in your regional language as well.
I also thank those friends of the media who are regularly organizing the Mann Ki Baat programme on their channels.
Any political person is not satisfied with the media, thinks he is less covered or negatively covered, but the media has taken up a lot of issues that have been published in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete without your help.
Nidhi-Yes, thank you very much for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secret.
What I'm doing is perhaps in all families.
In simple terms, I try to make myself like all those youngsters, keep myself in that position and try to match their opinions with a wave length match.
We have some old baggages in our own lives, if they don't come forward then it becomes easier to understand someone.
We don't know how one of us has acknowledged others than one of us and has acknowledged themselves.
The good quality of the present youth is that he never does what he does not believe in himself, and when he believes in something, he leaves everything behind.
Often people talk about the communication gap between the elders of the family and the teenager.
But most of the families had limited discussions with the teenagers.
Most of the time you talk about reading or habits, life style, don't do this.
It is also a matter of concern that conversations are gradually decreasing in the family without any restrictions.
Any media becomes very important if it replaces the expectations and discusses without any difficulty.
I have been in constant touch with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I have always learnt from the thoughts of the youth.
Young people have a lot of ideas.
Youngsters are enthusiastic, innovative and innovative.
Some people say that young students want to work together.
I tell you, what's wrong with that
They are skilled in multi-tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, be it social enterprises, start-ups, sports or any other field, big changes are brought about by the youngsters.
The young men who dared to question and dream.
If we can give up the ability to make decisions on the youth and if they can openly express their thoughts then they can bring about a constructive change in the country and they do it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MiGov web site, Vineeta ji wrote that this time there is a need to say something about the Insolvency Day of 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventieth year of the Constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
Let us commemorate all those great personalities who have created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949.
It took two years and eleven months and 17 days to complete this historic work of drafting the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these great talented persons have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The unprecedented speed at which the Constitution was created is an example of Time Management and Productivity.
Inspired by this, we are also eager to finish our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of the great talents of the country, in which every country was committed to providing such a Constitution that empowers the people of India and the poorest of the poor also becomes a supporter.
The salient features of our Constitution are the detailed description of rights and responsibilities.
The balance between these two things will take the country forward in the lives of citizens of the country.
If we respect each other's rights, you will be protected from your rights and if we do our duty in the Constitution, then we will be able to protect our rights.
I remember that in 2010, in 60 years of India's democracy, in Gujarat, we had taken a pilgrimage on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable endeavour to make the youth aware of the Constitution and make them interested in the various clauses of their Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we will complete 70 years and we will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us all respect the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Babasaheb who has given the right to save crores of Indians with dignity.
Babasaheb was under his concern and he used to say that India's democratic ideals are not external.
The definition of democracy or parliamentary system was nothing new to India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had an emotional insistence that we have achieved this independence after many battles and that is why we have to protect it with the last drop of blood.
He used to say that no matter how much Indians grow in different environments, we should always think of the welfare of the country.
Once again I pay my homage to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, we have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev on 23rd November 2019, to mark his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished for the welfare of humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
Our country will commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev next year and the country will be spread across the world by printing it.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to observe this day with Dhammadham.
Thus, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the world.
Along with this, a train will also be run in all the sacred places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara when I was discussing this issue recently.
This Gurudwara was widely damaged during the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, but the way the state government took the local people along and revived that Gurudwara.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that passengers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev at Kartarpur in Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th edition, we will again meet in Mann Ki Baat, I believe that for the first time I had the idea of Mann Ki Baat.
Our journey will continue.
The more I get your courage, the deeper this journey will be and satisfactory.
Sometimes people ask me what I got from Mann Ki Baat.
Today, I would like to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart. Most people have said that when they sit and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme, they feel that the goddess of the family is sharing their thoughts with them.
When I came to know about the fact that I was one of you, one of you, one of you, and all of you made me bigger, I was very happy that I would come again and again as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat, I would be with you.
I wish you, too.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
My wish is that all of you must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
Approximately six and a half months before independence, photos of Sardar Patel were published in the edition of the famous international newspaper Time magazine on 27th January, 1947.
The Time Service was designed by India in its lead store.
There were more than 550 Indian kingdoms.
Though the interest of the British in India was lost, they wanted to keep the country divided.
The Time Magazine wrote, the dangers of separation, violence, food crisis, price rise and power-politics are possessing India. But if anyone has the power to unite the country in this regard, then he will be Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji had told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so terrible that you can only find solutions to it.
Sardar Patel has truly solved one problem and has done the impossible task of bringing the whole country together.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Tribanku or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel is the only person who considers and sees India in a war strategy.
We naturally remember the remembrance of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel when we look at our Mother India, a nation bound by unity.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is even more important because we will pay tributes to him on this day to the Statue of Unity.
Settled on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the statue is twice the height of the US Statue of Liberty.
It will be the world's highest skyline architecture.
Every Indian can proudly say that the tallest statue in the world is now in India.
I believe that this unique architecture in the country will be identified as a favourite penance.
This was the day when Indian soldiers landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from intruders.
This historical event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old meeting of the great soldiers of India, Sam Manekesh.
Field Marshal Manekesh spoke about the time when he was the Colonel.
At that time, a military campaign started in Kashmir in 1947.
The Field Marshal Maneksh said, "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was disturbed at a meeting to delay the deployment of troops in Kashmir. In the meeting, Sardar Patel drew his habit and looked at Manekesh and said that there will be no delay in the operation of the army in Kashmir and we will have to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
The death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, on 31st October.
I pay my homage to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like games
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in the field of sports.
These are the measurements of success of a player.
On the other hand, these four qualities are important for nation building.
With all these qualities among the youth of any country, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but also bring the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I have two meetings to remember.
First of all, I got the opportunity to meet the Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
India has made a new record by winning a total of 72 medals in the Games and enhanced the honour of the country.
We have won 3 more medals in the 13 medals additional Mix Event.
You must be reminded that India's performance in the Asian Games was also very good.
Look, in the last few minutes, I've used the best, the most beautiful words so far.
He was a father-in-law at the age of eight.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving Ananthasram, he used to clean the bus of DTC and waiter on the roadside for a life-long train.
This Narayana has won a gold medal for India at International event today.
Not only this, the area of sports in India is spreading such that Judo-like events, where India has not won an Olympic medal in the Junior Level till date, Tababi Devi made a new history by winning silver in Judo at Youth Olympics.
Twenty-six year old Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
Her father sells a day-to-day and mother fish.
Sometimes there was a situation where they didn't have the money to buy food.
Similar situations have also come to a standstill for Goddess Tababi.
He created history by winning medals for the country.
There are many more such stories, their lives are a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson, his enthusiasm is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you remember that we successfully organised the FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has been appreciated in the world's most successful tournaments.
FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECHERD broke the audience.
More than 12 lakh audiences have seen football in various stadiums of the country and have encouraged young players.
This time, India has achieved the privilege of the World Cup hockey organization in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves sports has a different place in their minds.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold several times, has won one contest.
India has also contributed some world class players to the Hockey Games.
Whenever there is a discussion about hockey in any part of the world, it is incomplete.
Hawke's magician Major Meditation is known all over the world.
Besides, Balbinder Singh Sinior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Saheed, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai Hockey has brightened India's name in the world.
Even today, the Hockey players of Team India are setting an example of success for the new generations.
It's a great experience for sports enthusiasts to sit on the stadium.
When we go to Bhubaneswar, we will encourage not only Indian teams but all countries.
Prosperity and cultural excellence have a legacy and the people of Orissa must remember the inspiring character.
It is also a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts to visit Odisha.
I also convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, a lot of people are coming forward in social work, they are volunteering, it is becoming a great inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has committed himself to learning wheelchair basketballs to play basketball in wheelchairs.
This is the spirit of self-employment. This is the mission mode activity.
There is an Indian who will not be proud to hear this.
This idea of 'No, we' will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I was looking at your suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a very exciting remark from Puducherry's Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He wrote in Mygov: In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, please tell us how the tribal and traditional traditions of India are the best examples of unity with nature.
We need to learn something from the sustainable development of our lives.
Manish ji, I express my gratitude to you for putting such a thing in front of the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one thing that inspires me to see our glorious past and culture back, today the world, especially the West, is discussing the environment conservation and looking for a new path for balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far away from this problem, but we have to commit ourselves to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
Bhil tribes of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship trees like Bat and Arjun with reverence.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way to preserve the environment.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for the conservation of trees, but they are not ready to admit the damage to a tree.
Mishmis of Arunachal demand their relationship with tigers.
They call him their own brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger was seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Warlie community of Maharashtra regard the tiger as a guest, and the tiger is a symbol of prosperity.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their destiny is linked to tigers and if tigers do not feed, the villagers will have to remain illiterate.
The Gond tribe of Madhya Pradesh stops fishing at some places in the Breeding Season.
These places are known as fish shelters and they have a lot of fresh fish in this tradition.
Tribal communities build their homes from natural material which becomes strong and environment friendly.
In southern India, there is a small zoological community in the far-flung areas of the Nilgiri Mountain, which, according to tradition, makes their habitations locally available.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and united among themselves, but when someone harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were tribal people.
Who can forget Lord Veerasa Munda who fought hard against the British rule to protect his forest land
There are many examples of tribal communities who teach us how to live in harmony with nature and for the forest wealth that is around us we owe our country to the tribal community.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we talk about the problems of those people and those who have been working for the society.
And all those things that seem to be simple but in reality it has a far-reaching effect on changing our mindset and setting the goals of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji of Panjab.
Gurubachan Singh Ji's son was married to an ordinary and hardworking farmer.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told the parents of Kann that they would marry this marriage.
He suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, on conditions of marriage, he usually thinks he's going to talk about some big hymn, so that the family of Conn's family will be in trouble.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a simple whitesiddha farmer and he told the father of Kann that the condition that I am talking about is the real power of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You should promise me that from now on you will not keep the remains of the crop after you have been harvested in the field of agriculture.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden in it.
It seems extraordinary to Gurubachan Singh ji, but it is his personality, and we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have transformed personal matters into good work for the society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh Ji has just set an example.
I have read about another village of Kallar Majra in Punjab, which is situated near the river.
Kallar Mazar was in the forefront because the people there didn't burn the paddy straw and shook it and mixed it with the soil.
My best wishes to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Kallar Majra and the people of those places who have been trying their best to make the environment pollution free.
You all are moving ahead in the right direction in the healthy lifestyle of Indian heirs.
Just like drops of water produced by sea, small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance for the eleventh day of November this year because the first World War ended on 11th November a hundred years ago.
That is, the end of that horrific destruction and the end of the massacre will be a hundred years.
First World War is an important event for India.
To be honest, we had no connection with this great war.
In spite of this, the soldiers of our country fought with Bahaduri in this war, played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anybody in the field of war.
Our soldiers showered their bravery in difficult situations in remote areas.
All this was aimed at restoring peace.
In the first World War I saw the world's catastrophe.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the whole world understood the importance of peace.
Over the last hundred years, the language of peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a speciality in the North-Eastern region of this country.
The natural beauty of this place is unparalleled and the people here are very talented.
Our north-east is now known for its best and greatest work.
It's a place where organic farming has improved.
A few days ago, the honourable Future Policy Gold Ward has won Sikkim to promote long-term food systems.
The award was conferred on FAO (Formation of Agricultural Organisation).
You will be happy to know that the award for making the best policy in this field is equivalent to Oscars.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won this prize by losing all the nominees of twenty-five countries.
That's why I thank the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is about to end.
Climate change is clear.
Winters have arrived and along with climate change, the season of festivals has also come, Dhanteras, Deepavali, Bhai Phooja, Chhat Puja, November is also the month of festivals.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for the festival.
My condolences to all of you for taking care of yourself, for your health and for the well-being of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more you move, the more you move, the more you move.
