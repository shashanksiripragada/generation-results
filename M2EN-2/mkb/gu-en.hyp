Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
My dear countrymen, today is the sacred festival of Deepawali.
My best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect and shows the intellect.
My heartfelt condolences to such a Divya Yojana may be a better idea to recall this Deepawali, to spread light, to spread positiveness and to destruct the spirit of hostility.
Today Deepawali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is involved in it, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations of that country also celebrate the festival of Deepawali with full joy.
In a way, India stands there.
Friends, Festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our country is a country of festivals with immense possibilities for festivals.
We should strive to spread such festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and also include other states and people of other countries in the happiness of festivals.
There are several different festivals of each and every princely state that the people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided that this Deepawali will do something different in Gi Mann Ki Baat.
Let us all celebrate Indias manpower and achievements, i. e.
Immediately after that, innumerable inspirational stories on social media came to light.
On the Namo App, Kodipaka of Warangal has written that my mother is my power.
Since my father died in 10th century, my mother had taken up the responsibility of our five daughters.
Today we are in a good business.
My mother is God for me.
It is universal for me and that is the true meaning of India's Laxmi.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Deepika Swami, an activist on Twitter, says that Major Sukhbu Kanwar is the Laxmi of India, the daughter of a bus conductor.
India's Laxmi is her daughter for poetry.
He is proud that his daughter makes beautiful paintings.
He has won a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
So Medha Jainji has also written that an old woman of 2 years of age has been providing free water to travellers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Medhaji is inspired by the humility and compassion of India's Laxmi.
Many stories have been shared by the people.
You must read, inspire and share yourself if there is any inspiring story around you.
I respectfully salute all these Lakshadweeps of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 17th century itself.
This poem contains so many beautiful words, so many good feelings and so many excellent ideas.
Peninda Permegondnu Himavanthanu, Peninda Bhrigu Perchidanupaninda Janakarayanu Jaswadenu Arthat, Heemvant, i.e., due to her daughter Parvati, Bhrigu Sage got fame due to her daughter Laxmi and King Janaka for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and it is because of the greatness of these daughters that our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th November, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Sri Gurunak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak ji is not only in India but in the old world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in some countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tahairan.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you, but for that, I want a lot of bits of Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji conveyed his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the highest travelers in his time.
Wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone with ease, humility and simplicity.
Taking a message of goodwill and equality, he visited the north, the east, the west, everywhere, the saints and sages.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankar Dev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
In the south, Guru Nanakdeva ji travelled to Sri Lanka.
During the visit of Bidar in Karnataka Guru Nanak Devji himself had solved the problem of water there .
In Bidar, Gurununk is a famous place of eera Saheb, which also reminds us of Gurununk Devji.
A sad hour Guru Nanak Devji also visited Kashmir in the north and surrounding areas.
It established a strong relationship between learning and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him Guru.
He was also venerated in Uzbekistan where he had travelled.
He gave a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who followed his teachings with full faith and are still doing it today.
Just a few days ago, ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and became the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, several ambassadors had put a picture of it on social media and had described it with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you will definitely remember the 31st of October.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was a great leader to serve the nation in the spirit of unity.
While Sardar Patel had wonderful ability to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to coordinate with those who had ideological differences.
He was a man of detail in true sense.
He was also an expert in organisational skills.
He was instrumental in planning and strategies.
Whenever we read about Sardar Saheb's work style, we can see how compelling his organisation was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were expected to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 121.
He also used the opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
And we have ensured that no one has to face water shortage.
Not only this, he also took care of the fact that the goods or staff of a representative should not be stolen at the place of the commission and you would be very surprised to know what Sardar Patel did in keeping with it.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags.
On the other hand, Khadi's sales also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very big devotion and historic work to unite the Rajwadas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai ji had a special feature that looked at every event.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on Dursudur Lakshadweep.
However, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts then his role in uniting the country is also discussed in some special areas.
Immediately after India's association in 1947, our neighbours looked at Lakshadweep and sent the ship along with their flag.
Just like Sardar Patel knew that he immediately started a tough operation without wasting time.
Immediately after his orders, Triango was flown and all the mindsets of the Democratic Party were destroyed due to occupation of the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliyar brothers to personally ensure that the development of the Lakshadweep remains necessary.
Today, the Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination.
I hope all of you will be visiting these beautiful islands and gardens.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity that was dedicated to the nation and the world on 31st October, 2018 in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in America is twice the height.
The tallest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Indian is elevated with grandeur.
You will be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists had come to visit the Statue of Unity.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the Statue of Unity every day.
Friends, For the country and for all the states, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for tourism industry.
We all are witness to the fact that within a year, a place develops as a world famous tourist destination.
People from all over the country come there.
Transportation, lodging, guides, environment friendly arrangements are being developed one after another.
A very big economy is growing and people are making arrangements there according to the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, Who would be a Hindustani who would not be proud of the fact that in the past days, the Statue of Unity has given importance to the 100 most important tourist destinations of the world.
I am hopeful that all of you will go out to see the Statue of Unity after taking some time out of your valuable time.
This is my request.
Friends, You know that the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting our country's unity, integrity and security at any cost.
Unity Run for Unity is also being organized on 31st October as usual.
It will include people from all sections of the society.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a glimpse and a glimpse for the marathon.
The Run for Unity has also made similar arrangements.
Running is beneficial for all of us.
Here the spirit of Fit India is realized by running here.
At the same time, we are also connected with the objective of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not just the body, mind and culture connects India to a new height for unity.
And that is why you can get connected to the city wherever you live, with the information about the Run for Unity around you.
I hope that all of you will run on 31st October for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has built the country on the lines of unity.
This mantra of unity has turned into a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every juncture.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and mutual understanding of the country.
If we go around, there will be so many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual understanding.
But sometimes it also becomes such that the contribution of the society is very quickly distressed by the memory.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had conveyed its condolences on the Ramzanmabhoomi.
Just remember those days when there was an atmosphere.
The interested groups were playing sports to take advantage of the situation themselves.
What kind of language was being spoken to produce heat in the environment
Efforts were also being made to fill the gap in different voices.
Efforts were made to reduce the waste from the environment.
We must always keep in mind that it gives us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of how the voice of unity can give strength to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to him.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard these things, so I think I will tell you too.
Imagine the world's tallest battlefield, the temperature of which goes from zero to 50 degrees Celsius.
Oxygen is also named in the air.
In contrast to such challenges, it is no less than a coincidence.
In such a vicious situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but they are also running a Clean Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the people of our country for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to rot too.
In such a situation, it is a very important thing in itself to differentiate waste and manage it.
We all know that Siachen is a snow-covered region that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness drive means fixing pure water for the people living in identified areas and also using rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are a celebration of a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in Deepawali, buying something new, bringing something from the market, it has to be produced in lesser quantity in every family.
Once I had said that we should try to buy only local items.
If we have the requirements from our village then there is no need to go to tehsils.
There is no need to go to the district if found in the tehsils.
We will try to buy as many local items as possible.
Gandhian philosophy will automatically become a great opportunity.
And I have been urging you to buy something made by the workers of Khadi built by our weavers brothers and sisters.
This Deepawali must have purchased a lot before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who think that if I go after Diwali then perhaps I will get a little cheaper.
So there will be many people who will still have to buy.
So along with the wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward to buy local items.
You know, we can also play an important role in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on this auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
In Deepawali, we are spreading a variety of shocks.
But some kind of irregularity engulfs us.
There are some injuries too.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great joy.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Probably there would be an Indian who would not be proud of our armed forces, our armed forces.
Every Indian, whether it is in any field, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the perspective of proxy war in the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces organised exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, know what our strength is, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives in danger.
Like the Parakram Parv, the day reminds youngsters of the glorious legacy of our armed forces.
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a furious answer to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our nation.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but by compromising with dignity and at the cost of the sovereignty of the nation, it is not at all.
India has always been committed and committed to peace.
In the 20th century, in two world wars, more than one lakh of our soldiers made their supreme sacrifice for peace and that was when we had nothing to do with the war.
Our eyes were never on any other earth.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on September 23, we remembered our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers, who had liberated Haifa from the acts of action.
It was also a culmination of our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest military deployments in the UN peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing a blue helmet.
One of the most urgent stake in the parade during the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past in which our Air Force showcases its strength with the wonderful cars.
On 8th October, we celebrate the Air Force Day.
Our Air Force is today among the most courageous and powerful air force of the 21st century, moving ahead with a small start with 6 pilots and 1 Air Warriors in 1932.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Warriors and their families who have served for the nation.
In 1944, when Pakistani attackers launched an unprecedented attack, it was the air force that ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield on time to save Srinagar from the attacks.
The Air Force also responded bitterly to enemies in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1919
Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the occupation of 1977.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force dumped them by bombing the enemy at night.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to our air warriors for their commendable work.
From storms, storms, floods to forest fires, their morale has been amazing to face natural calamities and help the countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving women an alternative to the Short Service Commission along with the Permanent Commission which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th December this year.
India can proudly say that the armed forces of India are contributing not only to the manpower but also to the women power.
Women are not only empowered but now they are also becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our officers in the Navy, Abhilash Tomy, was fighting for his life and death.
The entire country was wondering how to save a tommy.
You are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without any modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he had been moving ahead with his pace in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but he created a terrible maritime calamity for him but the valour of the Indian Navy remained in the midst of the sea for several days.
I had met Tommy earlier too.
Even after coming out of such a difficult situation, his courage was strong, his determination to do something like this once again is an inspiration for the youth of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tomy and his valour, determination, determination and strength to win will inspire the young generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows the importance of 2nd October for our nation.
2nd October this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we are going to organize several events across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or great scholars like Nelson Mandela, each one of them got the strength from Gandhijis ideals and fought a long way in ensuring equality and dignity for their people.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of revered Bapu, which the countrymen should know more.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Then, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was gaining momentum, he prepared a revised imitation of those ideas.
Revered Bapu has put forward his thoughts to the countrymen on a wide range of topics such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages, labourers, spreading cleanliness and education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a folk collector.
It was Bapu's speciality to connect with people and connect them with themselves.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every individual feel that it is the most important and essential requirement for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
In the freedom struggle movement, every section of the society, every section of the society, on the call of Mahatma Gandhi, dedicated itself.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra which is often known as Gandhijis penance.
In this, Gandhiji had said, I am a gentleman to you. Whenever you are skeptical that if you start coming to your place in the morning, remember the faces of the poorest and weakest person you have seen.
Will it benefit from this
Would he have some control over his own life and destiny
Does it mean that those crores of people who are hungry and are unsatisfied
Then you will see that your doubts are being corrected and ending here.
My dear countrymen, a party of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class in the country, its growing economic power, increasing purchasing power, can we remember Bapu for a moment if we go for any purchase
Can we remember the venerable Bapu's entourage
Will you be fortunate to benefit from your purchase in a straight or risky manner
And if the poorest of the poor benefits the poor, then my happiness will be more than usual.
Recalling Gandhiji's visit, whenever we buy something, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, let us think that every Indian should be required from our purchases and in this also he who has sweated his sweat, who has dedicated his talent, all of them should have some benefit.
And I believe that a small step in the lives of the poorest and the weakest person can bring immense results.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that if you do cleanliness, you will get freedom then perhaps he would not know how it would be.
Similarly, today we can feel that even with this small task of mine, I can make a big difference in the economic progress of my country, in economic empowerment, in the fight against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era.
For example, if we consider buying Khadi and handloom products on specific occasions, it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to keep the old or broken clothes of Khadi safe because somebody's hard work is hidden in them.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are made of utmost hard work, one of them should come to work.
This feeling of affection for the countrymen and love for the countrymen was inherent in the rage of the great man.
Two days later, along with revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
With the name of Shastri ji, the feeling of infinite faith emerges in the hearts of our Indians.
His gentle personality always fills every citizen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had a special feature that he looked very humble from outside but from within he was determined as a mountain.
His portrait of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a recognition of his immense personality.
As a result of his selfless penance towards the nation, during his one and a half year brief tenure, he gave mantras to bring the soldiers and farmers of the country to the heights of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering revered Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot live without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I was also fortunate that I would do sanitation work with the children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to that school whose foundation was laid by Babasaheb himself.
Every class of people across the country joined this shrine on the 15th of this year.
Institutions also contributed to Rangcheng.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS, youth organisations, Media Groups, Corporate Governance, all have performed Swachhta Shramdaan at a large scale.
I heartily congratulate all these Swachhata lovers for this thing.
Let's hear a phone call
You can say a lot, cleanliness has its own significance in everyones lives and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, toilets have been constructed in your houses and now you are getting affordable.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign may not be guessed that you cannot see because of being an observer, but if you didn't have a toilet, you might have to spend your life with so many difficulties.
Perhaps you had also not called for connecting this aspect. Perhaps this sensitivity is not visible even in the attention of the people associated with this movement of cleanliness.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but all over the world.
This time India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness summit in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, i.e. Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, and experts from all over the world are coming together to share their experiments and experiences related to cleanliness.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) will be concluded on 2nd October, 2018 with the launch of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu.
It is especially essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, oppressed and the underprivileged.
Dr.
The Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar provides for the protection of basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on October 12, 13.
A few days later, the NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to increase human dignity.
Our beloved leader, our former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are not a single concept for us.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideals of Vedic times.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has also played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I understand that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, in addition to the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and behave in a manner that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the month of October or the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan or be it the beginning of the centenary year of Rajmata Vijayaraj Ji, all these great men have been inspiring us all, we bow down to them and we bow down to Sardar Saheb on 31st October. I will talk to you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I would like to mention that on 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organized in every small town of India, in every small town of India, in every village of India.
This year too, we should try to organise the Run for Unity in our villages, cities, cities and metropolis.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society through the Run for Unity on 31st October and that will be a great tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the entire nation is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been a great example of social harmony.
There are several such stories in the history of the country in which one stalwart has added two different states or religions to the fiction of faith.
A few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also coming.
The entire climate will be illuminated by the accumulation of elephants, horses, palanquins, jay Kanaiya Red Keys and Govinda Govinda.
The joy of painting in the color of Lord Krishna is slightly different.
Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami greetings to all the countrymen.
My best wishes to all fellow citizens on Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to the daughter Chinmati who raised this topic.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, a Sanskrit day is also celebrated on the day of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in protecting, nurturing and bringing this great heritage to the people.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And we all Indians also take pride in the fact that from time immemorial to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a very big role in spreading knowledge.
The share of knowledge related to every sphere of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which there is a possibility of creating infinite words.
20000 metals, 200 per cent i. e.
And therefore, in any subtle sense, a subtle emotion or subject can be expressed at once.
That is, if a guru gives a letter to his disciple then there is no such thing in the whole earth that the disciple can take off the debt of his Guru.
We all celebrate such a teaching day, knowledge and guru are invaluable, priceless and invaluable.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
Along with this, I thank you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon brings new hopes for our hardworking farmers.
Weakness provides monsoon relief to dry trees and dry waterfalls in the summer.
But sometimes it also brings a very rainy and devastating flood.
Nature has emerged in such a situation that there have been more rains than other places.
Right now, we have seen that Kerala has had a very bad impact on the lives of people.
Today, the entire country stands with Kerala in this difficult situation.
Our compassion is with those families.
I am confident that Kerala will be re-established very soon due to the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state.
But we also see humanity during disasters.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other for the cause of the common man, be it Kerala or any other district or region of India.
All the elderly and all those associated with every field of work are making their contributions.
We all know that the Armed Forces are the dryest of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned in saving the people trapped in floods.
Whether it is an air force, a navy or a ground team or be it BSF, CISF, RAF, everyone has played a major role in the rescue and relief operations.
I would also like to specially mention the hard work of the brave soldiers of NDRF.
Our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji is the subject on which people from all over the country have written the most.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonapat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr.
Akhil Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, several innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and on May Gov asking me to talk about different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th of August, when the country and the world heard the news of the passing away of Atal ji, everyone was shocked.
The leaders of a nation who had left the Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
The kind of affection, reverence and grief that has emerged throughout the country for Atal ji showcases his immense personality.
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have emerged before the country.
India will always be indebted to Atalji for the 1st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two major changes in India's politics.
Firstly, the stature of the Cabinet in the States was restricted to 15 of the Assembly Constituencies.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Anti-Pakistan Act has been increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Along with this, clear guidelines have also been fixed to disqualify the participants.
For many years, the political culture of building big ministries in India was home to those big ministries which were not meant for sharing work but for making the politicians happy.
Atal ji changed this culture.
Their move saved money and resources.
In addition, efficiency has also increased.
Atal ji was such a perspective that changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2017, Atal ji changed the time of presentation of the budget from 5 PM to 11 PM.
Thus, he brought our beloved Tiranga closer to the people.
I would certainly like to say that for a healthy democracy, for a better democracy, for a better democracy, for a better democracy, for a stronger democracy and for a stronger democracy, it will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Just a few days back, the Monsoon Session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and it was 4 of Rajya Sabha.
And as a result, 21 Bills and Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills in this Session.
This Monsoon Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of the youth.
Several important legislatures that benefit the youth and the backward classes were passed in this session.
You all are aware that for decades, like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, there was a need to set up OBC Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled its pledge to set up the OBC Commission this time.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and United Kingdom on Cooperation in the field of Sustainable Development.
The Act shall safeguard the interests of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent the offenders from committing injustice to the people of this class and irrigate faith in the Dalit communities.
No member can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Objective Law Amendment Bill and has promulgated severe punishment for such offenders for at least 10 years of imprisonment.
Where girls below 12 years of age will be punished for being harassed.
Just a few days back, it must have been read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has completed the hearing in just two months and sentenced two offenders to death on one occasion.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the culprits to death after just five days of hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts there have made such a hurry.
The Act will play an effective role in curbing the offences against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time in the Chausamy session, everyone has presented an ideal together.
Today I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions of citizens is now on the Asian Games that are being held in public domain.
Every morning, people first look at the prints, TV, news, social media and watch that any Indian sportsperson has won a medal.
Asian Games are still on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to the players whose competitions are yet to be held.
Indias sportspersons are particularly excellent in marking and wrestling, but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in such sports, in which we have never seen before, like sports and boating.
This is not just a medal, but an ancient Indian sports and sportsperson's skies are awesome hues and dreams.
Our daughters are among the increasing number of medal winners for the country, this is a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the young sportspersons who have won medals, we also have a growing youth of 15-16 years of age.
This is also a very good indicator that most of the sportspersons who have won medals reside in small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sports enthusiasts and pay my tributes to Shri Dhyan Chand ji, the architect of Hockey.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play sports and take care of their eagerness as a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then it will create a bright future for India.
Namaste Bhavna ji, I respect your spirit.
But can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain that was an ancient rock was given the shape of a magnificent large and magnificent temple, perhaps it was difficult to imagine.
If anyone tells you that a 60 metre long pillar of granite was built about a thousand years ago and a 80 ton of granite was laid on its summit.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan, Gujarat.
India has been a Bhumi Engineering Laboratory.
There were many engineers in India who made Alpanyam unimaginable and set an example of miracles in the world of engineering.
In our legacy of great engineers, we have also received such a gem whose work is still surprising to the people.
M.
He is venerable in that part of the country, but the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and spirituality.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
After walking on his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity in the whole world.
When I talk about the miracles in the engineering world, I am reminded of one incident of the terrible earthquake that occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to go to a village where I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age.
They were looking at me and enjoying us and saying, Look, this is my house.
It is called Bhungo in Kutch.
My house has witnessed 3-3 earthquakes.
But you will not find any harm.
This house was constructed by our ancestors according to the natural conditions of this place.
And he was saying this thing with pride that I had the same idea that even centuries ago, what the engineers of that period had created according to the local situation due to which the common man was safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be conducted at different places.
What new things do we have to learn in the changing times
You have to learn
Do we have to connect 
What should students be taught 
How does ero West become our priority 
Whenever we celebrate Engineers Day, we must think.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
Besides, preparations for Diwali also begin.
With the same spirit, many congratulations to everyone.
Thank you, I will meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
At some places people are still waiting for rain.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows rain as a favorite dislike.
But what should we do to the rains
It is human beings who have chosen the path of conflict with nature and consequently, sometimes nature whispers to us.
It usually takes hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day, the accident was something else.
When he went inside the cave for a long time then suddenly due to heavy rains such water was collected near the entrance of the cave .
Their exit route was closed.
Because they did not find any way, they were blocked by a small cliff inside the cave.
And that is not one or two days, for the entire 18 days.
On the one hand, they were facing difficulties.
On the other hand, humanity in the entire world was uniting and demonstrating the human qualities preserved by God.
People from all over the world were praying to take these children out of peace.
The feeling of responsibility at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their family members, the media, the citizens of the country, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody.
Everyone was a team and was associated with their mission.
I believe that there is a subject like learning, it is like understanding.
It is not that the parents are not sad, it is not that tears do not come out of the eyes of the mothers, but the calm behaviour of the patience and the calm behaviour of the entire society is a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity comes to an end, wonderful things are made.
A few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji took a break from us.
Everything can give us a lot of strength and inspiration to the Indians too.
Our school board examined us about the stress and burning of examinations, and for students like me, it is your message now.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam get out of school and join colleges.
If February and March go to exams, paparo and north then in the months of April and May, along with enjoying holidays, consequences are spent on deciding the way ahead in life, choosing a career etc.
The attention of the students is limited from home to school.
Students come under the scanner of their parents.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time we have to come out of our homes, leave our villages, move out of a protective environment and make ourselves friends.
For the first time all these youngsters have to leave their homes and lead their lives in a new condition.
I would like to tell all of you that be calm, believe in life and enjoy the spirit of interaction in life.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages.
He has already achieved success in the MBBS examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father nurtures the waste to his family.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who come from poor families and despite their opposite sensitivities, they have done something that inspires us all.
Then be it the Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata, who studied under the street on footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afreen Sheikh, who runs the autorickshaw.
Whether it is Anushka Pandey, a Divyang daughter of Gurgaon, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called Spain Muscular Atrophy since birth.
All of them have achieved such a success in the entire world by breaking every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we want to be around us, we will also get some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspiration.
And when I am telling you the story of these youngsters, I am reminded of the story of poet Neeraj ji and this is the goal of life.
I was talking to two Indian youth in San Jose City, USA, once known as Technology Hub.
I urged them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something out of time.
He urged them to convert Brain Drain into Brain Gain.
Both the IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee have made an indefinite effort to tackle my challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly developed a smart goal app using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can get any information on their mobile phones.
The Sarpanch, District Magistrate, Teluka Development Officer of the village of Taudakpur village of Rae Bareli, all made the people aware about the use of this app.
It has now become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development works being carried out in the village by recording them through this app.
The app consists of a village phone directory, news department, list of events, health centre and renowned centre.
Grameen features of the app, faculty rates among the farmers, in a way, work as a market for their products.
If you look at this incident carefully then it will be noted that the people of America who have lost their lives in the midst of their lives and practices, those who have left India many years ago also know the miracles of their villages, understand the challenges and are connected to the village emotions.
This is the reason that perhaps they could make the village suitable for it and they could make it better.
This feeling of attachment to our village, its roots and the feeling of doing something for the country is naturally felt within every Indian.
However, sometimes due to some distance, due to some situations, a thin dust accumulates on it, but if a small irritation also touches them then good things emerge again.
Pandharpur is indeed a unique journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July this year, is celebrated as a grand legend of Pandharpur Bari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi, the worker i. e.
Lakhs of workers are added to this journey called Bari.
The grandfathers of great saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were also present on the occasion.
Pilgrims Lord Vithal who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have great respect and devotion.
There is a different experience of visiting the Vithoba Temple in Pandharpur and its beauty, spiritual pleasure in the month there.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to once again experience Pandharpur.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still teaching Adana human beings in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstitions.
Whether it is their burden or dislike, we get the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them.
There is a mantra that society can fight against superstitions.
These were those who, from time to time, demonstrated to the society, tokens and revelations and ensured that the ancient families should be eradicated from our society and the culture of compassion, equality and interest among the people, our land of India is a multi-dimensional habitat.
We bow to Tilak ji on his Jayanti on 23rd July and on his Punya Tithi.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intelligence to show the British rulers the significance of their mistakes.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they wished him treachery three times in 20 years and this is not a small thing.
Today, I would like to place a fascinating incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad, perhaps 100 years ago.
And during this journey, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel got an opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed by Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 120, he decided to build a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
The statue was finally constructed and Sardar Saheb was inaugurated by Khud Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February.
And I am talking about that time of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of Ganesh Festival started.
Public Ganesh Utsav became an impressive medium for enhancing the spirit of social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people along with traditional faith and joy.
Look, there was a time when the country had an end to fight against the British, these festivals had broken the sects of caste and sect and worked to embrace everyone.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
That is why it is known to our brave leaders of our ancient legacy and history as to what is the craze in our youth.
Today, in many cities, this kind of thing is being created that you see the glimpse of Ganesh in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also urged you all to celebrate the Ganesh festival this time also, to celebrate the Ganesh festival, to celebrate the Ganesh festival with full force, but to celebrate the Eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
And I would like to say that the items of Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival should be put on MyGov and Narendra Modi App for a comprehensive publicity.
I will convey your message to the people.
Lokmanya Tilke expressed confidence in the countrymen and invited them to say that Swaraj is our birthright, and we will compete with it, even today it is time to say that.
That is, Swaraj is our birthright and we will overcome it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development results.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar inspired many young people for the bravery and freedom of freedom.
Independently, he put his life on the horse but he never jumped in front of foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Das won the Golden uadrilateral at the 400m race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championships held in Finland.
In response to my letter, I have e-mailed to Indonesia that it is still preparing the Asian Games there.
The name of the country has been illuminated.
Unity has won gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia.
His achievement is special because he has made his challenge a medium of action.
Due to the road accident in 2003, the lower half of the body of daughter Ekta Bhaiya has become useless, but this daughter has achieved this success by not losing courage and strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathuniaji has also won the Golden uadrilateral in Berlin by winning Pera Athletics Grand Pre-Mon Discussion Throw (CHARFANK) in Berlin and Sundar Singh Gurjar has also won Golden uadrilateral in Bhalafank.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals, but due to Mausam sometimes diseases also enter the house.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for this month of August that inspires patriotism and for the many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Once again I will definitely meet for Mann Ki Baat.
Thanks a lot.
Just a few days back, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You people have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
Both the teams performed well in this match and Rasheed Khan, other Afghans, performed well in IPL this year. And I remember that Afghan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani had tagged me and wrote on his Twitter that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rasheed represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is the world's asset of cricket and he also wrote in a very funny manner that we should not give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match, so it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for a special reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the entire world.
He did what a winning team could do while taking the trophy.
During the trophy, the Afghan team, which was playing international matches for the first time, invited the Afghan team and photographed the two teams.
What is the spirit of Sportsman Spirit, what is the spirit of Sportsmanship - we can feel it by an incident.
Sports is a very good solution to unite the society and to find out the talent that is in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan teams.
I hope that we will play with each other in the same way as well as play with the entire Sportsman Spirit.
My dear countrymen, this is the fourth yoga day on 21st June.
The whole world fell at once.
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels or the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese naval warships, everywhere people were seen doing yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic Yoga programme and I was told that women did the demonstration of many asanas.
On the high Burfila peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers together practiced Yoga.
Yoga works to break all the boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went beyond all forms of discrimination, caste, religion, region, colour or sex and made this occasion a very big festival.
If people from all over the world were enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why should not it be multiplied in India
It is a matter of pride for the country when 1. 25 billion people see that the security forces of our country have studied Yoga in all the three places of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.
When some brave soldiers performed yoga somewhere in Sabarina, some soldiers performed yoga on the snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force, in the middle of the sky, at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth, confronted everyone with Yoga.
The observation was that they did not sit in the air but did Yoga in the air.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or fields of sports, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A sight of Ahmedabad had touched the heart.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters established the world wisdom by performing Yoga together at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a wellness, revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from yoga will move forward.
Most people will make it a part of their lives.
Several people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that I would like to talk about Doctors Day on 1st July this year at Mann Ki Baat.
We remember the doctor in difficult times, but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them very much for their service and dedication towards society.
We are those who worship the Mother as God, who believe in God, who gives us life.
When mother gives birth to us, sometimes the doctor gives us birth again.
The role of a doctor is not limited to treating diseases only.
Today doctors not only have medical expertise but they also have a lot of experience about the impact that affects our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills.
In the Medical Profession, along with Maharath, Hardwarking, our doctor is also known for solving the complex medicinal problems.
With the passing away of Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all our doctors on behalf of every Indian.
My dear countrymen, we are such fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a prosperous history when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no shortage of any historical event.
If you see, every place in India has its own heritage.
There are some saints, some great man, some famous person, everybody contributes to his own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you would be aware of Gujarat's Kabirvad.
When I used to work there, I had done a very big national conference of people associated with the tradition of a Saint Kabir.
Do you know why Kabirdas Ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who die in Maghar do not go to heaven.
The body that sacrifices in Kashi with this goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered indiscriminate but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same evils and superstitions of his time and therefore he went to Maghar and saluted them there.
Saint Kabir Das ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his testimonies and talents.
It was their ideals.
We see these ideals in their creations and in today's era it is equally inspiring.
One of his pairs is: - Kabir Soi Pir Hai, if you don't know the pains of others, if you don't know the pains of others, then I don't know the sufferings of others.
Kabir Das ji laid special emphasis on social harmony.
He used to think far ahead of his time.
At a time when the time of conflict and struggle was going on in the world, he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked to remove differences of opinion by bringing people together.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the betterment of the society.
A system of cooking free from social discrimination where every caste, sect, religion or community can come and eat and only Guru Nanak Dev had started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I also urge you people to think about the way Guru Nanak Dev Ji celebrates it on the 550th Prakash Parv throughout the society and around the world, new ideas, new ideas, new imaginations, new ideas and new ideas.
India's struggle for independence is very long, very broad, it is full of innumerable martyrdoms.
There is a history associated with Punjab.
The terrible incident of Jalianwala Bagh in 2017 is also completing 100 years, which has embarrassed humanity.
Who can forget the dark day of April 13, 11 when pills were fired on innocent, armless and muscular people crossing all limits of cruelty using power.
The victory is always peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on Narendra Modis mobile app that the next 6th July will be Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mookerjee is the birth anniversary of Dr.
Talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji first thank you very much.
I was very happy to see your cottage in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields but the areas that were closest to him were education, administration and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would be aware that the youngest Vice Chancellor of Kolkata University was a Vice Chancellor.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed Convocation at Kolkata University in Bangladesh.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense he had laid a strong foundation stone for India and industrial development, had built a strong base, had developed a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of India, which came into being in 1948, brought out the print of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee dreamt that India should be industrially self-reliant, efficient and prosperous in every sector.
He wanted India to develop large industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All IndiaHandloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were set up between 148 to 150 for better development of Kutir and Small Enterprises.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had a huge contribution.
He was extremely dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
As a result of their understanding, wisdom and activity, a part of Bengal can be saved and today it is a part of India.
Dr.
Remembering the message of unity of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, let us keep connected with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood for the progress of India.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
I got the opportunity to know directly about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people ahead of the files.
People talked about their resolve, their happiness and their achievements.
Girls in far-flung villages are providing services ranging from pension to passports to old people through common service centres.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects sitaffalo and does business by making it ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
I don't know how many things were there in the country, there would be no such thing in the country where people didn't talk about their success.
In such a situation, when ordinary people bring about new hopes, new zeal and incidents that have taken place in their lives then it is not the pride of the government.
Even a small girl from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant and inspiring and it not only gives me satisfaction to work but it also gives me the courage to do more work.
There is a new joy, a new zeal and a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and you have given me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then something is good somewhere or the other.
There are people who do good.
We can also experience the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing came to my mind and it is a unique combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming.
Now you will be wondering what is the relation between these two very different businesses
However, in Bengaluru, corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together to build a comfortable prosperity trust and they have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
He joined the farmers and made arrangements and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today they are not only generating vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through the trust.
Farmers who produce cereals are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of farmers in profits.
I thank these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have taken the path of connecting the farmers with the villages and connecting them with the fields.
Once again, I might have noticed some of his innovative experiments to the young generation of my country. Some people might be aware, some may not be aware, but crores of people are doing something good.
GST is going to complete one year.
The dream of the people of the country One Nation, One Tax has changed in reality today.
One Nation, One Tax Reform, if I have to give credit to anyone for this thing then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took decisions in the country and then such a huge tax reform was implemented in the country.
So far, two meetings of GST Council have been held and we all can take pride that the people of different political systems sit there, the people of different states sit there, the states with different priority but in addition to this, all the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken with unanimous consent.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST but now only one tax has been implemented in the entire country.
GST is a victory for integrity and a festival of integrity.
Earlier, there were frequent complaints of Inspector Raj in the tax case in the country.
With the introduction of GST check posts have been stopped and the movement of goods has accelerated, which not only saves time but also benefits from the logistics sector.
GST may be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a large tax reform in India has been successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST can be ensured only through manpower.
It is generally believed that such a big report, such a large country, such a large number of people takes five to five years to stabilize them completely. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the country's honesty is the result of the participation of the people in the peoples power that within a year this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and has also improved it through its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
It has been dedicated to the nation by 1. 25 billion Indians.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for Mann Ki Baat, to meet you, to talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
Once again I have got the opportunity to be present before you through Mann Ki Baat.
You would be well aware of the fact that a group of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama ji, I would like to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their teams have returned to India on 21st May after travelling to INSV Tarini for more than a quarter of a day and welcomed them very warmly.
He travelled across various oceans, and many seas, cut a distance of about twenty-two thousand nautical miles.
This was the first such incident in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and hear their experiences.
If we want to visit the development journey of mankind, progress has emerged from somebody's adventure.
In the past, you must have seen that some new things have been taken into account about those who were roaming on the Mount Everest and for centuries Everest has been challenging the human race and brave people have also been adopting that challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhurve, Pramash Ale, Umakanth Madvi, Kavidas Kathode, Vikas Soyam, surpassed one of our tribal children at the top of the world.
I heartily congratulate the people of Chandrapur, my young friends and my heartiest congratulations.
Recently, the 16-year-old Shivangi Teacher became the youngest Indian woman to do Everest on behalf of Nepal.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest became the first Indian father-son to do so.
It is not that only the youth are cheating Everest.
Music snatched Everest on May 1 and the age of music is more than 50.
There are also some people who have chewed on Everest who have not only skills but also sensitivities.
For years people have been cheating Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave hearts, especially daughters and daughters.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, just a couple of months ago, when I had talked about Fit India, I did not think that it would have such a good effect.
Such a large number of people from all walks of life will come forward in their support.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
People are sharing fitness challenges on social media, tagging each other and challenging them.
Today everybody is joining this campaign of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world, the common people of the country, the army personnel, the school teachers, all around the world, there is a buzz - Hum Fit to India Fit.
It is a matter of happiness for me that Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team has given me the challenge and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and this kind of challenge will encourage us to keep fit and fit others.
Chhavi Yadav Ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the games that used to be a part of the lives of every child, the streets and the streets are going to be lost today.
These games were specially part of summer vacations.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
It is outside the house and inside the house as well.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports.
The same game is known by different names instead of different names.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
It is played with baskets or baskets or baskets of Ambali and with square board of 88.
This game was played in almost every state.
We also played this game.
Who among us has not played Moi Dandiya in childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) is a game ranging from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Udisha it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitidalu.
Some sports had their own climate.
Like there is a climate of kite flying.
When all of us play kites, we can demonstrate the unique qualities that we have in us.
You must have seen that many kids are adolescent but they are very cheerful while playing.
They express themselves, the big ones who seem to be serious, the child who is hiding in them during the game comes out.
Traditional sports are in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our reasonable thinking, concentration, awareness and understanding also increases.
When everyone plays from children to grandparents, grandparents and grandparents then what is called the Pecha is called the Generation Gap.
Many sports also make us aware about society, environment etc.
Today, it is important that schools, branches, youth groups etc. come forward and promote these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can make a huge archive of our traditional sports.
My dear countrymen, the next five years, our country will officially host the World Environment Day celebrations.
This is an important achievement for India and it is a testimony to Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you to understand the spirit of this theme and its importance, to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wild life and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018, and many suggestions have been given there in a very interesting manner - look, know and try to get them out of their daily lives.
Whenever there is extreme heat, there is a flood, it does not take the name of stopping rains, if there is unbearable cold, then every person talks about global warming, climate change, but what is the use of this thing
In the last few weeks, we have seen that there has been dust-borne rains in different parts of the country along with heavy winds.
There was also loss of lives and damage.
All these things are essentially the result of the changes in the climate.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to struggle with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi did this in a fashion by following his life-long debacle.
When India played a leading role in the CoP21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, it was a spirit of realising Mahatma Gandhis dream in all its roots.
On this environment day, let us all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
Monsoon is about to come. We can aim to plant trees this time not only to plant trees but also to conserve them until they grow up.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You remember the 21st of June, not only you, but the entire world remembers the 21st of June.
21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
Presently, there are reports that in the whole world, preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga for Unity and Harmonius Society is a message that the world has repeatedly experienced in the past few years.
By doing yoga, courage is born which protects us like a simple father.
A feeling of forgiveness arises as mothers are for their children and mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
Bharatuhari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, our sisters, our self-respecting brothers, the earth itself becomes our bed and our knowledge becomes hungry.
When all these qualities become a partner, Yogi tries to overcome all kinds of threats.
Once again I appeal to the countrymen to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation ahead of our heritage of Yoga.
Today is 2nd May, the first Indian Prime Minister is the death anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
This month of May is also related to another thing and it is Veer Savarkar.
It was my month in 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were determined to demonstrate their bravery against injustice.
Sadly, for a very long time, we have been calling the 185 incidents a revolt or a sepoy revolt.
In fact, if this incident was observed in an observational manner, it was also an attempt to push our self-respect.
He was a brave Savarkar who devoted himself to writing that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but the first fight for freedom.
The heroes of India House in London, including Savarkar, celebrated its 50th anniversary with pomp and show.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month in which the freedom struggle started before independence.
Savarkar jis personality was full of specialties
He was a favourite of both arms and sciences.
Generally, Veer Savarkar is known for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj, but apart from that, he was also an enlightened poet and social reformer who always emphasized on solidarity and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has made a wonderful description of Savarkar ji.
Atal ji had done a solid portrait.
Savarkar carried both poetry and revolution together.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters who were compelled to demand from household to household waste, today they are dressing up to cover the poor by learning the work of sewing.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and confidence, for their bright future.
He has demonstrated that if you are determined to do something then success can be achieved even in the midst of all difficulties.
And that is not just about Sikar but you will see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the problem then it will be taken care of how people solve the problems.
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people present here.
These discussions are of politics, of social, of movies, of sports and sportspersons as well as of the problems of the country. It should be resolved in such a way that most of these things are confined to discussions only but some people are those who move forward in the direction of bringing about change with their work, hard work and perseverance.
Shriman D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling their lives with education.
He opened a school called ASHA ASHASHASAN for children living in huts, which costs 50 of their income by selling poor tea.
It provides education, health and food to all the children coming to the school.
I am D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his relationship and for giving a new direction to the lives of the poor.
He has struck the darkness of his life.
Who does not know this version of Thaso Ma Jyotirgamy, but has shown it alive.
Prakash Rave.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and the entire nation.
There will be a series of such inspiring events around you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Let us pursue positiveness.
In the month of June, there is so much heat that people wait for rain and in the hope of looking at the blue sky in the sky.
People will also wait for the moon after a few days from today.
The meaning of seeing the moon is that Eid can be considered.
After a month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Id is the beginning of celebration.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate Id with full zeal and especially children will get a better reward on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were organized in Australia from April 4 to April 15.
One countries of the world, including India, participated in it.
When such a big event is being organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world can imagine how the atmosphere would be.
Responsibilities, emotions, enthusiasm, hopes, aspirations and aspirations - when there is such an atmosphere, who can keep it away from himself.
Our sportspersons also performed well on the hopes of the countrymen and won a medal after one.
Then be it shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has performed records.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze India won around 66 Medles.
This success makes every Indian proud.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for the medal winners.
It is a festival of great pride for all the countrymen.
Perhaps the words will also diminish to express this feeling.
But I want to ask you what I have heard from these players.
That is, there were many things this time, which happened for the first time.
Do you know that the number of wrestlers that India has won in the Commonwealth Games this time, all the medals have been won.
Manika Batra won medals in all the events that Manika Batra took.
This is the first Indian woman to win India a gold medal in the Individual Table Tennis.
India has the largest medals shooting.
Sachen Chaudhari is the only Indian Para Power-lifter to win medals in Commonwealth Games.
This time the games were special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, shooting, women sportspersons have done wonders.
In Badminton, two Indian players Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
Sindhu was in the middle.
The athletes participating in the Games came from different parts of the country, from small towns.
His friends also contribute to their courage in every situation.
I congratulate all of them along with those sportspersons.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had called for Fit India with my countrymen, especially with our youth and I had invited everyone to join Fit India and lead Fit India.
A gentleman, Smt. Shashikant Bhonsle has written in a swimming pool sharing one of his photographs: My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel myself happy and healthy from the morning walk.
And it further says: "For me-fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy."
There is no doubt that Happiness is the only fitness.
Cine actor Akshay Kumar has put a video on the Twitter.
Many other youngsters have also shared their experiences by connecting with Fit India efforts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
The International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been accepted by the entire world.
You should also prepare from now on.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been told is getting very popular.
My young friends, you will now come out of the dizziness of exams, exams and exams and you will start worrying about holidays.
How to celebrate holidays, where to go
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to revive and experience life away from computers through paper-colum.
My young friends, today I urge you for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, HRD or Department of Drinking Water, have jointly launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
The college students, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendra who want to do something for the society, the country and the country, the changes in the society, the desire to add oneself to the changes in the society, the desire to do something in the society, the desire to do something in the society with a positive energy, this is an opportunity for all of them and this will also strengthen cleanliness and when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be happy to do something before and I will also tell you that those who have done good work in the college, they will be given the award at the national level.
Each intern who successfully completes this internship will be given a certificate by Swachh Bharat Mission.
Moreover, the interns that will finish it very well, the UGC will also give them two credit points.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this thing for internships.
You can go to MyGov app and register for the SwachhBharatSummer Internship.
I hope that our youth will further strengthen this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
Your parents are required to send stories, send photos, send videos.
Let us make this holiday an opportunity to learn for a new experience.
I have seen in the past that I have been talking about the youth of Delhi who are feeling selfless for the education of poor children.
This campaign, which started from 15 children in huts near Gita Colonies in Delhi, has now joined 2 thousand children at 12 locations in the capital.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this campaign are engaged in this concerted effort to bring about a free time of 2 hours out of their busy schedule.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
Their organised efforts have changed not only their own but also their own fate.
In Bageshwar of Uttarakhand mainly crops of ragi , rajgra , maize or barley are found .
Being a hilly area, farmers could not get the right value.
However, instead of selling the crop directly into the market, the farmers of Capkot Taluka adopted the path of value addition and adopted the path of value addition.
He started making biscuits from the same product and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munar village and have also started a biscuit manufacturing factory there.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being delivered to not only about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kasir.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached not only Rs. 10-15 lakhs but at the same time, more than 100 families have also been forced to go out of the district after getting employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that the world is going to fight with water in the future.
Everyone says this, but do we have any responsibility or not
Do we not think that conservation of water should be a social responsibility 
Our ancestors have lived up to centuries.
He gave priority to one drop of water supplies.
They have discovered new ways to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system, drought management have been written in the big temples.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilapatti or Pudukottai, you will get to see large arts everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must go to Jodhpur for Chand Bau.
It is one of India's largest and most beautiful plants and it is worth noting that it is in the region where there is water scarcity.
April, May, June, July is such a time that there is an excellent opportunity to collect rain water and if we make preparations in Advanced then we get the same benefit.
The MNREGA budget also works for the conservation of this water.
During the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management from the MNREGA budget every year.
Talking about 2017-18, I have been spending about 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64 thousand crore, that is, about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation.
Over the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted in large quantities through water conservation and water management measures.
The MGNREGA budget for water conservation and water management has immensely benefitted some people.
Thousands of people working on the river Kuttumperur in Kerala revived the river by working hard for 70 days.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-filled rivers but there are some areas in Uttar Pradesh like two small rivers named Sasur Khadari of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district system has intensified a large number of soil and water conservation works under MNREGA.
With the help of the people of nearly 40-45 villages, this simple Khadrei river, which had dried up, was revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, such a big blessing is this success.
I would like to say that once again April, May, June, July, let us take some responsibility for water conservation and water conservation.
When there is Mann Ki Baat, I get messages from all sides, papers and phone calls.
Ayankumar Banerjee of Devitola village of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written in her comment on MyGov. We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti everywhere but many people do not know about the philosophy of the Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's pessimism, beauty and integrity.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, discuss the subject so that people can know about it.
I thank Ayyanji for drawing the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a person full of wisdom and wisdom, whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a brilliant personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but one of his teachers could experience it every moment.
He wrote, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibilities to impart it to the students.
I don't know Bengali language, but when I was young, I was used to getting up early - from childhood and from the eastern India radio starts very fast.
When the delays start in western India, I guess in the morning, it was probably the beginning of Rabindra Sangeet at 5:30 in the morning.
I used to get used to listening to Rabindra's music early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems of Anandalok and Agunar and Poreshmoni.
You must have influenced Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full respect and respect all over the world.
The social aspect of everyday is that when a person is very hungry, he feels hungry for another.
When he is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to recall the teachings and messages of Pyagambar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to walk from their lives on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a person asked Paigambar Saheb, what is the best thing in Islam
Pyagambar Saheb said, Feeding a poor and needy person and meeting everyone with goodwill, irrespective of what you know.
He believed in wisdom and compassion.
He was not arrogant about anything.
He used to say that arrogance defeats knowledge.
Payagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have more than any goods, then give it to a needy person, that is why there is a lot of importance in Ramzan.
People contribute to the needy in this sacred month.
Payagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is absorbed by his soul with purity, not by wealth and oppression.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcased the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions all over the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of remembering Lord Buddha, trying to follow his path, making a solemn pledge.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values that require the highest in the world today.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar emphasised that his social philosophy is inspired by Lord Buddha.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people who were oppressed, exploited and deprived by the Constitution.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion.
This compassion for the suffering of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries, they used to take along with themselves the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and it has been happening all the time.
Throughout Asia, we have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha.
This tradition of Buddha is associated with the teachings of Buddha in many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar. And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which connects important places of South-East Asia to the special Buddhist destinations of India.
I am also happy to note that the Government of India has participated in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old magnificent Anand Mandir in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is a feeling of intimidation and humanitarian pain, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to eradicate hatred from grace.
I wish Buddha Purnima to all those who believe in the principles of compassion that have spread all over the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is said that laughing brings good luck but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defence history.
You would be wondering what is the relationship between smiling Buddha and the military power of India
You might remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May 18, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, addressed the nation and his words filled the nation with pride, valour and happiness.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1988, a nuclear test was conducted on the western side of India, Rajasthan.
Indias test was successful and, in a way, India showcased its strength in science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as an exhibition of its military power in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has told the world that inner strength, inner strength and inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you are strong as a country, you can be peaceful with everyone.
The month of May 18 is not important for the country only because nuclear tests were conducted in this month, but the way it was done is important.
It showcased the entire world that Indias land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given a mantra: Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ji.
In view of this, we can also derive a new joy and a new satisfaction to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat, I will talk about more.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the auspicious festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life.
In the past 26 January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were present here, they had brought a cultural troop with them and it is a matter of great pride that most of these countries were presenting Ramayana in front of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing so much inspiration and influence not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time too, I have received all your letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakkarji wrote about the online correspondence of Sanskrit on MyGov.
Besides being an IT professional, I was very happy to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I would also urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work in the context of Sanskrit to think about what can be done in the context of the suggestions of Kamalji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar, you read the comments on NarendraModiApp.
The concern that you have expressed at the ground level is very important.
Shastri ji, Karnataka.
You have requested all to keep water for the animals in the summer summer season.
Kalji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that I talk to the youth about their health this time.
They feel that our youth is physically weak in comparison to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we talk to everyone in detail about health - Fit India.
And all the youngsters will be able to run the movement of Fit India.
During his visit to Kashi, French President, Varanasi, Shri Prashant Kumar has written that all the visions of this visit were touching, impressing.
And he urged them to publish all the photos, all the videos on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put those photos on social media and narendraModiApp on that very day.
Now, please lick them and retweet them, send your friends.
Andha, Jayesh and a lot of children from Chennai have written to me about the Gratitude Cards behind the book Exam Warrior.
Andha, Jayesh, I would like to tell you all the children that the tiredness of my day is over by your letters.
All these letters, all these phone calls, comments, whatever I have read from them, all these things have been heard and many of these things have touched my mind. Even if I talk about them only then perhaps for months I will have to say something continuously.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about examinations.
He has mentioned about his plans for holidays.
In the summer heat, we are worried about water for the animals.
Farmers' brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities being carried out across the country in the context of Kisan Melas and Farming.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed during the festivals.
It means that the words of our mind also change with the seasons and perhaps it is also true that the words of our mind change the season of life of somebody else.
And why not
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples, all the inspirations, all the energy, all the spirituality and the country have the courage to do something.
It has the power to change the weather of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, has built new schools for poor children through his will power, then this country's indomitable will power is visible.
In his mission, he sold household loans and collected money through donations.
Several visitors who travelled in his cab gave generous donations.
An engineer daughter gave her own initiatives
Thus, after 12 years of collection of Rupees, Sadul Laskar brought the color of his efforts and today due to his hard work, due to his own resolve, he is ready to become a 30-bedded hospital in Punari village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, the perspective of India has changed all over the world.
Today, in every section of the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, this belief has been raised that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
A positive atmosphere of confidence filled with hope and aspirations has been created.
This self-confidence, this positiveness will fulfil our resolve and dream of a New India.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That is why many letters have come in the context of agriculture.
This time I also saw the video of the discussions with the farmers on the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and I feel that every farmer should connect with this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and should look at the experiments in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and general public life of the country.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji reiterated the need for conservation of plants, trees and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia also spoke of massive public awareness for ensuring better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and all of them and enhancing food and milk production.
In his address in 1971, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji insisted on the need for farmers to use new technology and innovation.
I had gone to the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi in the past.
My interactions with the farmer brothers and sisters and scientists there, knowing, understanding and innovation related to agriculture was a pleasant experience for me but what I was most impressed was the hard work of the people of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This low-level state has done a very big job.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have made record production over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has demonstrated that when the goal is determined, the determination is strong and there is a resolve in the mind, it can be proved and demonstrated.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is being supported by the technology, which is giving a lot of strength to the agricultural producer.
In the letters that I have received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the spirit and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, This year a big decision has been taken in the budget to provide fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that the price for the notified crops will be announced at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the villages with Wholesale Market and then with the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far enough to sell their produce. For this, 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded with the required intermediaries to connect with APMC and e-NAM platform.
That is, in a way, a system of direct connectivity of any market of the country with the fields is being created.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is not only our resolve but also how can we pay our best tributes to Gandhiji by taking a dignified account of crores of Indians
How can new trends be respected for this
I appeal to you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
Inform you about the slogan or mantra or proclamation.
We all together pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him to take our country to new heights.
Thank you, you are right and I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are both complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a systematic approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Health Ministry only when all the departments and ministries, be it Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Women Child Development or State Governments are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with affordable health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more aware we will be for the preventive healthcare, the more it will benefit the individuals, the family and the society.
To make life healthy, there is a need for cleanliness.
As a result of this, sanitation coverage has doubled to nearly 80 in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level to create health wellness centres across the country.
This is the result of all of us's commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This time the International Day of Yoga has saved less than 100 days for 21st June.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and around the world took part in a lot of enthusiasm.
This time too we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and all for Yoga from now on.
Yoga has to be popularized in children, in the youth, in the elderly, in all the age groups, men or women in a very interesting way.
Though the country's TV and electronic media do different programmes in terms of Yoga during the year, but can we create awareness about Yoga in the form of a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need a Yoga Practice but some people have also made me a Yoga teacher through their creativity and made me a 3D Animated Video by doing Yoga.
I will share that video with all of you so that we can practice asanas, pranayama along with us.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that health care is within reach and nutritional, affordable and accessible to the common man.
Heart stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The number of MBBS meetings has been increased to about 68 thousand in the prevailing 4 medical colleges in the country.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
All of us will see a collective effort to get rid of B.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For them, the industry was an effective medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the Make in India campaign is successfully running in the country, Dr.
Today, the vision of Ambedkar ji who had dreamt of India as an industrial power is an inspiration for us.
Today, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the global economy and today the world's largest foreign direct investment FDI is coming to India.
The whole world is seeing India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
It was the idea that the growth of industries would be possible only in the cities that led to Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on urbanization of India.
He did not want any person to lead his life in poverty.
At the same time, he believed that poverty cannot be eliminated by just sharing something among the poor.
Today Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways in the 1930s and 1940s when only roads and railways were being talked about in India.
It is Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as the power of the nation.
He emphasized on the use of water for the development of the country, various river valley authorities, various water related commissions - this was the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on various sea shores of India and inter-market is being strengthened at old ports.
During the decade of the 40s, most of the discussions took place in the context of the Second World War, the Cold War and the Summit.
Ambedkar in a way laid the foundation stone of Team India Spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism, and stressed on working together with the Union and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance, and most importantly, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me who are associated with the backward classes.
He has demonstrated that it is not necessary for us to move forward that no one is born in a big or poor family, but those born in the poor families of India can also dream of, can try to fulfil their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it has also been made that many people have paid tributes to Dr.
We tried to push them back, we made every possible effort to ensure that the daughters of poor and backward families are not able to move forward, nothing can happen, nothing can be achieved in their lives.
But the image of a New India is completely different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Under this, there will be separate programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this mission with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to be held in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, it is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life philosophy of Ahimsa's messenger Lord Mahavir ji will inspire us all.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
The discussion of Easter reminds us of the inspiring teachings of Lord Jesus Christ who has conveyed the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to the common man.
In April, when we celebrate the festival of Vaisakhi in Punjab and West India, Judashital and Satuvan in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will be joyous and joyous in these days.
All these festivals are somehow linked to our farming sectors and grain providers, through these festivals, we thank nature for the invaluable gifts that we produce.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, today Namaskar begins with a phone call Mann Ki Baat.
Several questions related to science have been asked by my young friends.
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought whether it is river or sea, why water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes in front of us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light skating.
One of his discoveries is known as 'Raman Effect'.
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year as it is said that the day was discovered about the event of light skating for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great scholars Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Arya Bhatt on the other hand, the sushrita and charaka are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the famous particle Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to be present at a function in Mumbai for the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the underprivileged or the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help in making the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can Artificial Intelligence help in making healthcare affordable and modernizing diseases
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to attend the inauguration of the I Create in Ahmedabad.
There, a young man has developed a digital infrastructure that if someone cannot speak, he is in a dialogue with the help of infrastructure and he can interact in the same way as a speaker interacts.
I understand that we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology values are boundless.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do what we want.
But, it depends on us what we want to do with machines.
Human inspiration becomes important here.
Use of science for the welfare of mankind, to attain the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Adison, who invented light bulbs, failed several times in his experiments.
It is a coincidence that today I am in the workplace of Maharishi Arabic at Oroville.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, as a great saint, he questioned every aspect of his life.
We searched for answers and waited for humanity.
It is important to ask questions again and again to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my greetings to all our scientists and scientists.
My best wishes are to inspire our young generation to discover truth and knowledge and to inspire us to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, During the crisis, several times I get a lot of messages about security and disasters, people keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Ravindra Singh spoke on the subject of Occupational Safety in his comment on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that safety parameters on factory and construction sites in our country are not good.
As India is the National Safety Day on March 4, the Prime Minister spoke of safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme, to increase awareness about security among the people.
When we talk about public security, two things are very important - one proactiveness and the other preperatedness.
Safety is of two types - one that is required in time, safety during disastrous and the other that is required in day to day life.
If we are not aware of security in our daily lives, we cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
We have often read the boards written on the roads, it says that there is a lack of awareness, a loss due to accidents, a loss due to sneaking happily, do not leave the world swiftly, do not do any fun with the security of the brethren, the lives of the people are cheaper and these words are never used in our lives.
If we are cautious, if we follow the necessary rules, we can protect our lives, but we can use the society with great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that there are several sources of safety at the work place but whenever we want, we cannot follow it anywhere.
I urge the municipalities who have fire brigades to go to different schools once in a week or once in a month to send them to school children.
Fear Brigade will also have a habit of being alert and a new generation also gets its teachings and does not have any expense - in a way there is a sequence of teaching.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the country in trade management.
Aapada Mitra has also been initiated to train volunteers in flood-related cyclone-related districts.
Training and awareness have a very big role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to loot-heatwave.
Thereafter, NDMA has organised workshops for prevention of hives, campaigns to create awareness among the people.
A good result came out with the participation of all.
The death toll in 2017 was surprisingly reduced to nearly 20.
It can be observed that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, be it social organisation or be it awakening citizens, I want to address those people who are in trouble, who are engaged in relief and rescue operations within Mintoes.
And the number of such misappropriation heroes is no less.
(BIMSTEC) A Joint Disaster Management Exercise of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal was one of the first and largest humanitarian experiments.
We have to become a risk-conscious society.
In our culture, we always talk about preservation of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
What did it mean that there was a system to provide information
Because we are not conscious of nature and for this we hear our ears after sitting in the air, but none of us feels that this suggestion is for me.
The same experience is in every sphere of our lives.
We should not think that Safety is for anyone else, if all of us become conscious of our safety, then the spirit of social security is also included in us.
The objective of the GobarDhan scheme is to clean the villages and generate wealth and energy by converting solid waste of animals into compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China use cow dung and other biological wastes of animals to produce energy, but India does not have the full potential.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving in this direction.
The target is to use Dhorna Gobar, Agricultural Waste, Cooking Household Waste to generate biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, in rural India, farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged to look at Gobar and waste as not just waste but as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase.
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy matters for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and livestock will be helpful in increasing the income.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will also be created to facilitate the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers can get the right price for Gobar and Agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating cooperative societies by making self help groups.
I invite you to become a partner in the movement of Clean Energy and Green jobs, to convert waste into wealth in your village and to make Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, we have been listening to the music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, wherein the first garbage festival was organised in the state.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the various ways of creating awareness about cleanliness and creating awareness about the city's waste.
During this festival, various activities took place, ranging from students to the elderly, all of them participated.
Different types of artifacts were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
Music performance was done on the theme of cleanliness and Art work was done.
Inspired by Raipur, there were different types of garbage festivals in other districts too.
Innovative ideas, discussions and poetry were read about cleanliness initiated by each one of them.
In the context of cleanliness, an atmosphere like a festival was created.
The manner in which schoolchildren participated enthusiastically was wonderful.
I congratulate the Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative exhibition of the importance of waste management and cleanliness in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is also being honoured by women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past.
On this occasion, I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women power has introduced self-confidence and self-confidence with their actions.
He has not only enhanced himself but also worked to take the country and the society forward and take them to a new destination.
This is the dream of our New India where women are empowered, strong and are equal partners in the overall development of the country.
In the past, a very beautiful suggestion was made to me by a great personality.
He suggested that there are several programmes to celebrate Women's Day on March 8, which can be honoured by the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village-city.
I was wondering if I could talk about a long life in it and I was sending it to you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women and 15 lakh women have organized a one-month cleanliness drive.
Beginning 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
Can you imagine how big this event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan in the normal life and the culture of cleanliness into the habit of the masses.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and there is a lot of joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all are well aware that Elephanta Island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big tourist destination, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, the darkness in the lives of the people of Rajbander, Morabandar and Sethbandar, three villages of Elephanta Island, has now become dark and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that now the caves of Elephanta village and Elephanta will be lighted with electricity.
This is not just an electricity but a new beginning of the thread of development.
What could be the moment of satisfaction and happiness more than that if the lives of the countrymen are illuminated, there is happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now this is the unique feature of the month of March, the golden emergence of the joyful gardening fields of ripening crops and the splendor of the mazar who shook his heart.
But all of us are very fond of this month's Holi festival.
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi with fervor.
The importance of Holi is as important as Holika Dahan because this day is a day to burn evils in the fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all the sorrows, to participate in each other's happiness and happiness and convey the message of love unity and brotherhood.
Greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the festival of democracy with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history, the heads of ten countries were present in this event.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written that the imagination of going to the space on 1st February is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Colombia Spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youngsters from all over the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he started his long letter with the departure of Chawla.
It is sad for all that we lost imagination Chawla at such a young age, but he conveyed this message to thousands of women from all over the world, especially India, that there is no limit to women power.
It is impossible if there is a will and determination and a strong desire to do something.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women in India are progressing rapidly in every field and increasing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the dignity of women in our country, their place and their contribution in society has surprised the whole world.
Indian enemies have a long tradition.
Many of India's adversaries have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreya, there are many names.
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but centuries ago, in our classics, Scandpuran, it has been said: Dashuputra Sammelanya, Dashuputrana Pravardhana.
One daughter will get the same amount of money as the ten daughters get.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of Shakti.
This woman power binds the entire nation, the entire society, the family and the society together.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has given several other examples.
He has written that it is inspiring for our brave Defence Prime Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman to fly to the Sukoi-30 fighter aircraft.
He also mentioned that the Indian Navys women crew members, led by Vrika Joshi, are circumnavigating the globe on the INSV swimming.
Three brave women have become emotional stories, lions of Mohna and four-wheeler pilots of Awai and have been trained in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Capacity Vajpayee, All Women Crew flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and Port Delhi in the Air India Boeing Jet and all the ladies back.
In the past, Honble President has taken a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who had shown the first thing in their respective fields.
The first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman train driver of Passenger train, first woman firefighter, first woman bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, thus the first woman to reach Everest.
Our women powers have achieved extraordinary accomplishments by breaking the fundamentalism of the society.
He demonstrated that a new path can be drawn across all odds and obstacles on the strength of hard work, determination and determination.
A path that will inspire not only our contemporaries but generations to come.
We will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on insurance secretary, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire nation can know about these women powers, inspire them from their lives and works.
It is also available in the form of e-book on the NarendraModi website.
Today, women power of the country plays an important role in the positive transformation in the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment, you will be wondering what is the relationship between these two
Mumbai's Matunga station is India's first station with all women employees.
Whether it is a commercial department, a railway police, a ticket checker, an entrepreneur, a point person or a staff of more than 40 employees are among the women in all departments.
This time many people, after watching the Republic Day Parade, wrote on Twitter and on other social media that one of the main features of the parade was the BSF Biker Continent, in which alumni were participating.
He was experiencing courageous experiments and was also surprised by the visitors from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our Nirman Shakti is leading.
When we talk about tribal women then a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are jungles, footsteps, on which the wooden boxes of sticks are raised on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new image in front of the country.
The Dantewada region of Chattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, has created a terrible atmosphere of violence, Bombay, Bunduk, Pistol and Maoists.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a dangerous area by running an e-rickshaw.
In a short span of time, a lot of women have joined it.
And three benefits are being made. On the one hand, while self-employment has been done to empower them, on the other hand, the image of Maoism-affected area is changing.
And it is also strengthening the work of environmental conservation.
Over the centuries against social evils and evils, continuous efforts have been made at the individual and social level in our country.
Just a few days ago, Bihar had taken an interesting initiative.
The worlds longest human chain of more than 13,000 kilometers was built to eradicate social evils from the roots of the state.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the evils like child abuse and dowry practices.
The entire state took a pledge to fight against evils such as dowry and child marriage.
Young people, mothers, sisters, all of them had participated in this gathering.
The human chain, which began from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, continued to join the borders of the State.
It is essential that our society should be free from these evils so that all the people of the society get the benefit of development in the true sense.
Let us all together take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain who has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative in the direction of social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of Mysore and Karnataka has written on MyGov: The cost of medicines used to be Rs. 6000 per month on the treatment of his father.
Earlier, he did not know about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendra.
But now when they got information about Jan AushadhiKendras and purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines has come down to 5.
He wished me to talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that the maximum number of people can know about it and benefit from it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about it.
I have also seen several people on video and social media who have benefitted from this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information then it gives me great pleasure.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had the idea that he would get what he had received.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care Affordable and to promote Ease of Living.
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 70 of branded medicines available in the market.
This helps the masses, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday, to a great extent.
The generic medicines sold in it are of the standard of World Health Organisation.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for individual enterprises.
Affordable medicines are available on the Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only objective behind all this is to make the poorest of the poor affordable health service available so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mange from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo was such that my attention was drawn to the pictures.
The photo was such that a grandson along with his grandfather was participating in the cleanliness drive of Clean Morana river.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morana under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river flowed for the first 12 months but now it has become a seasonal one.
The other pain is that the river was completely filled with wild thunderstorms.
Significant waste was being put on the river and its banks.
Action Plan was prepared and one day before the Makar Sankranti, on 13th January, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morana, two sides of the Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of four kilometers.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this novel work of Mission Clean Mora.
This Swachhta programme was also continued on 20th January, 2018 and I was told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning till the river Mora is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible.
Large changes can be brought about through mass movements.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, to the administration of the district and municipal corporation, to all the citizens involved in making this work a mass movement for their efforts and this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to a lot of discussions about Padma Awards these days.
It is also attracted by the newspapers on this subject and on TV.
However, if you look at it carefully then it will be a matter of pride for you people that how great people are amongst us and it will naturally be proud to see how the common man in our country is reaching those heights without any emotion.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma Awards but the entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
Transparency has come due to online processing of the entire process.
In a way, the selection process of the awards has been completely transformed.
Now the significance of the award is not the identity of the person but the importance of his work is increasing.
You would be happy to know that Aurobindo ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, dedicated his entire life to making sports for children.
They are making rams from four decades of waste so that children can get more knowledge of science.
Their efforts are to inspire children to scientific experiments with unemployed items, for which they are going to three thousand schools across the country to inspire children by showing films made in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, how amazing dedication.
One such thing is that of Karnataka's Sitava Jordan.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades in Belagavi, he has contributed in transforming the lives of countless women.
He dedicated himself as a goddess at the age of seven, but later he spent his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Moreover, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Mr. Bhajju Shyam was born in an extremely poor family, tribal family.
He used to do ordinary work for life, but he was anxious to make traditional tribal images.
Today, due to this hobby, he is respected not only in India but in the whole world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who illuminated Indias name abroad, was recognised as Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised to hear about Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in hut made of leaves of palm in tribal areas amidst dense forests.
He has made five hundred hectares of medicinal plants based on his memory.
He added that snake charmers are making medicines to be used after biting.
Laxmiji is continuously serving the society with the knowledge of herbal medicines.
He was honored with Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by recognizing this missing person.
Subhashini Mistri is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other houses to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his wife died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated freely in their hard worked hospitals.
I am very confident that there are many such males in our multi-disciplinary Vasundhara whom no one knows or knows.
The Padma Awards are a medium, but I would also like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who are dedicated to the society around us, who have worked with some speciality and have to bring them in the middle of the society sometimes.
They do not work for dignity, but their work inspires us.
Sometimes people in schools, colleges and colleges should listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there should be some effort in the society as well.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the 9th January when the revered Mahatma Gandhi had travelled to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the unprecedented bonds between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized a programme that invites all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living around the world.
You will be happy to know that in this programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America and other countries where our original Indian mayor is there, all of them participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries, but also enjoying their strong relationship with India. This time I have sent the European Union to Candor, in which they have shown their contribution in diverse fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians who live in different countries of Europe, who are working in cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who donate their music to the minds of the society or somebody from their poems.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for doing RECOGNISE to the people of Indian origin and through them to inform the people of the world.
On 30th January, the venerable Bapus death anniversary has shown us a new path.
Even at present, we need every step that Bapu's words were right.
If we make a solemn pledge to walk on the path of Bapu, what can be a bigger tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you in 2018 and end my speech.
Mann Ki Baat December, 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and coincidence that today is also the last day of the year 2019.
We and you have shared a lot of things throughout this year.
This exchange of many of your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat always brings a new energy to me.
The year will change after a few hours, but this will continue even further.
In the coming year, we will do more innovative things, we will share new experiences.
Many congratulations to all of you on the occasion of 2018.
Recently, on the 25th of December, the Blue Festival was celebrated worldwide with auspiciousness.
In India too, people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recall the great teachings of Christ and Isha Christ, the most important thing that he emphasized was Sewabhav.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived his life on the basis of these values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior, worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against oppression and injustice.
He advised people to break the barriers of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave place to the spirit of hatred.
In every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace was his personality full of great features.
Let us take all our pledges and take inspiration from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singhji and from his inspirational life and strive to lead a life accordingly.
Those who were born in 2000 or after that will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century as New India voters.
I congratulate these youngsters and urge all of you to register as your voters.
The whole of India is keen to welcome you as a voter of the 21st century.
You will also be proud of the 21st century voters.
Your vote will become the basis of a New India.
The power of vote is the biggest power in democracy.
Mat is the most effective tool to bring about a positive change in the lives of lakhs of people.
You can also become the builder of the 21st century India and it has been started especially since January 1.
And today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to our valoured youngsters full of energy and determination for 18-25 years.
I believe that the talent and strength of our energy-loving youth will fulfil our dream of a New India.
When we talk of a New India, a New India free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Free from dirt and poverty.
New India - where there is equal opportunity for everyone, where everyones aspirations are fulfilled.
A New India where we have the inspiration of peace, unity and harmony.
May this New India Youth come forward and cherish how a New India will be created.
They will also set a path for themselves, connect them with whom they are associated and keep moving forward.
You should also move forward, the country should also move forward.
Today, when I am talking to you, I got an idea whether we can organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Where these 18-25-year-olds sit together and churn on a New India, find ways and make plans.
How can we realise our resolutions before 2022
How can we create an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the grand and grand India of the 21st century.
How to achieve success through resolution 
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to know about all these opportunities in one place and to create a system in this regard so that at the age of 18, they can easily understand all these things about the world and get the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about the importance of positiveness.
I am reminded of a shloka of Sanskrit. It means a man full of enthusiasm is very strong because nothing can be done beyond courage.
There is nothing impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People in English also say - Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share your positive moments of the year 2017 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am happy that a large number of people gave a very positive impression on the social media platform, MyGov and the NarendraModi App.
Lakhs of tweets were received along with Positive India Hashtag, which reached more than 1. 5 billion people.
In a way, the communication that took place in India spreads around the world.
The tweets and talents that came were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some of the countrymen have shared this year's programmes which had a special impact on their minds.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I talk to the bodels.
Our insurance had a premium of one rupee per month.
This was done by my husband and he died in an accident.
We should know what was our situation at that time.
With this help of the government, we benefited a lot and I could have a few meetings.
My name is Satisfaction Jadhav.
Our village has passed National Highway since 2019 from Bhinnar village.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and trade will also increase.
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Sahasanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bevan.
Our area had a problem of water and for the past 40 years we had to depend on the Armi pipeline.
Now this pipeline has been separately - free.
So all these great achievements are in our year 2017.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level which are bringing about a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we all are building together.
Let us enter the New Year with the happiness of these small ones, start the New Year and take a strong pitch towards Progressive India from Positive India.
When we talk about positiveness, I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiration of the poster Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak of the administrative service in Kashmir.
He has secured the first rank in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Service outside the brunt of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in the 10th century terrorists burnt their ancestral home.
There was so much terrorism and violence that their family had to leave their ancestral land.
For a small child, the atmosphere of so many violence around him was enough to create darkness and bitterness in his heart - but the fig did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of public service.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can also be dispersed through positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
When I was listening to them, they wanted to make progress in what field of life.
The time I spent with these daughters, I got inspiration too. This is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are discussions about the world's famous religious places, it is very natural to talk about the Sabrimala temple in Kerala.
Every year crores of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami in this world famous temple.
Where such a large number of devotees come, who have such a great importance, there is such a big challenge to maintain cleanliness there
And especially the place that lies between mountains and forests.
But Sabrimala Mandir is an example of how this problem can be transformed into a culture, how to find ways to get out of the problem and how powerful it is in public participation.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called 'Punyam Punkvanam' and started a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And this kind of tradition has been created that no travellers who come, their journey is not complete unless they do any physical work in the cleanliness programme.
There is no big or small in this campaign.
Every traveler, by understanding one part of the worship of God, gives us time for cleanliness, works and works to eliminate dirt.
Every morning, the scene of cleanliness is very unique and all the pilgrims get involved in it.
Be it a big CELEBRITY or be it a rich person or be it a big officer, every person becomes a part of this 'Punyama Punkavanam' programme just like a common traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhata Abhiyan in Sabrimala and Punya Punkavanam in it become a part of the journey of every traveler.
There, along with hard work, the hard work of cleanliness also works with it.
My dear countrymen, on October 2nd, 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we have resolved that the incomplete work of revered Bapu is Swachh Bharat, a dirt free India.
Respected Bapu continued to strive and strive for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we should do something in the direction of giving him the India of his dreams, a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Transformation is also visible in rural and urban areas with mass participation.
Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the achievements of sanitation level in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities in a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be examined in this survey, free from open defecation in cities, collection of garbage, transport system for lifting garbage, scientifically processing of waste, efforts made for behavioural change, capacity building and innovative efforts made for sanitation and public participation for this purpose.
During this survey, different teams will go and inspection the cities.
He will interact with citizens and respond to them.
The Swachhta App will be used and analysis of various types of services.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the nature of the people and the nature of the city.
Cleanliness should not be done by the government alone.
Every citizen and civil society association has a very big responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to enthusiastically participate in the Swachhta Survekshan in the days to come.
And don't leave your city behind, don't leave behind your lanes.
I am sure that the use of green and blue waste by separating dry wastes and wet wastes from homes would have become your habit now.
In the Swachhta Survekshan conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, you should not be left behind in this healthy competition of cleanliness. This should become a subject of public discussion in every city.
And all of you should have a dream of 'Amaru City- Our effort', 'Amariya Pragati' - the progress of the country.
Let us once again remind ourselves of the revered Bapu and take a pledge to make a Swachh Bharat, fulfil our motto.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that seem to be very small but are affecting our identity as a society far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
There is one thing in our knowledge that if a Muslim woman asks for a Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without 'Maharam' or her Male Guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time then I wondered how this could happen.
Who would have made such rules
Why should this kind of discrimination be there
And when I went into its depth then I got disturbed - even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who had such restoration.
For decades, there was no talk of injustice to Muslim women.
Even in many Islamic countries, this rule is not there.
But Muslim women in India did not get this right.
And I am happy that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has also taken these necessary steps and we have defeated this restriction by abolishing the tradition that has been going on for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without dignity and I am happy that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without dignity and women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to the North have expressed their desire to take Haj pilgrimage.
And I am confident that the development journey of India, the strength of our women power, their talents have moved forward and will continue to move forward.
We must constantly strive to ensure that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities for men to move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This time, on Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years in 2019 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present on 26th January with these great leaders of the ten countries of the world.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there would be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we all have considered Christmas and it is going to be a new year.
The new year will bring great happiness, happiness and prosperity for all of you.
Let us all move ahead with new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new resolve.
The month of January is the time for the sun to rise and Makar Sankranti is celebrated in this month itself.
Lohri is enjoyable in Punjab and North India and there is a wait for swimming and swimming in UP Bihar.
Every festival is special in itself and it has its own importance in Rajasthan, Magh-bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu.
Each festival is celebrated from 13th to 1st January.
The names of all these festivals are different, but their roots are only one link between nature and agriculture.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all on the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my countrymen.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that speaks with a lot of enthusiasm, younger brothers and sisters.
Listen to the fact that even in this phase of Ayushman Bharat, Lata Didi is eager for all the things related to the country. And the satisfaction of life is also in India's progress.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Pranam.
Modiji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday ...
When will you go and return
Modi ji: I will come back in the 28th late night and on the 2nd of the morning and then it will be your birthday.
Lataji: There are a lot of people in the age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of the big ones in their work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are a very old man in your age and you are a very old man in your work and you have achieved that by doing meditation and penance.
Lataji: Yes, I think my parents have blessings and the audience have a blessing.
I'm nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, today is your humility, it is a great education for all of our new generation.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after clevering so much in our lives, the culture and humility of your parents have always been a priority.
Lataji: G.
And I am glad that when you proudly say that your mother was Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you Laltaji: Give me something Gujarati.
I know that with your coming, the picture of India is changing and I am very happy with that.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see how busy you are and how much you are doing.
What do we have to think
When you visited your mother's discipline, I also sent someone to see her and took her blessings.
Modiji: Yes.
My father was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It will be my good fortune.
Modi ji: Pranam Dedi.
Your Excellency Lataji: My best wishes.
Modiji: Pranam G.
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new resolve.
Festivals are observed.
By the next several weeks, festivals will be celebrated across the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this scripture is not just a word, it is an order, a philosophy, an inspiration for all of us.
Some households have sweets, some households have sweets for sweets.
This is the darkness of the lamp.
The real joy of these festivals is when it is dark, this darkness is lightened.
We also share happiness where there is a lack of happiness and it also becomes our nature.
If there is a delivery of sweets, clothes and gifts in our homes then we should think of giving it to others for a moment.
Let us share such things in our households in large quantities, which we dont use in any other way.
In many cities, the start-ups of young friends of many NGOs are doing such a thing.
He collects clothes, sweets, jewellery, everything from the homes of the people and finds the needy and brings them in search and secretly.
Can we eradicate darkness in this festival with full awareness and determination
I will double your happiness on the commemorative festivals, your face will shine.
Your diameter will be more illuminated and your day will be more illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmiji comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Welcome to Laxmiji in a traditional way.
Can we keep programmes for the honour of daughters in our society, villages, cities
Can we have public programmes
There will be a lot of daughters who would have been nurturing the name of the family, the society, the country with their hard work and talent.
Can we programme the honour of Indias Laxmi on this day
There will be many daughters and daughters around us who would have been doing extraordinary work.
If someone is engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health then some doctor would be serving the society as an engineer.
Being a lawyer, you must have been trying to bring justice to someone.
Our society should recognize, respect such daughters and take pride in them.
His honour programmes will be organized across the country.
The promotion of Indias Laxmi means paving the way for the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the greatest benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I have the privilege of directly interacting with a large number of unknown people.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the results of my examination came, some people asked me whether they had read the book Exam Warriors.
I have not read this book.
But after returning, I read this book and read it twice or thrice.
My experience was very good about it.
I felt that if I had read this book before examination, I would have got a lot of benefits.
My little student friend, thank you for writing this letter first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You people have said that if I can take time for a new reproduction then I will definitely try to write something for my parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share your experiences with me about the aspects related to stressless examinations.
So I will wait for your thoughts.
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Ali tying from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister through newspapers and TV.
But you are aware that I too feel like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and hence the impact of things that happen in a normal life is also on my mind because I too have come from amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he was awarded the Grand Salem winner and the legendary of the tennis, Rafael Nadal.
The audience was warmly welcomed by the audience.
Even after defeating the difficult challenges, he praised his opponent Nadala and gave away the living image of Kheldili.
However, on the other hand, the winners also praised the Daniel Games.
The zeal and humility of the winners in the same match were both worth seeing.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev, I would especially tell you people to watch this video.
The thinking of our ancestors is really commendable.
We say in the scriptures there: i.e., when eligibility and humility are integrated in a person, then who cannot win
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, I am doing what I am going to do for your well-being.
There will be debates, parties will continue to run, but if some things are stopped even before it increases then it will be of great benefit.
It is very difficult to stop things that increase very much and expand very much.
But if we get awakened in the beginning and stop it then a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this feeling, I would like to talk especially to young friends today.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit the addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases very much to those who consume tobacco.
This is what everyone says.
The intoxication of tobacco is due to nicotine present in it.
Its consumption during adolescence also affects the development of brain .
But today I would like to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in India recently.
E-cigarettes are a variety of electronic devices different from common cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, nicotine consumption is done by heating nicotine rich liquid substances and making a chemical smoke.
We understand the dangers of ordinary cigarettes very well, but there is a misconception about e-cigarettes.
There is no danger from e-cigarettes.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, aromatic chemicals were obtained to prevent stink from spreading stink.
We have seen around us that even if father is a chain smoker in the house, he stops smoking the rest of the household and wants his children to not have cigarette-BD habits.
It is their endeavor that no member of the family should smoke or smoke.
They know that smoking, tobacco causes heavy losses to the body.
The Pinars also know and the Jonaro knows.
However, the issue of e-cigarettes is very different.
There is not so much awareness among people about e-cigarettes.
They are also totally unaware of its risks and sometimes e-cigarettes quietly enter the house and sometimes they are playing chess and they keep on showing each other.
Look, I am taking out my smoke from my mouth. Look, without fire, without burning fire, I will take out my smoke.
Once the youngsters and youngsters of the house get stuck in their slums then gradually they become addicted to this addiction and become victims of this evil.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are obtained in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You are aware that whenever someone smokes around us, we are aware of it.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in its pockets, it is known by smell.
However, there is no such thing with e-cigarette, so many youngsters and youngsters are very proud of knowing and sometimes very proud of their books, in their pockets, in their pockets, and sometimes they are roaming around in their hands and becoming victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that these new methods of intoxication do not ruin our young country.
Do not waste the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted.
Don't let this disease root out in the society.
I urge you all to leave the addiction of tobacco and do not keep any guarantee regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us together build a healthy India.
This is to be saved from all this for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a privilege for all of us that India has been the birthplace and workplace of exceptional people who have dedicated their lives not for themselves but for the betterment of others.
This is our Mother India, this is a multi-faceted country.
Many humans emerge from this earth.
India has been the land of birth and workplace of such exceptional people.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves but for others.
A similar distinguished person is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will proclaim a saint on October 13.
The work done by Sister Mary Thesis for the betterment of mankind in its short life span of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever Christianity did, it was done with devotion and dedication.
He is still moving ahead with his vision and mission.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today that when we are celebrating 150, 130 crore Indians have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
Today, the eyes of all the countries are enshrined in India in the direction of environmental conservation, the way India has led the entire world.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the drive to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
At the same time, people are contributing to this mission in their own way.
However, we have launched a very unique campaign for the youth of our country.
When I noticed his work, I tried to understand this new experiment by talking to him on phone.
It may be that other people of the country can also use these things.
Mr. Rupudan Belviji is making a good effort.
For the first time when I heard the word ploging, it was also a new one for me.
Perhaps that word has been used in a few words abroad.
However, in India, Repudiation Belvi ji has made a lot of publicity.
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run.
We have heard how this programme should be done and what is happening in the programme through the experience of Rupudanji.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then our India will move 130 crore steps in the direction of getting rid of single use plastic.
Once again, thank you very much.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into national interest.
One thing is a desire to be remembered early.
However, I would like to extend it in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, but today I have been asking for it so that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We are going to run for the unity of the country on that day in thousands of villages of India, children, elderly, all people, schools, colleges, thousands of people.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
Make a night or two-night stoppage programme if it can be at least 15 places.
You see, understand and experience India.
We have so many diversities, and when these festivals are celebrated on the occasion of Deepawali, people are required and therefore I would again urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
And what are these reforms, where do I tell you
You will be happy to know that today we have 34 ranks and we had 65 ranks five years ago, so in a way we have killed a lot of monkeys.
If we strive hard, by the 5 years of our independence, we will make our place in the world's leading tourism.
Yes, it is also necessary to see that there will be no loss of fire anywhere due to cracks etc. on the day of Diwali.
You must take all the precautions that should be taken for this.
There should be happiness, joy and enthusiasm. Our festivals also bring a fragrance of community and also bring a culture of collectivity.
Collective life gives a new strength, it is the threshold of a new strength.
Come together, let us celebrate the festivals with enthusiasm, new dreams and new resolves.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to have an indirect interaction with the child friends of Karnataka.
The victorious Karnataka newspaper of the Times Group called upon the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And then he published some of the selected letters.
I read those letters, I felt very good.
These little children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
These children have written on a number of topics, Kirti Hegde of North Kannada has suggested that we need to change our education system by addressing Digital India and Smart City schemes, he added that nowadays children are not ready to study in classrooms.
And if we acknowledge the nature of our children then perhaps we can work in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadafe has written from Lakshmeshwar that she is the daughter of an army soldier.
And he has said, I cannot spend time with my friends as school is far away, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
This was a great experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India today.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
This day is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whoever reads these discussions, we are proud of the idea of a life dedicated to the nation.
Can you imagine that how hard he would have worked to build the Constitution of our country with diversity
You must have seen the philosophy of wisdom and vision and that too at a time when the country was getting rid of the slaves.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India by keeping in mind the visions of the Constitution, of the great men.
Our constitution is very broad.
Perhaps there is no field of life, no subject of nature that it has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the fundamental rights of every citizen, the poor or the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the tribal and the women.
And keeps their interests safe.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in letter and spirit.
Be it citizens or administrators, let us move ahead in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
Several Committees were constituted on important topics in the Constituent Assembly.
It was one of the most important committees in the world and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, the Constitution of India that we feel proud of is an infinite stamp of Babasaheb Ambedkar's able leadership in its creation.
He ensured that every section of the society is well-being.
On 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana Diwas, we salute him by remembering him as Kayam.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
On the fifteenth of December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is revered.
Sardar Patel, who became the iron man of the country from the peasantry, did extraordinary work to build the country at one stretch.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day but nine years ago, on 26-11 the terrorists attacked Mumbai, how can the country forget that
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism today has become a terrible form of an incident that takes place every day in every part of the world.
We have been tolerating terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
There were several people in the world who were not prepared to take it seriously but today when terrorism is throwing its twelve points, then every government in the world is looking at terrorism as a major challenge that believes in humanism and trusts in democracy.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
It is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world together have to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, this is the composition of this earth that has given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and radicalization make a naked effort to disintegrate our social tensions.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to become more aware of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December, we will celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy rescues and safeguards our coastline.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all will be aware that our civilization is beside the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu or Ganga or Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important for both economic and strategic purposes.
This is our gateway to the ancient world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
And when we look at history, at the time of Chaul Vanshi, eight hundred and ninety years ago, the Chaulanvi-Chaulnauka Dal was considered to be one of the most powerful naval forces.
In the expansion of the Chaul Empire, his navy had a very big role in making it the economic super power of that time.
The zeal and search tours of Chaul Navi are still found in Sangam literature today.
Very few people would be aware that most of the naval forces in the world had got permission from women on very long battleships.
But in the Fourteenth and eight hundred and ninety years ago, women played a very important role in the fight.
Chaul rulers had a very rich knowledge of building ships and building ships.
When we talk about the Navy, who can forget the capabilities of Chattarpati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy
The shores of Konkan, where the shrine is very important, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. either had come near the sea or were surrounded by the sea.
The Maratha Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
Maratha Navy had a combination of large ships and small boats.
Their navy personnel were very skilled in attacking and escaping any enemy.
And when we deliberate on the Marine Arms, how can it be possible that Kanoji does not remember Angeles
He took the Maratha Navy to a new height, and set the base of Maratha Navy personnel at many places.
After independence, our Indian Navy had also shown its valour at different times.
Whether it is Goa's Liberation War or the 11th India-Pakistan War.
In May-June this year, when there was a terrible flood situation in Sri Lanka, three ships of our navy immediately reached there and helped its government and its people.
Our ship INS Guide also provided humanitarian assistance in Rohingya in the month of September in Bangladesh.
In June last year, when the Pappua-Nugi government sent us a tactical message and requested us to save the fishermen of their fishing boats, our navy supported us.
On the 21st of December, our naval ship, INS Trikand, had also arrived in the West Area to assist in evacuating a merchant ship from anchors.
Our navy has always been proud to provide healthcare services to the FIGI Islands, to provide immediate relief and to provide sustainable humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country.
We Indians, we always respect and respect our defence forces, be it the land, the navy or the air force, every countryman salutes the courage, bravery, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
Therefore, the youngsters sacrifice their lives for the country.
Every year we celebrate 7th December as the Armed Forces Flag Day.
It is the day to take pride and respect for the armed forces of this country.
I am happy that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December, to reach out to the citizens of the country and to warn the people about the Armed Forces and make them aware.
The whole week small and big all put this flag on the chest .
A movement of respect for the army starts in the country.
We can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces on this occasion.
You can post their courageous steps to the experiences of the Armed Forces in your surroundings with video and photos related to them along with armedforcesflagday.
You can get information about the army from schools, colleges, armed forces and from them.
Our new generation can become a good opportunity to recognise the army.
This celebration also provides an opportunity to raise funds for the welfare of all our armed forces.
The funds are spent on the rehabilitation of the families of the soldiers who were martyred in the war, for the welfare of the injured soldiers by the Army Welfare Board.
Let us also do something that will enhance the morale of our armed forces.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the fifth of December is the World Soil Day.
I would also like to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
Whatever we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire grain is connected to the soil.
Even after thinking, we feel afraid that if there is no land or plant, then what would human life have been possible
It is because of the importance of our land that we have been awake since ancient times.
In our culture, on one hand, there is a simple effort towards farming, towards soil, devotion and respect among the people, on the other hand, scientific methods that are being nurtured in this land have been a part of our lives.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, both things have a significance, in which devotion to their land and in addition to scientific conservation of land has been maintained.
I had heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Earlier the farmers used chemical fertilizers and fertilizers and due to this the health of their land was ruined.
The yield was declining and consequently the income was declining and the productivity of the land was also slowly decreasing.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of the situation and after that they had examined their land from time to time, as they were asked to use fertilizer, fertilizer, micro nutrients and livelihood fertilizers.
You will also be surprised to know that what was the result of the implementation of the guidance given to the farmers through land health
These farmers grew by three to four times the production of wheat in 2016-17.
Our farmers have built more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country so that they can understand their land better and can also make it unproductive.
We worship Mother Earth, however, how do we damage her health with chemical fertilizers like urea
All kinds of scientific experiments have proved that more than necessary urea is causing serious damage to mother Earth.
The need of the hour is to once again raise awareness about this mother-in-law relationship.
Can our farmers, our sons and sisters of the soil make a solemn pledge that the urea they use today will make half the use of it when it will be 5 years of independence in 2022
What kind of changes are being brought about in the lives of the farmers
We are beginning to experience global warming and climate change.
There was a time when cold had started before Diwali.
Today December is knocking twelve points and the winter is gradually rising.
However, as the cold begins, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the joy.
But even in such a weather, people who are constantly awake can bring beautiful results and this is an inspiration for all of us.
Tushar has done inspiring work in spreading the message of cleanliness.
It shows that there is no age for cleanliness or there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man or a woman, cleanliness is essential for everyone.
And there is also a need to equip everybody for cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have a solemn resolve.
In the afternoon, we get to learn something.
Today they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is a field of sports or competition or a social initiative, our Divyangjans are not behind anybody.
You all will remember that our Divyang players won four medals by performing beautifully at the Rio Olympics and also made champions at the Blind Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several types of competitions across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and showcased their skills.
He also won the Golden Jubilee in the 0th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was chosen by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralmix competition.
He is one of the 32 para-transferees who will be trained at the Central For Accession in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the passion of Bhai Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today, special attention is being paid to access and opportunity for Divyangjans.
It is our endeavor to empower every person of the country.
Building an inclusive society with equality and maternity increases harmony in the society and move forward together.
I extend my warm greetings to all my fellow citizens and hope that this festival of Id gives us a new inspiration to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Forget sadness and do not forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this thing.
We have tried to recall several interesting incidents of the past year in our broadcasting process.
Can you make your contribution in this 
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year 
Remember such inspiring occasions of others .
If I remember good things then the spirit of doing good will be awakened and the mood will be created.
Good things provide energy to do well.
And I will try to convey the details of your hashtag positive India to the countrymen in the coming Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will return to you for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You will get a chance to talk a lot.
2nd October, 2019 on All India Radio
Six days after Diwali, the Mahaparv, which is celebrated, is one of the most rules and relevant festivals in our country.
In which traditional rules are followed in everything ranging from food and beverages to costumes.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely linked with nature and the worship of nature .
While the sun and water are at the centre of the worship of Chhath, there are integral items related to the worship of bamboo and soil.
The message of worship of the rising sun and the setting sun is full of unparalleled culture.
The important expression of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Before Chhath, the entire house is cleaned, along with the river, the pond, the pond, the worship place i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, prevention and discipline.
Normally people understand the feeling of indifference in asking for something but in Chhath Puja there has been a special tradition of eating after asking for the prasad.
Behind this tradition of asking for prasad, it has also been demonstrated that it destroys arrogance.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be appreciated and criticised.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief becomes firm that Mann Ki Baat has been linked to a hundred per cent unprecedented relationship with the people of this country.
Take the example of Khadi and Handloom only.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been a lawyer for handloom, for Khadi and what is the result of that
You must have been pleased to hear that Khadi and Havanat have been selling so much at the same store.
During Diwali, Khadi Gift Cooperation has registered an increase of about 680.
Total sales of khadi and handicrafts have shown an increase of about 70 this year as compared to last year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of all age groups like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine that this will benefit many weavers families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, Handloom has become a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by transforming the lives of the poor.
This is playing a very big role for Gramoday.
Shri Rajan Bhatte writes on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my lifetime experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces believe in Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaekwade has also written on the Narendra Modi App, why can we have arrangements to bring sweets to our security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our household sweets should reach the soldiers of the country.
You all must have celebrated Diwali with great joy.
This day also brought a special experience for me.
Once again I got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our brave security forces deployed on the border.
This time, I was unmindful of celebrating Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect all the soldiers of our security forces on behalf of every countrymen for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice, which our security forces defend the country by facing the difficult and odd situations on the border.
Wherever we get the opportunity, when we get the opportunity, we should know the experience of our soldiers, we should listen to their glorious story.
Many of us may not be aware that the soldiers of our security forces are playing an important role in peace not only on our borders but all over the world.
By becoming the UN Peacekeeper, he is naming India in the world.
Recently, on 24th October, UN Day was celebrated worldwide, United Nations Day.
Everybody recalls the positive role of the UNs efforts to establish peace in the world.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means that the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the UN since its inception.
You will be aware that both the proposals of the Constitution of India and the proposals of the UN Charter begin with the words WE THE PEOPLE.
India has always emphasized on women's equality and UN DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS is a living standard.
The proposal that was made in its preliminary framework was 'All men are free and equal' which was changed by India's representatives with the efforts of Haza Maheta and later accepted 'All Human Beings are borne free and equal'.
Though it seems to be a very small change, a healthy thought can be seen in it.
Many of you would have been receiving this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served in the UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with PEACEKEPING INITIATIVES and are the third largest in the world.
Till August 2019, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 OPERATIONS out of 1 UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS worldwide.
These OPERATIONS are operating in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and other parts of the world.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at Indian Army Hospital in Kongo and South Sudan and innumerable people have been rescued.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by doing People Friendly Operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in the cause of peace.
Very few people would be aware that India was the first country to send the Female Police Unit to the UN Peace Mission in Liberia.
And look, this step of India has become a source of inspiration for nations all over the world.
And after that all the countries started sending their own Women Police Unit.
It will be a matter of pride to hear you that Indias role is not limited to only the Peacekeeping Operations but India also does the job of imparting training to the Peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to work in difficult areas.
People have to stay in different parts of the country.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to move in accordance with the local needs and environment there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who made a distinct identity in Cyprus.
In 1988, at the age of 2, he was made a Force Commander for Operation in Namibia and he provided his services to ensure the country's independence.
General Thimayya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid down its credentials for peace.
India has always been a peace ambassador to the world as a message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone will live in peace, harmony and move forward towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land has been deprived of such great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagwani's statement, was also one of those extraordinary people.
He was born in Ireland as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel but Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
And the meaning of statement is that which is completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself in accordance with his name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Speech.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy and prosperous life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was deeply saddened by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
The British not only made our country a slave but they also tried to make us mentally slaves.
This work continued to be done by lowering our culture and producing a sense of inferiority in us.
Bhagini Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
Awakening the national consciousness, he worked to unite the people.
He went to different countries of the world and raised his voice against the evil propaganda about Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati is famous for her revolutionary poem Pudumui Penna, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that it was inspired by Bhagini's statement.
Bhagini Niveditaji also supported the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped publish and propagate bus research through his writings and conferences.
It is a special beauty of India that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Bhagini's statement and scientific Jagadishchandra Basu are a strong example of this.
In 1988, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people died in the audit.
Bhagini Speech started the work of cleaning the roads without worrying about her health.
She was a woman who could lead a comfortable life but she was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifices, people looked after him in service.
He taught the people the importance of cleanliness and service through their work.
And on his samadhi - "Here Repose Sister Navedita who gave her all to India" - Bhagwani's statement is resting here, who dedicated her all to India.
He undoubtedly did the same.
Today, there can be no better tribute to him for this great personality than to see that every Indian takes inspiration from his life and strives to follow the path of service.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on Children's Day on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the most important heroes of New India.
Your anxiety is true that the diseases that had come in the old age, the last stages of life have been seen in the children today.
It is very surprising today when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases were possibly happening among the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for suffering from such a disease in our youth is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the change in our food habits.
The society and the family need to pay attention to this.
When they think about it, you see that there is no need to make any difference.
It is necessary that we keep doing small things properly and regularly and change our habits and make them a nature.
I would like to urge the family members to adopt the habit of going to the open ground.
If possible, the elders of our family should also play with these children in open.
Instead of coming up on the lift, make sure that the kids go down the bed.
After dinner the whole family moves a little after keeping the children together .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will especially help our young friends to maintain a healthy lifestyle and save them from lifestyle disorders.
Before going to school, see how much benefit is the 30-minute yoga.
You can do the same thing at home as well as the specialty of yoga is that it is easy, easy and accessible. And I can say that people of any age can do it easily.
Several studies are being conducted to know how Yoga is effective in controlling diabetes.
It is also being practiced in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very encouraging.
We need Ayurveda and Yoga not only as a medium of treatment but also as a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the field of sports in the past.
Our sportspersons have renamed our country in different sports.
In Hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey.
Our sportspersons performed excellently and by that India became Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, India became the Asia Cup champion in 2003 and 2003.
On behalf of me and my countrymen, I extend my best wishes to the entire team and helpful staff.
After Hockey, there have been good news for India in Badminton too.
Badmint Star Kidambi Srikanth has made a sense of pride in every Indian by winning the Denmark Open exhibiting excellent performance.
This is their third super-series premier title after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA U-1 World Cup was organized this month.
Worldwide teams came to India and everyone showed their welcome on football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
The sportspersons were all enthusiastic.
Such a great event of the world, the whole world is watching you.
I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm and zeal of all the young players.
The World Cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Although India could not win the title, Indias young sportspersons won everyones heart.
The entire world, including India, recognized the festival of sports and the entire competition was interesting and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright, its signs are visible.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, as many people write about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then I will have to organize a Mann Ki Baat programme everyday and I will have to dedicate to Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
If someone sends a photo of the efforts of mistakes then there is a case of collective efforts of the youth.
Somewhere there is talk of innovation regarding cleanliness or changes caused by the public opinion of an officer.
In the past, I have received a very detailed report about the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGs called the Ecological Protocol Organisation undertook the cleanliness drive of the Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me the pictures of the fort before cleanliness and after sanitation.
I was stunned to see the photographs and I would like to tell them that the youth of the ecological production organisation, their sweat, their excitement, their determination can be seen in the lively pictures.
On seeing this, your disappointment will be altered in confidence.
This concerted effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collectivity and consistency.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all our countrymen to keep the historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November, we will all celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire mankind, and said that all species are equal.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women's dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28,000 kilometers on foot and during his visit he gave a message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, and showed them the path of honesty, sacrifice and dedication.
He conveyed the message of equality in society and showed his message not only through words but also through his actions.
He ran anchor, which generated serving in the people.
The feeling of unity and equality among the people was enlightened by sitting on anchor.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of a meaningful life - remember the name of God, work hard, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji also created Gurbani for his words.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us strive to move forward on the path of their message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, after two days, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he had laid the foundation of a modern Integrated India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
The speciality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only used to think transformatively but he was also able to find a very complicated solution to the complicated problem.
He was a fool in realizing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took the pride of binding India in one minute.
He ensured that crores of Indians are brought under the umbrella of One Nation and One Constitution.
Their decision-making ability enabled them to overcome all obstacles.
Wherever there was a need for honour, they offered their respect, where there was a need for use of force.
He said that there cannot be any distinction between caste and creed, all are the daughters and daughters of India, we should all love our country and build our own policy on mutual love and goodwill.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for our vision of a New India.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution to transforming the country into an integral nation is immense.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity will be organized across the country on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, which will include children, youth, women, all age groups from all over the country.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new resolve, you all have once again joined your daily lives.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through the skyscrapers, today there are 36 mobile apps.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country reach me, perhaps I can say very little things to you but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
Many of them are for reforms in the government.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes attention is drawn towards the collective problem.
And I take half an hour for you once a month, but people talk about it on Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
And as a result, it is easy to understand the sensitivity of the government and the powers of the far-flung society.
And that is why this three year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity that I have got to know about the feelings of the common man of the country.
And I believe that this idea will also be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will get a new consciousness and a new energy.
Once I had told Mann Ki Baat that we should worry while having a meal that we should not waste it as much as we need.
But after that I saw all the letters from every corner of the country, several social organizations, many youngsters have already been doing this work.
Several people working on the food that is left out in the plateau gathered and utilised it have come to my notice so that I could feel very satisfied and very happy.
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw a selfie with daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I talked to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
In view of this, not only in India but also in the whole world, a big campaign of selfie with daughter has been launched.
This is not just a social media issue.
This is a new self-confidence and a new era of pride in every daughter.
Every parent felt that I too should take selfies with my daughter.
Every girl feels that I have some greatness, I have some importance.
In the past, I had a meeting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
When I asked the people going to Tour to visit wherever you go, send a photo of Incredible India.
Lakhs of sisters from every corner of India, in a way, have become very invaluable for those working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this thing in Mann Ki Baat that how big a movement of events starts from us.
Today I feel like saying all these things because when I was thinking that three years have passed then several incidents of the last three years have come to my mind.
The country is constantly moving in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the society, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country. I have learnt from my countrymen in my three year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
It is a huge capital for any country, it is a very powerful force.
I heartily bow down to the countrymen.
Whether it is bedroom or bedroom or bedroom or bedroom, the experience is that the attraction of Khadi has increased in the young generation.
The sale of Khadi has increased and this has added direct employment to the poor households.
Discount is given in Khadi since 2nd October and several discounts are given.
Once again I would like to urge you to carry forward the mission of Khadi.
Let us work with that spirit to illuminate the lamps of Diwali in the house of the poor by procuring Khadi.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And due to the increase in interest towards this deficit, the Government of India has also increased the enthusiasm to think in a new way among the people working in the field of Khadi.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase the productivity, how to bring solar-effectiveness
How can we revive the old heritage which had been closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several types of activities have been added.
Many people have been given new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore resumed its closed training centre in Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to offer in this regard.
Now due to the resumption of this Training Centre, the new generation will be able to provide a new help in the construction of modern dhabas, in the construction of new things.
People have also started giving Khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all experience how things move forward with a comfortable spirit.
My dear countrymen, we had made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we had decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti, we would celebrate the festival of cleanliness across the country.
I will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President ji started this work and the country got connected.
Whether it is children, old people, men or women, cities or villages, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
And when I say that Sankalp se Siddhi, how this cleanliness drive is moving towards a solemn pledge, we are seeing it before our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, supports it and contributes to it.
This time, one thing is that we should clean up somewhere, the other is that we should not filth by staying awake, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then a ideological movement is also necessary.
This time several competitions were organized with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the Swachhta essay competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness is concerned, I never forget to be grateful to the people of the media.
We can see how much our country's electronic media can serve the country's print media in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days back, someone paid attention to Srinagar's 18-year-old Youth Bill Dar.
And you will be glad to know that Srinagar Nagar Nigam has built its Brand Ambassador for cleanliness and when it comes to Brand Ambassador, you will feel that perhaps he will be a cinema artist, perhaps he will be a sportsperson of the world.
Bill Dar has been in Swachhta for the past 5-6 years since the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar where plastic, polyethane, used bottle and waste keep cleaning it.
Some of them are earning.
Because his father died due to cancer in a very young age, he added his life to cleanliness.
I would also like to convey my best wishes to Srinagar Municipal Corporation for their initiative towards cleanliness and their imagination towards Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India feels like going to Srinagar and it is a very big thing to get so much strength for cleanliness there.
And I am glad that they have not only built Brand Ambassador but the corporation has given a car to Billa on cleaning this time and it also teaches people about cleanliness in other areas, it inspires and falls behind till the results are brought out.
Bill Dar is young, but it is a cause of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month to remember many great men for us.
These dignitaries guided us for the 20th and 21st centuries, led us, guided us.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on October 11 and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji on September 25.
Nanaji and Deendayal ji are also years of this century.
And what was the central point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not just to preach, but to guide the people through its conduct in their lives.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji, Deendayal ji are all such great men who remained away from the barriers of power but lived with the lives of the people and kept doing something for the welfare of the people.
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and went to the village. And today, when we are celebrating his centenary year, it is very natural to have respect for his village work.
Former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalamji used to talk about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he spoke to the youth.
He himself went to the village to see Nanaji's work.
Remembering all these great men is not a privilege for them. We recall these great men so that we keep getting the path ahead.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the Run for Unity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme will be organized across the country.
In every city of the country, in every city, there should be massive Run for Unity programmes and this season is also such that it is enjoyable to run, it is also important to get iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also move ahead with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We naturally say unity in diversity, Indias specialty.
We take pride in diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to repeatedly tell my countrymen of India and especially to my young generation that we are in an awakening situation.
Let us experience the diversity of India, touch them, feel their fragrance.
You see, even for the development of your personality, these diversities of our country work as a great school.
There are vacations, days of Diwali, there is a feeling of going around in our country, people go as migrants and it is very natural.
But sometimes there is a concern that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, we do not understand it, but we have started selecting foreign tourism by coming under the influence of the earthquake.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any bonds, but sometimes look at your house too.
Whether the person of North India is not aware of what is in South India
Whether the person of West India is not aware of what is in Eastern India
Our country is full of diversity.
All these great men made a wide range of India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
We tried to live India within ourselves.
Can we try to make the different states of our country, different societies, groups, their customs, their dresses, their eating habits, their beliefs as a student
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we do not just visit but try to commemorate them as a student.
I have my own experience that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India.
More than 4,500 districts will be such that I would have got the opportunity to stay in the night. And today, when I am taking this responsibility in India, I get the experience of visiting this place very much.
It is very convenient to understand things.
I also urge you to feel the reservoir of the immense strength of our vast India, while addressing the slogan of unity in diversity.
This includes the dream of Ek Bharat-Bharat Bharat.
There are many varieties of food habits.
Even if the whole life is eating a different diet everyday then no food can be repeated .
This is a great strength of our tourism.
Self-reliance on the diversity of the people of Kotikoti.
This experience will enrich your lives.
The scope of your thinking will be enormous.
And who can be a big teacher with experience
Generally, the period from October to March is mostly of tourism.
People travel.
I am confident that if you go this time too, you will take this campaign forward.
Wherever you go, share your experience, share photos.
Definitely send your photo on Incredible India.
If you want to meet the people there, not only the buildings, but also the photographs.
Write not only about natural beauty but also about the lives of the people there.
Write good terms of your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about it
You see, if all the people of a state ask about it then I would say in the government that it should be fulfilled and prepare a publication on the seven universal things that have come about every state.
That is, in a way, my aim is to encourage tourist destinations from the perspective of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an incentive in increasing the tourism of the country using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch me too.
It motivates my heart.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
In fact, I am a person like you.
We have seen a unique example of women power and patriotism.
Can we imagine that in this young age when the world has descended then what would be their mental state 
For 11 months, he worked hard and trained and dedicated his life to fulfil his husbands dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband, Kesh Dubey, used to work as a hero in the army and he was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided to join the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to respect our mother power, our brave hearts.
I heartily congratulate these two sisters.
He has created a new inspiration, a new consciousness for the people of Koti.
Congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country in the midst of a Navratri festival and Diwali.
We are hosting the World Cup of FIFA Under-1.
I am confident that football will be shadowed all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
There should not be any school or college ground in India where our youth are not sporting.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the entire world is playing on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
There is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere is full of pure fragrance.
The atmosphere of spirituality, the atmosphere of festivals, the atmosphere of devotion all around and this festival is celebrated as a festival of energy.
It is known as Shardiya Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Maa Shakti that our country attains new heights to fulfil the aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the power to deal with every challenge.
When the country progresses at a rapid pace and completes 75 years of India's independence in 2022 then the effort to fulfil the dreams of those who struggled for freedom should be the resolve of crores of people.
My best wishes to all of you.
Festivals should also be celebrated and enthusiasm should also be encouraged.
Mann Ki Aug 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand when it comes to knowing about violence from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry about it.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel who gives full strength to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and equal respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it sincerely.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of trust, whether it is a communal belief, be it faith in political ideology, be it faith in a person or belief in a tradition.
In the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, every person has every kind of system to get justice.
I would like to assure the countrymen that this country will never tolerate or tolerate any of those who have taken the laws, those who have been serving Daman in the face of violence, whether they are a group or not.
Everyone will have to face the law, decide the responsibility of the law and punish the culprits.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old, we need cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions then perhaps a day can be saved from 365 days which is not associated with any festival there.
You must have noticed that every festival of ours runs in accordance with the philosophy of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature.
Our wealth festivals are directly linked to farmers and fishermen.
Today, I am talking about festivals, first of all I would like to call you a fondness.
In the Jain community yesterday, the festival of Samvatsari was celebrated.
In Jain society, the festival of festivals is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava.
The last day of the festival is a festival day.
This is a really wonderful tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way, it is also called Kshama-Vani festival and this day is a tradition of calling each other a sweet pomp.
In his drama The Merchant of Venice, he wrote: Mercy is Two Wice Blast, It Blessessetth him that gives and him that is, forgives and forgives, and those who get the wounded receive the blessings of God.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilke had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years ago he had become a symbol of freedom movement before independence.
And since independence, he became a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and compassion.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to all the countrymen.
Recently, the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colourful festivals of India is the festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam reflects the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival brings a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people along with giving a message of love and harmony to the society.
And now our festivals are also going to be a cause of tourism attraction.
And I would like to tell my countrymen that like the Navratri festival in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal in a way has become an attraction for tourism.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what we can do in this direction.
A few days later, the festival of Idul uha will also be celebrated across the country.
Id-ul-uha greetings to all my countrymen.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and belief for us but we also have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and hygiene are associated with family life.
Preparation of festivals is viable, clean and clean.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to become a social nature.
Public hygiene must become a part of our country, not only in our homes but in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country, with those festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernisation are changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, what kind of modernity your thought process is, a trick is also being used to know this thing.
If it is against it, it is considered bad in society today.
And as a result of that, today I see that even in the Ganesh Festival, eco-friendly artefacts have been organised.
If you go out on YouTube, children are making Ganesh ji in every household, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
In a way, such an extensive training of environment consciousness has been seen in this Ganesh festival which has been observed earlier.
Media House is also training, inspiring and guiding a large number of eco-friendly Ganesh statues.
And as I said, our country is full of crores and crores of vibrant minds.
And it feels very good when some new innovations are known.
Someone told me that there is a gentleman who himself is engineer, who collects soil in a specific way, who combines it and trains people to make Ganeshji.
And if gene is immersed in water then it takes only one dollar of water so that it gets mixed in water immediately.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are getting visible.
The coverage of toilets has reached about 6 from 3.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when water was reduced after floods, so much dirt had spread everywhere.
In such a scenario, the workers of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat have completed 22 affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Everyone who had sweat came out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness was given by every worker of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind who inspired everyone.
The dedication to cleanliness, if it becomes our sustainable nature, then where can our country reach
Let us look for opportunities wherever we get the opportunity.
But let us all join.
Work together on the day of the sermon or on Sunday.
Go to the neighbourhood population, go to the nearby villages, but do it as a movement.
In this section, a section has been created where after the construction of toilets you can name yourself and name the family which you have helped to provide.
Friends of my social media can run a constructive campaign and the work done in the virtual world can be a revered inspiration at the grassroots.
The Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi Competition of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is a unique competition for you, a short film making competition, a painting competition is being organized.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no limit to age, no age-limit.
You can make a short film with your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language and it can also be silent.
Those who participate in this competition and the best three will be selected, three will be on the district level and three on the state level will be awarded.
So I invite everyone to come and join you in this campaign of cleanliness.
Once again I would like to reiterate that this year, on 2nd October, we should take a pledge to observe Gandhi Jayanti as a Clean 2nd October and for this, from 15th September, we should take the mantra of Swachhta to every household.
Definitely take any steps for cleanliness.
Strive yourself and participate in it.
See how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine.
You can imagine that after this 15-day cleanliness drive, after the same service, on 2nd October, when we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, we will have a sacred joy in paying homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I specially want to accept the loan of all of you.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart that is why you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I would like to express my gratitude because this programme of Mann Ki Baat connects lakhs of people from every corner of the country.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people sometimes write letters to me, sometimes messages are sent to me, sometimes a message is delivered on the phone, which is a big treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your messages more than you look forward to listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Arparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about one of my wives.
They always try to help the people, but I am distressed about a habit of it.
Once I went to Mall to shop with it.
He spent 200 rupees comfortably for a sari and the autorickshaw that he had taken to Mall for Pitza was levied for a long time with the rickshaw driver for a long time.
Buy vegetables on the way while returning and save four-five rupees after refunding on every vegetable.
I felt very bad.
We have to pay a big bill without asking the big ones and we have to fight for a few rupees with our labouring brothers and sisters.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell something around our house, some ferry is used, some small shopkeeper or vegetable seller or some autorickshaw driver, whenever we come in contact with the people who live their lives with hard work, we start cheating with them.
And whenever we go to a big restaurant to eat, we don't even see what we have written in the bill and we immediately withdraw money.
Not only this, even if we go to buy saris in the shop room, there is no emotion but we cannot live without emotions with the poor.
Have we ever thought of what will happen in the minds of the poor
The question for this is not about two-five rupees, it hurts his heart that you are poor and therefore you doubt its honesty.
You don't have any difference in your life for two or five rupees, but have you ever thought that your little habit might have caused a deep impact on your mind
Madam, I am grateful to you, you have given me a message by calling me a phone call.
I am confident that even my countrymen will leave behind if they have a habit of dealing with the poor.
My dear young friends, on 2nd August, the entire nation celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day marks the birth anniversary of great Hockey Player and Hockey's artisan Major Dhyan Chand.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this because I want the new generation of our country to join sports.
Sports is a part of our lives.
If we are counted among the young countries of the world then we should also look at the fields of sports during our youth.
Sports i . . physical fitness , mental alertness , personality enhancing , I understand what should be more than this .
Sports is in a way a very big mess of heart fair.
Today, in the computer era, I would like to warn that the playing field is even more important than that of a plant.
FIFA RAMO PARMO PENTURE OF THE COMPUTER, THE FOULBOLD RAMO PARANTU OF THE FOOLBOLL.
Crickets will be played on the computer but the pleasure of playing crickets below the sky in the open field is somewhat special.
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and all of us used to ask: When will you come back
Today, the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, they start watching cartoons in one corner or get stuck on the mobile game.
There was a time when mother used to tell the child that when you will come and today there is a situation that mother has to say - Betta, when will you go out
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent surge portal to explore and nurture sports talents where any child who has achieved some achievements in the sports sector across the country can upload his biodetta or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected sportspersons.
Let us welcome our youngsters from all over the world with this festival of sports, let us celebrate sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I would like to share my thoughts with the countrymen by becoming a touching incident last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the Himalayas.
The courage and courage of six daughters of our country who work in the navy, who have never had anything to do with the sea, inspire us all.
These six daughters will have to cross the sea by taking a small boat INS Tarini.
It has been named after this mission - Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will travel across the globe after months and months.
Sometimes it will spend 40-40 days simultaneously in water and sometimes it will pour 30-30 days in water.
Our six daughters, and this is going to be the first event in the world with courage in the waves of the sea.
Who would be an Indian who would not be proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire nation.
I will also make a separate arrangement on the Narendra Modi App for their experiences so that you can read from each other because this is a story of courage, a story of self-confidence and I will be glad to convey the thoughts of these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating the Teachers Day on 5th September.
Former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birth anniversary.
He was the President but lived as a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was devoted to teaching.
The great scientific Albert Einstein had said - It is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to Hawaken joy in creative experimentation and knowledge.
That is, awareness of creative emotions and knowledge among our students is the most important qualities of a teacher.
This time, when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all make a solemn pledge together
And when we talk about change in our country, we remember the teaching in our society just as we remember the mother in our family.
Teachers have a very big role in transformation.
Sometimes there have been incidents in the lives of every teacher that their sympathetic efforts would have been successful in transforming someones lives.
If we make collective efforts, we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come, let's take this mantra to the Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
From Ananya Awas.
I live in Mumbai and work for India Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been a subject of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world about the pundits of the economic world.
On 28th August, 2014, he launched the drive with a dream in mind.
Yesterday, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is taking three years.
30 crore new families have been linked to it and bank accounts have been opened.
This figure is even more than the humidity of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that within three years my poor brothers and sisters sitting on the last corner of the society have become a part of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started moving in the bank, they have started saving money, they have started saving money, they have been feeling the security of money.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor, this saving is their strength in the coming days.
And those whose accounts have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefited from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - Rs.
In many families, because of the insurance of one rupee, when the poor was hit, the lives of the mother-in-law of the family ended and within a few days they got two lakh rupees.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana - be it Dalits, tribals, women, ethnic youth or youth who intend to do something on their own.
Not only this, everyone has also made a successful effort to provide employment to Ekta-Be.
A few days ago, the people of the bank had met me because of the Jan Dhan Yojana, because of the insurance, due to the Rupay card, the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana have been given to the common people and many inspiring issues have emerged.
Today is not that much time but I would definitely tell the people of the bank that MyGov has brought about such issues.
They can also inspire a new generation by interviewing such people.
The changes that are taking place in the changing cycle and environment have a very negative effect.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, Istan Bharat, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural disasters due to extreme weather conditions.
Areas affected by such floods are being thoroughly monitored.
Relief work is being done at a large scale.
My cabinet colleagues are also reaching Ruburu.
The State Governments are also making immense efforts to help the suppliers in their respective ways.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also making every effort to help people in such situations.
Whether it is the Indian Army, the Air Force, the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF), the paramilitary forces, all of them join hands in serving the injured.
Due to floods, life becomes very disoriented.
NDRF teams were executed.
They were made friends of disaster and trained what to do and what not to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and we should learn to work in a difficult situation by creating a public organisation.
Gradually, we should also create a feeling that we should consolidate our activities according to the weather conditions so that we can avoid harm.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that citizens of the country are more prepared than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have been received so many phone calls have been received.
And people are still expressing happiness about GST and also expressing curiosity.
And I would like to tell you a phone call, Namaskar Prime Minister, I would like to say Nitu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day address, and was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax-GST was launched in our country last month on the same day.
Can you say that the results that the government had expected are being received after a month or not
I would like to know your thoughts about this.
And when a poor person writes a letter to me and tells me that GST has reduced the emotions of the needy goods of the poor, things have become cheaper then I feel very satisfied and happy.
Recently, I was looking at the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of trucks has increased.
How is it taking less time to cut the distance
Highways are free from traffic congestion.
Earlier, being a separate taxpayer, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector were used to maintain paper and they had to make their own new godowns in every state.
However, GST is what I call Good and Simple Tax.
It has indeed made a very positive impact on our economy and in a short span of time.
The rapid transformation that has resulted in a smooth transformation that has resulted in a rapid transformation and a new registration has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, economists, management experts, technicians, Indian GST experiments in the form of models will be presented to the world.
It will become a case study for many universities of the world.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the States and the Centre.
And this is the result that every government has the same priority that there is no scope for a poor pool due to GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries involved in this work, to all the departments, to the Central and State Government employees.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, but a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I convey my best wishes to crores of countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Together, since childhood, we have been listening to this thing and because of this, the Non-Cooperation Movement started on 1st August, 120th August.
August, 1942, the uit India Movement, which is known as the Awakening Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th August, the country was freed.
In a way, several incidents of independence in the month of August are specially linked.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people know that the slogan of uit India was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
From 1985 to 1942, the way the countrymen continued to fight and tolerate the freedom struggle, this is our inspiration to build India the backbone of history.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom movement.
The movement was pledged to liberate the entire nation from British rule.
This was the time when the people of India had become a part of the uit India Movement, be it in the country, be it in the corner of the country, be it cities, be it educated or poor, be it poor or poor or every section of the society, against the British rule.
Jan Akrosh was at its peak.
On the throne of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were jumping their lives into a struggle with the mantra of 'Death to Die'.
Millions of youth of the country had left their education and had sacrificed their books.
They had come out after listening to the bugle of freedom.
Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement in August, but all the big leaders were incarcerated in the jail by the British.
And it was during that period that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan played a leading role in the country as the leader of the second generation.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement and uit India Movement, there are two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 120 and 1942.
The format of the Non-Cooperation Movement was different and the situation of 42 was different, the intensity grew so high that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi had given a mantra of death.
There was public support, peoples power behind all these successes.
It was a peoples resolve, a peoples struggle, the entire country was fighting together.
Sometimes I think that if we want to add a little to the leaves of history then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1985.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, continued till 1942, in some corner of the country.
During this long period, the people of our country had put a stir of freedom in their hearts.
Everyone is committed to something.
Generations have changed but there is no dearth of resolve.
People used to come together, they went away, new ones came, new ones got together and the country was trying hard to break the British Sultanate.
This effort from 1985 to 1942 created this movement in such a situation that it reached the peak in 1942 and the descent of uit India was such that within five years the British had to go to 14th century.
From 1985 to 1942, the five years of 1942 to 1944, when it reached the people of that period of independence, it became such a people, it became a people with solemn pledge that with the success of five decisive years of attainment, it became a cause of freedom for the country.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this destination.
In 1947, we became independent today.
It has been nearly 70 years since the governments came, arrangements were made, changed, developed, and everybody made their own efforts to get rid of the problems of the country.
Similarly, there was a decisive five years of achievement from 142 to 14 resolutions.
I see that from 2019 to 2022, a further five-year period from resolution to achievement has come before us.
We will celebrate the 15th August of 2019 as a solemn pledge, and when we mark 5 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform that pledge into a reality.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores and crores of resolves.
So, as the five years from 1942 to 1944 were decisive for the country's independence, these five years could be decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
Come, let us run a great campaign of accomplishment from August in the month of August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local bodies, schools, colleges, different organisations take some solemn pledges for every New India.
A solemn pledge that we will achieve in the next five years.
I am specially online today because we may be anywhere but we must be online.
I invite the online world and especially my young friends and my young friends to come forward in an innovative way to build a New India.
Using technology, use of videos, posts, blogs, articles, new ideas and ideas should come up with all these things.
Transform this spirit into a peoples movement.
The Narendra Modi App will also launch the uit India quiz for young friends.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must make a comprehensive propaganda and spread it.
There he does not say that the voice of 1. 25 billion Indians is echoing from the Red Fort.
This time also I invite you to send me your thoughts on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
I myself read it and I will try to illuminate whatever time I have on 15th August.
During the last three years, I had heard a complaint in my 15th August that my speech becomes a bit longer.
Whether success is achieved or not
My dear countrymen, I also want to say one thing.
There is a social economy in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just occasions of joy and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign of social reform.
But with that, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh festival after that, the fourth moon after that, Anant Chaudas, Durga Puja, one after the other, this is the right time when economic generation is available for the poor.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of families have started making hostages in small domestic industries.
Hundreds of crores of manufacturers, sheep sellers, sweets are connected to a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs on it only.
It is not just a festival, it is a festival, it is a decoration of a house.
It is directly related to the poor families who make small walls of soil.
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen it and sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware than me, they are more active.
For the last one month, the citizens have written letters to me constantly about the environment.
He has urged you to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh from Ganesh Chaturthi so that people can plan on the choice of soil genetics from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to speak on this subject before time.
This time public Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of the Ganesh festival.
Once again, let us recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak to the Ganesh Festival this year.
And again, how should we take the Ganesh Festival in the direction of Tilak ji's spirit, how should we strengthen that feeling and at the same time keep our resolve to protect the environment by eco-friendly Ganesh, soil-made Ganesh
And this time I have said very quickly
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefits will be that the poorest of our artisans, the poorest of the artists, those who make statues, those who will get employment, the poor will be filled up.
Let us join our festivals with the poor, the economy of the poor, let us all strive to enjoy our festivals as an economic festival for the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly looking at the names of our daughters in the field of education, in the economic sector, in the social sector, in sports and sports.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
In recent times, our daughters performed wonderfully at the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to him but I was feeling that he could not win the World Cup.
There was pressure and tension on his face too.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail to do so, the anger of the country falls on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something that causes a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters were not able to succeed in the world, 1. 25 billion Indians took the defeat and they did not fall on the daughters.
Moreover, these daughters glorified what they had done.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to illuminate the country.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to the young generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Revolution, once again I recall the 15th of August, 2022, the 5th anniversary of independence.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge and prepare a five-year roadmap to fulfil his resolve.
We all have to take that country to new heights, to bring it to new heights.
Let us walk together, let us do something.
The fortunes of the country will be better and they should move forward with confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
The weather has become pleasant due to rains in many parts of the country.
After the rains, cold winds are experiencing relief from the heat that has fallen in the past.
And we have seen that our mindset changes only when there is a lot of problems in life, how much stress, personal life, public life and the coming of rains.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now some parts of the world celebrate the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannathji.
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
The people who came to Dr.
You must have studied Babasaheb Ambedkar, he must have seen that he used to admire the temple and traditions of Lord Jagannath as it included social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannathji is the God of the poor.
And very few people would be aware that there is a word in English, juggernaut and that means a magnificent chariot that no one can stop.
And in the Dictionary of this Journal, it is also seen that this word has emerged with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has adopted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath ji's visit, I extend my greetings to all my fellow citizens and bow down to Lord Jagannath ji.
India's diversity is also its speciality, India's diversity, which is also India's strength.
The people of the holy month of Ramzan celebrated it with dignity.
Now is the festival of Eid.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to everyone on this occasion of Idul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of worship.
Happiness is the month of sharing and the happiness that we share increases.
Let us collectively take inspiration from these sacred festivals to share the treasures of happiness and move the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, an inspirational event of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor of Uttar Pradesh came to my fore.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in a small village. In a way, more than one crore people belong to our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to make toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, the government also provides assistance and about one lakh rupees have been given to them.
1 lakh will be spent on other facilities in the village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for changing this auspicious occasion of Ramzan to the good of the society.
Everything of them is very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that there are three regions in our country - Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala - which have already become Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, rule and people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We know very well that if we have to do something good in the life of a person, in the life of a society then we have to work hard.
If our letter is bad, if we want to improve it then we have to remain very conscious for a long time.
Then changes the habit of body and mind .
The topic of cleanliness is similar.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to constantly strive to get rid of it.
Everybody's attention must be attracted.
We have to remember good inspirational events.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, I came across a very good event that I would like to say to you.
The incident is from Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken up a big task with the participation of the people.
100 hour non-stop campaign.
What was the goal
10,000 household toilets in 1 gram panchayats in a hundred hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 Village ODF.
I congratulate the people, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district for reaching the culmination of their hard work and setting an inspiring example.
These days, in Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting a condolence from the people, Narendra Modi continues to visit the App, Mygov.
They keep on coming on the lines, they keep on coming from the letters and keep on coming to the sky.
Shri Prakash Tripathy recalled that he had presented the 25th of June as a dark age in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathis democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15, 25 June was a dark night that no democratic lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into a prison.
The opposition voice was suppressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Jayprakash Narayan were locked in jail.
The judicial system too could not escape the terrible form of crisis.
Newspapers were made completely useless.
Todays journalists, the students of the world, the people working in the democracy, have been constantly and constantly trying to raise awareness about the black ages and to raise awareness about democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
When Katkatti completed one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and described the state of mind in his poetry.
We have to strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today feels proud to raise his head in the world.
On 21st June, 2019, the entire world became Yoga-friendly.
From water to mountain people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practiced Yoga on The Great Wall of China in China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters above sea level at World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru.
In France, people performed Yoga in the field of Eiffel Tower.
More than 400 people performed mass yoga in UAE's Abu Dhabi.
In Afghanistan, in Hairat, India made a new wait for India's friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghanistan Frendship Dam- Salma Dam.
In small places like Singapore, programmes were held at 0 places and for weeks they started their campaign.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters were organized at UN Headquarters.
UN officials, including diplomats from all over the world...
This time once again Yoga has also worked as a World Record.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by practicing Yoga together in Ahmedabad.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the privilege of doing Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen where there is 20, 25, 40 degree Celsius.
Our Armed Forces, BSFs, ITBPs, CRPFs, CISF have made Yoga their part with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family should share the pictures of Yoga.
Some TV channels also carried this forward.
I got several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am speaking to Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that we have recently heard in your statement in Kerala that we should give good reading books as mementos instead of the gifts and flowers we offer at different places.
You have started this work during your tenure in Gujarat, but in a few days we have not been able to see this work.
So can we do this 
Beeker Foundation organises book reading habits among people, people are aware of book reading, reading day and reading month.
For this, I got the opportunity to go on the occasion of its launch.
And Khadi's handloom, which also encourages Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become that habit, but after coming here my habit was over.
But he went to Kerala and once again he remembered it.
And I have recently started giving the following suggestions in the government.
We can also gradually create a habit.
And the flower bouquet has very little life.
Once we took it in our hands and then we put it in our hands.
But if we give a book then it becomes a part of the household, it becomes a part of the family.
Welcome to Khadi by giving a befitting reply, so many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure also decreases and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am talking about this thing then what a historical value of such things is there.
When I had gone to UK last year, ueen Elizabeth of Britain invited me to dinner.
Even though many years have passed, ueen Elizabeth preserved the legends given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was seeing it, I was urging them to touch and see.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that habits do not change overnight and when we talk about it then we also have to become a victim of criticism.
However, there will be criticism, but if I keep talking then there will be a change.
My dear countrymen, being the Prime Minister, there are several types of work.
I have to stay in the files but I have a habit that I read a few letters from the letters I receive every day and that gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of letters come, different kinds of people write letters.
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I feel that I must tell you about it.
In a remote south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arulmoji Sarwan, he sent me a letter.
And in Chitti, he wrote that I thought of doing some economic activity along with paying attention to the study of children in my family, which would provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took money from the bank through the Mudra scheme and started a small task in the direction of sending some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has set up a system called Servant e-Marketplace.
So I found out about it and asked people about it.
Then I myself made a register in it.
I would like to tell my countrymen that if you also get the opportunity, you should also visit the e-GeM on the internet.
Those who want to send supply of goods to the government, want to send small items - they want to send electric bulbs, they want to send a dustbin, they want to send savouries, they want to send Khurshi, they want to send a ticket, they want to sell it, they can register their names in the site.
And the people of the departments of the government will have to visit that site on a compulsory basis, they will be able to keep it in writing about what quality they have, how much they will sell it and how much they will sell it.
And then we have to order them.
Every department of the government looks after those who register their names within the e-GeM.
Due to non-stop intermediaries, goods are available at affordable prices.
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has given the registrar of all the goods that could be given on this website of the government.
And it is a matter of joy that the letter he has written to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got money from Mudra, my business started, what I could do within e-GeM and what I would have asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office bought two thermos from me.
And I got my bill worth 1600 rupees.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace-GeM.
I would certainly like that those people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way that they can add more and more people to this site.
I believe that this is a wonderful example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance (Most Government Empowerment) and its goal is minimum price and even easier efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we are proud of our achievements in space sciences.
And this is the uniqueness of India that if our feet are on the ground related to Yoga, then our dreams are to overcome far and wide horizons.
A few days ago, India has made a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched a 30-nne satellite with a Cartoset-2 series satellite.
And in this satellite, besides India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
And this satellite mission of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the work of farmers, in times of natural calamity.
A few days ago, we must have remembered that ISRO had successfully launched GSAT-1.
And the satellite that India has launched so far is the most weighty satellite.
And if our country's newspapers compare it with the weight of its elephants then you can imagine how much our scientists have done in the field of space.
One thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 1st June.
However, I am glad that the efforts of our scientists have been successfully completed for six months and now even after a thousand days our Mangalyaan Mission is working.
Photos are being sent, information is being provided, santificial data is coming, they have been working more than their time.
Our scientific journey to complete one thousand days is an important step in our space journey.
We also see that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
It is now visible that our young generation is looking forward to sports as well as sports. And due to our hard work and hard work, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, India has enhanced the honour of the country by encouraging Badminton player Kidambi Srikanth on his victory in Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest greetings to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
Ushaji's Usha School of Athletics had the opportunity to attend the inaugural function of Synthetic Track.
Sports personality also plays a very important role in development.
The importance of sports in overall personality development is very big.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family is also interested in sports then they should be given the opportunity to play.
If they are capable of sports, if they are interested in sports, then schools, colleges, family and the surrounding people should encourage them.
Everyone should dream for the current Olympics.
Once again, my loved countrymen, the atmosphere of rains and festivals, in a way, the experience of this period is new.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
Rainfall is awaiting the sight.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and around the world, especially the Muslim community, on this auspicious month.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and donation are very important.
We Indians are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can take pride in the fact that we can take pride in the fact that all the communities of the world are present in India.
This is a country in which people who believe in God also live and those who deny God, those who worship the idol, and those who oppose the idol worship also live.
Every kind of thinking, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living in harmony. And, be it religion, culture, philosophy or be it tradition, it gives us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred month of Ramzan will surely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I had used a word and specially told the youngsters to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way that there can be some danger and difficulties can be invited.
I am happy that many people have given me an impetus.
Personally, everyone showed me the courage to speak for myself.
Some dramas learn, some people have written that we have started writing poems.
My reading habits were almost extinct.
Therefore, I decided to study in these holidays.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized that how much struggle had to be done to make India free, how much sacrifice had to be made, how many freedom fighters had spent years in jail.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh who did a lot in his young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to todays generation on this subject.
I am glad that the young generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men who spent their youth in prisons laughed and laughed at the hands of many young people.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
We must have seen that the great men who spent their time in the freedom movement did a great job of writing, studying and doing a great job.
Many years ago, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar.
The Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmath in jail.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were shut down in a small coat.
Imagine what kind of milestones those who have been deprived of freedom must have been there.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmath, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India that would not have spoken any language of India that would not have laid down its youth in the Cellular Jail in the Andaman jail for the sake of freedom, for the sake of black water.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I would certainly like to tell the youth of the country that what kind of evils people had to face for the freedom that we have got, if we want to go to Cellular Jail then we will know.
Whenever you get a chance, you must go there in a way that is the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
To connect with nature means to nurture a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, we should take care of the world that we do not want, our duty is to worry about it.
If you are tired and if you open the windows of the rooms, open the doors, breathe fresh air then there is a new consciousness.
When this body of the Panch Mahabharata is in contact with the Panch Mahabharata then a new consciousness emerges in our body.
We all have experienced this, but we don't notice it, we don't connect it in a single thread, in a single thread.
After that you must see that when you are in touch with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you. And that is why the global mission to connect with nature on 5th June should also be our mission.
And we are getting some benefit from our ancestors who have protected the environment.
If we protect, our future generations will benefit.
Earth and environment are considered the root of strength in Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is the biggest guideline of the environment in a way and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We say: Mother Earth: Son Aham Prithviya: The Vedas say that the purity that we have in us is due to our soil.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is obvious that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had fallen below three trees.
But we need to connect it with modern methods in modern words.
These days, I keep getting news from the states.
In almost every state, a big plantation drive is going on in the rainy season.
Millions of trees are being planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a known day for the 21st of June.
The whole world considers it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has spread to every corner, it is connecting people.
On the one hand, while many powers of division are showing their distorted faces in the world, at that time Yoga is a great gift of India to the world.
We have connected the world with Yoga.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to racing and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also happening in the younger generation.
Yoga has an important role to play in leading a stress-free life in a time when medicines are being consumed and passed.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga to experience the journey from one's body, mind, thought, conduct to healthy lifestyle.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all the leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga related competitions.
Gradually the work will progress in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga and you ask me to do Yoga this time on the third International Day of Yoga for three generations of one family.
Be it grandparents or grandparents or grandparents or daughters, all the three generations perform yoga together and upload their photographs.
Yoga will get a new dimension if it will be a good coincidence of tomorrow, today and tomorrow.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had launched the Selfie with Daughter campaign, we had a very interesting experience.
These three generations of Yoga will certainly play a pivotal role for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Today, the practice has started.
I will continue to post some or the other Yoga related post on Twitter from June 1st and will continue to post till June 21st.
I'll share with you.
You should also propagate the topic of Yoga for three weeks, spread it and connect the people.
In a way, it is a movement of a preventive healthcare.
I invite all of you to join it.
Because I received a very interesting phone call and I didn't even think about it like this.
But I am grateful to them for the way they have captured this thing.
You will also be taken care of by this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am Naina from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
The zeal that you had taken from Kashi's ghats for cleanliness has now taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
Your fact is that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but during these days there is also a festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days prior to my visit, seven days prior to my visit, ten days ago, a lot of sanitation programmes are being organized.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how much pleasure I might have been able to know that the country and the country are taking this thing in a beautiful manner.
During my journey, cleanliness is linked to the topic, what can be a matter of greater happiness for me
The other preparations to be made for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be Swachhta, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
This is also a source of joy and inspiration for any Swachhata lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have helped in the cause of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, it is like this that the suggestion will spread some romance.
I don't know if I can do that.
Modi ji, before visiting you, those who want to invite you, tell them, "Brother, if you want to invite me, what would be the level of cleanliness"
I thought it was very good, but I had to think.
However, it is true that we should start a movement that it would be better to provide other things in the form of gifts so that we can clean so many tons of waste and give it in the form of gifts.
How many people can we stop getting sick
What will be the big task of humanity
One thing I would like to say that we should not assume that the waste is waste, this is a health and a source.
Do not look at it just as a garbage.
The Government of India has decided to launch a major mission of waste management with the help of State Governments as well as citizens representatives of cities.
On 5th June, the World Environment Day, solid waste and liquid waste will be available in about 4,000 cities of the country.
Two types of garbage will be available, one of the green and the other of the blue color.
Two types of waste are disposed of - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we remain in discipline, in those four thousand cities where garbage is required, wet waste should be put in blue waste and wet waste waste material like waste waste waste material, vegetable thread, waste food, egg harvest, tree leaves etc.
This entire process can be used in the fields, the color of the fields is green and you will be reminded of what waste is being used in the green waste.
And the rest of the waste like waste papers, cardboards, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals, all these things are called dry wastes which have to be recycled in machines.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news that the Versova Bitch, which was considered dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean silver Versova Bitch.
The entire responsibility was taken over by the Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV).
I convey my best wishes to Shri Afroz Shah.
I convey my best wishes to this movement.
And the way they connected the people of the entire region and converted them into a peoples movement, this is indeed an inspirational example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for months, be it printing, TV or social media, the present government has been continuously working for three years.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Servant.
I see this process as a very positive sign. There have been limited surveys and restrictions on Opinion Paul.
The period of three years has been enumerated on each case.
Every section of the society has reviewed it.
This is a great process in democracy.
I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, peoples participation should be accountable for their work.
For an aware nation, a conscious nation, this movement is very essential.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of all things lies on me as it is on the minds of a common man.
Mann Ki Baat sees it as a part of a conversation, some people criticize it politically but after such a long experience, when I started Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even think that Mann Ki Baat would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I sit in the midst of my family and talk about home.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me by writing these things.
And as I said, as a common man, I have an impact on my mind.
Two days ago in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker, Honble Speaker, everyone launched an analytical book Mann Ki Baat, as an individual, as an ordinary citizen, this event is very enthusiastic for me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, whenever I meet you people, there must have been rains in every corner of the country, the weather has changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the start of education will be started from the new age.
Let us all move ahead with love and affection for nature in this environment.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Those who suggest that most of those who try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
And when it came to mind, I felt that this suggestion is not normal, it is out of the threshold of experience.
I had never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of the fact that some social organisations have been working for years, but the youth of my country have been involved in it.
How many have sent me leaves.
There are several places where roti banks run.
People deposit their money in this roti bank, collect vegetables, and those who need it, they also get it from there.
Those who give satisfaction too, those who take it will never have to look down.
This is an example of what kind of work is being done with the help of society.
Today is the last day of April.
The foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is the first day of May.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have made every effort to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to both these states.
There was a time when climate change was a subject of education, it was a subject of symposium, but today, in our daily lives, we also experience it and express it suddenly.
Nature has also changed all rules of sports.
The heat that falls in our country in May-June has come to experience this time in March-April and when I was getting peoples suggestions about Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions have been given by the people on what should be done during this summer.
Although the lice are popular, it is not new, but at that time its re-membrance is very useful.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.
S.
Several friends like Kartik have expressed concern for the birds.
These friends have said that water should be poured on the roof of the balcony and I have seen that small children of the family do this very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, then they go ten times a day to see if there is water in the utensils or not.
We are aware that this game is going on, but in reality it is a wonderful experience of spreading sensitivity in the mind of the child.
You too, sometimes, sometimes with animals and birds, this feeling gives you a new pleasure.
In our country, we are dyed in the colour of animals and birds, nature, but collectively, such efforts are required to be strengthened.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it used to take hundred years for the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
I got the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He distributed about 52,000 grams of grams to every nook and corner of the world.
It was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that we come to our courts with printers, with milk, with vegetables, with posters, but we forget that there are days of heat, before we ask them for water.
Young friends, I would like to do something with you.
Sometimes I am worried that our young generation is enjoying living in Ashho-Ram.
Parents also glorify them in a defensive situation.
I am confident that some friends will definitely try and tell me.
Would you use this time of vacation as per my instructions
Let us have a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
Whether you have seen or not, whether you have thought or not, but if you want to go there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in books or listening to the acquaintances and feeling the same thing automatically is a distinction between both.
I would like to urge you to try and experiment with your curiosity in this vacation.
Whether it is positive or out of comfort, do it.
We belong to a middle class, a happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again.
Whether it is the time of the evening, take your football or taking a volleyball or any means of sports to reach the poorest of the poor.
Play with those poor children yourself, you will be able to enjoy such a sport that you may have never met before.
And Im confident that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteers organisations continue to serve.
You are also associated with Google Guru, find out about it and join any such organization for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time, you might feel that if you have done such a summit camp, if you have studied the course of personality development then you should reach out to those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn those people without taking the money that you have learnt.
You can learn how to develop.
Every person has become more busy with technology.
Community is also a culture, collectivity is a power.
Today is the era of defeat.
Sometimes there is a fear that our young generation is not becoming a human-robot.
Efforts are being made to spend time with them, away from technology.
You are learning any musical composition, you are learning 5-50 words of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
There is a country full of diversity and if we look at it, someone can learn from around us.
You want to learn car driving, do you ever want to learn auto rickshaws
You have cycled but the three-wheeler cycle carrying people has ever tried to drive.
You will see that all these new experiments, these schemes are such that will give you pleasure and the life that has been tied up in a diamond will also bring you out.
Do something out of box, mate.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you would be wondering if all the examinations are completed, if you go to a new stage of career then it will not be an opportunity to learn.
Later, you will be thrown into other junctions and that is why I would like to tell you that if you have the hobby of learning sports then learn the leaflet.
Keep on showing your warmth.
I say from my experience that the world can learn and understand so much that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like it and it is also true that whenever you are going, share your pictures.
What's new
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using 'Hashtag Incredible India'.
Friends, this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
The Government of India has a scheme.
If you download the BHIM App, you will also be using it.
But refer it to others.
Connect someone else and if a new person does three transactions, if he does economic business thrice then you earn 10 rupees for doing this thing.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get it from 20 people in a day, you will earn 200 rupees by the evening.
Merchants can also earn money and students can earn money.
And the scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
You will become a spirit of New India.
So vacation and earnings of income.
In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience says that the red light used to be on the vehicle, it used to be on the vehicle, but it used to slip into the brain and psychologically VIP culture was home.
Now the red light has gone so that no one can claim that the red light that has swept in the brain must have come out.
I received a very interesting phone call.
Well, they have expressed their apprehensions in that phone call, but now it is estimated by the phone call that the common man does not like these things.
It feels like getting rid of it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shiva Chaube from Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the red beacon light ban of the government.
I read a line in Newspaper in which I was very proud to hear the everily India is a VIP on a road and I was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in traffic jams and I don't have to stop for anyone.
So I would like to thank you very much for this decision.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that has been launched, our country is not only cleaning it. If the claims of VIPs are being cleared on our ways then it is a part of a system that goes to the red light with the gratitude of the government.
But we have to take it out with our hearts.
If we all make concerted efforts, we will be able to come out.
Our concept in New India is that the importance of EPIs will increase in place of VIPs in the country.
And when I am saying EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear - Every Person is Important.
Every individual has a great importance, every individual has a great importance.
If we accept the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians, if we accept the greatness of 1. 25 billion Indians then how power will be gathered to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always been saying that we should keep reminding our history, our cultures, our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of 1. 25 billion countrymen Sant Ramanujacharya ji.
We have become so small because of some reason that we have been thinking for centuries.
For other countries of the world, centuries have a very big significance.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years old memories in its destiny.
What would have happened a thousand years ago
Very few people would be aware that Ramanujacharya had fought a very big fight against the evils in the society, the feeling of untouchability, the spirit of casteism.
Through his conduct, the society, which was considered untouchables, was swallowed up.
Thousands of years ago, he had a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that a great man is born out of our society to eliminate the evil of our society in every age.
When we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramnujacharya Ji, for social unity, there is strength in the organisation, let us draw inspiration from him to nurture that spirit.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on the day of May 1st.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Ramanujacharya and pay my homage to him.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 1st May has a different significance.
It is also considered as a day of labour in many parts of the world.
When Labourers are discussed then it is very natural for me to recall Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the kind of respect that the workers receive today.
Baba Sahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Saint Ramnujacharya Ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer Jagat Guru Basweshwar Ji of the 12th century Karnataka.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a seminar.
This was an opportunity to dedicate the collections of his promises.
In other words, hard work is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about labour, it is very natural to remember Dattapanth Thangdi Ji.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate the festival all over the world.
The problems that the world is facing today are violence, war, vandalism, arms competition...
Buddhas thoughts seem to be very relevant when this environment is required.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of the journey of Buddha from the war.
I am fortunate that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima, vesak day is celebrated by the United Nations.
This year it is going to be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to pay my homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
There will be an opportunity to refresh their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, all of you, my blessings, most of the families in the country will be busy in examining their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a slight light atmosphere and where the examination is going on, there will still be some concern among those families.
But at this time, I would like to say that the last time I used to talk to the students in Mann Ki Baat, listen to them again.
You will certainly be able to use that conversation during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of Bangladeshs Independence.
A historic battle against injustice is the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizen brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh move forward, develop and I assure the Bangladeshi people that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our shared heritage.
Bangladesh's national anthem is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in the year 1913 and the British gave him the Nighthood Prize.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British. And we all know the incident of 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were satisfied to serve Mother India - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of his life were remembered for his mother Bharati's freedom.
And these three heroes are still the inspiration of all of us.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three young men.
The prison was closed, the hanging was fixed, but the British were worried about how to move ahead with it.
And it was only then that we had to get stuck on 24th March, but on 23rd March we were released.
Phansi was slaughtered, which is not usually carried out.
And then the British quietly burnt their bodies in today's Punjab.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of fragrance on that land.
And I would certainly like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to go to Punjab, they must visit the place of the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, the mother of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the pace of freedom, its intensity, its spread was increasing.
On the one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired many youngsters for the armed revolution.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian thoughts were first seen in Champaran in Indias freedom movement.
This was a major turning point in the entire journey of freedom.
Especially in the context of the methods of conflict, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Satyagraha of Kheda, Millionaire in Ahmedabad, all of them witnessed the enormous impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and working style.
Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1919 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a person who returned to India in 1915, just two years of work.
Neither the country knew them nor was it their impact.
We can guess what kind of hard work they had to face at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour, along with Mahatma Gandhi, organising, inspiring and bringing the poorest and the most destitute in the British Sultanate to the ground for struggle.
And that is why we feel the bravery of Mahatma Gandhi in this form.
But if we think about Gandhiji a hundred years ago, it is a matter of great study for Champaran Satyagraha, for any person starting a public life.
We can learn from them how to start a public life, how to work ourselves and how Gandhi did it.
And this was the time when we heard the names of the big dignitaries who had sent them to the villages be it Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani ji.
We had to connect with the people and learn the way people were working with the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what is Gandhi's methodology and struggles are also going on and both are going on together.
Gandhi looked as if he had built one or two sides of a thread.
Conflicts on one side of the tunnel and on the other side.
On the one hand you will fill the jail and on the other hand you will find yourself in the creative work.
There was a wonderful balance in Gandhi's work style.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be the word of non-cooperation, what is the use of non-cooperation against such a great Sultan, Gandhi had established a complete new image not through words but through a successful experiment.
This is the desire of millions and millions of Indians for this transformation that will lay the foundation of New India and New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party electorate nor a project.
It is a feeling that 125 crore Indians together want to create a grand India.
125 crore Indians have a hope, a zeal, a resolve, a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our lives and try to understand what is happening in the society with an emotional vision, we will be surprised to know that the lakhs of people are selflessly looking at something for the society, for the exploited, the deprived, the deprived, the deprived, the deprived, the poor and the unhappy.
And, like a serving servant, he continues to do so.
Many people go to a regular hospital and help patients.
Many people who know that they immediately run for blood donation.
There are many people who worry about their food if they are hungry.
Our country is a multi-dimensional population.
This mantra is in our blood.
Once we want it in the form of collectivity, in an organized form, we will know how big it is.
Whenever it comes to New India, it is very natural to criticize, understand and look at it from a different perspective and it is welcome to democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge, decide a path to realise their solemn pledges then the dream of a New India - a New India can be realized in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all things should be done by budget, government projects or government funds.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full authenticity and honesty, if every citizen makes a solemn pledge that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diesel in my life then how big a change can be brought about.
It means that every citizen follows his own civil religion, follows his duty.
This can be a good beginning for a New India.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
In the last few days, this kind of atmosphere was created in our country, a large number of people became part of the Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
How the transactions can be done without cash, its curiosity has also increased.
The poorest of the poor are also trying to learn and gradually people are also moving towards how to do business without cash.
Digital payments have seen a substantial increase since demonetization and post-demonetization.
With the launch of BHIM App, it has been only 2-3 months but now about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption. Can 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge to work in a year
We have announced in the budget.
For 1. 25 billion Indians, if they want to do this thing then they dont have to wait for a year, they can do it in six months.
2500 crore digital transactions, if we have to pay the fees for the appointment then we will not pay the money in cash, we will have to travel in the railways, if we have to travel in the air, if we have to pay the digital payments, if we buy the medicines then we will pay the digital payments.
We can do this in everyday life.
You cannot imagine but you can serve the country very well and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes of Digidhan Mela have been organized for public education.
It is a pledge to organize 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have already been conducted.
It was also a prize scheme.
About 12. 5 lakh people have received this reward from the consumer.
0,000 people have received the prize for the traders.
And everybody has pledged to take this work forward.
And as decided several times earlier, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be the culmination of the Digidhan Mela.
After the completion of 100 days, a big event is going to take place.
A large number of draws have also been added to it.
I am confident that we should propagate the BHIM App in the time spent by Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary.
Let us contribute to the reduction in cash transactions, reduction in transactions with notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask people to make a suggestion for Mann Ki Baat, all kinds of suggestions come.
However, I have seen that everybody has been urging everyone to do something for cleanliness.
I would like to talk to you about my heart.
I would like to say that people will have to understand how important cleanliness is.
Every day I pass by a river in which people throw very much garbage and pollute the river.
That river comes to my house flowing near the Rispana bridge.
Several people have also spoken about it but it has not benefited from it.
And the good thing is that Gayatri himself is also provoking his anger, instructing me and at the same time he is also telling me that he has made several attempts but he has failed.
Awareness has emerged from the beginning of the Swachhata movement.
Every person has joined it positively.
It has also taken the form of a movement.
Hate towards dirt is also increasing.
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, all of them have their own importance.
But cleanliness is connected to the habits of movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits, this movement is a movement to create the habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be done collectively.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I am confident that this spirit has emerged in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth and this is a sign of good results.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell all those countrymen that this message of Gayatri should become a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat since the beginning, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one thing and most people have expressed concern about the waste of food.
We know that we take more food in the plate than necessary in the family and in the community food conventions.
Everything that we see is taken in the plate and it can not be eaten .
We cannot eat half of what we fill in the plate and we can move ahead by keeping it there.
You have imagined how much damage we have done to the food we give up.
Have we ever thought that if we do not waste food, we can fill the stomach of some poor people
Despite some efforts being made by somebody, sadness on this subject is a society.
Injustice is done to the poor.
I am not appealing much on this subject but I want to raise awareness.
His life inspires us not to waste food.
We should eat as much as we eat.
See, there are similar solutions for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep a little empty stomach, keep some plates empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally depressed.
The problem is that there are people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are constrained to speak openly on this subject.
Those who are suffering from depression themselves don't even speak because they themselves feel embarrassed about it.
I would like to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot be freed.
There is a need to create a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, there is a need for a transmission.
Talk openly with your friends, friends, parents, brothers and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes there is a feeling of solidarity and especially the students living in the hostels have a lot of trouble.
Families are large, they are mixed there due to which there is no possibility of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that sometimes you have seen that your daughter or any member of your family should sit with everyone and say that I will not go now, then you will not come back on the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to stay in a group and stays in a single corner then try to keep in mind that it should not happen.
This is the best solution.
And depression is the cause of mental and physical illness.
Just as diabetes is a host of all diseases, similarly depression also eliminates our capabilities of sustaining, fighting, courage and decision-making.
Friends, Your family, your campus and your atmosphere together can stop you from going to depression and if you have gone then you can quickly get out of it.
Help with your heart, share their happiness and grief, you will feel that your internal pain will be over.
If you try to understand their sorrows and do them with service, then a new self-confidence will emerge within you.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly, your heart will be lightened.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in getting rid of stress, getting rid of suppression and moving towards happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
All of you make preparations and celebrate Yoga Festival in a group of lakhs.
If you have any suggestions about the 3rd International Yoga Day, send me through mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetic creations can be prepared about Yoga should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But women have special responsibilities along with their work.
He also takes care of family responsibilities and collaborates in the economic responsibilities of the family, which sometimes leads to injustice to their newborn children.
At that time, the Government of India has taken a very important decision that the Maternity Leave, which was earlier 12 weeks old, has now been increased to 26 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then our children will grow up to become the invaluable price of the country.
It will also ensure health of mothers and it will be an important decision for this.
This will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the lives of all these great men inspire us, and fulfil the resolve of a New India.
After two days Chaitra Shukalpada, Year Talent, Nine Samvatsar, I extend my best wishes to all of you for this new year.
This is auspicious time for farmers to start harvesting after the spring season.
Nine years are celebrated in different forms in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only the flowers, the fruits on the branches of the trees are seen shining in the sun.
Fruits of summer season are also seen in monsoon season .
On the other hand, yellow mustard flowers in the field provide hope to the farmers.
The flower of saffron indicates the arrival of holi.
Amir Khusro has made a beautiful description of the moments of climate change.
Amir Khusro has written: When the flowering beauty of the flowering skull is full, Desu Phule, Koyal Bole, when the nature is pleasant and the weather is beautiful then the person also enjoys this season very much.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi festivals enhance the colours of happiness in the lives of human beings.
In an environment full of love, brothers and humanity, we have to leave for the last month and we are ready to welcome the New Month Chaitra.
It is a coincidence of just two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the lakhs of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I am ignoring the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there is a limited suggestion.
On the Narendra ModiApp, a lot of people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO. Therefore, he said, I have given some information about the launch of 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Thank you very much for your blessings on the occasion of India's pride.
Be it eradication of poverty, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, knowledge, intelligence, technology-science has established its place everywhere.
15th February, 2019 is a day of pride in Indias lives.
Our scientists have proudly elevated Indias glory to the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions over the years.
ISRO has created a world record in the field of space in the past few days after the successful launch of Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars.
And it is heartening to note that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but for the entire India.
This Coast Efficient Space Programme of ISRO has become a surprising thing for the entire world and I appreciate the success of Indian scientists by the world.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is very important.
Cartosat-2D is Indias satellite and through it, it will be of great help in the planning of the Urban Development Photographs, Resource Mapping, Infrastructure and Development.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, this new satellite catrosat 2D will be of great help to all the topics of how the water resources in the country can be used and what should be kept in mind.
Our satellite also sent a few pictures.
It has started its work.
It is also a matter of happiness for us that this entire campaign has been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a tremendous partnership between youth and women is a proud aspect of the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
Our scientists are as underprivileged as we have given their entire team.
Shravanji has asked another question and that is Indias security, India has achieved a great achievement in this regard.
There was not much talk about this but the focus of Prasanna ji has gone on this important issue.
India has also successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
The interception technologies missile has successfully destructed the enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground during its testing.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that even if India comes to an attack from a distance of 200 kilometres, it will destroy it in this missile space.
Whenever we want new technologies and new scientific achievements, we are happy.
And scientists have played a very big role in the development journey of human life.
And those who have a unique intellectual talent do not let the curiosity live in the form of a curiosity, they also raise questions within them, find new curiosities, create new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for new discovery.
Until they get the answer, let them sit on their feet.
And if we observe the journey of human life for thousands of years then we can say that this journey of development of human life is not complete.
Full break is impossible.
Efforts are being made to know the rules of the universe and the mind of the human being.
New science and new technologies emerge from it.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I often tell you about the fact that our youth should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific era becomes a reason for a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Invitation was given for Social Utility Innovation.
How to identify, demonstrate such discoveries, give information to the people and how to use such discoveries for the common people, how to use them for the commercial use of waste products.
Many times the problem also shows the importance of science in solving solutions.
In Mumbai, in 2005, there was rains, floods, seas, and there was a lot of trouble and crisis. And whenever there was a natural crisis, the first crisis came to the poor.
Brothers and sisters worked very hard for this thing and they developed a house that protects the people from such an embarrassment and saves them from water logging and preventing water-logging diseases.
And our society also becomes technology-driven.
Mechanisms are also made technology-based.
In a way, technology is becoming a part of our lives.
In the past, there has been a lot of importance on digital payments.
Gradually people are coming out of the cash and are moving towards the Digital movement.
Digital payments in India too are growing at a rapid pace.
Especially the youngsters have started having the habit of digital payments with their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to them.
In our country, the Lucky Grahak Yojana has received huge support from the Digidhan Business Yojana in the past.
It has been almost two months and 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of happiness that under the DGDAN scheme so far, ten lakh people have been rewarded, more than fifty thousand traders have been rewarded and more than one and a half crore rupees have been received in this prize.
Under this scheme, most of the consumers are those who have received a prize of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of fifty thousand rupees.
Whether it is a farmer, a trader, a small entrepreneur, a businessman, a housewife, a student, everyone is enthusiastic about this scheme.
From Mysore, Shriman Satish ji happily wrote on Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
But I should tell you that they have written the biggest thing.
He said that I got a reward of one thousand rupees and at that time I came to know that a poor elderly woman had a fire in her house.
When the goods were burnt, I felt that the prize I have received is perhaps the right of this poor elderly mother, so I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very inspiring job.
It keeps on giving information about this digital instance for a long time.
So enthusiasticly speaks and encourages others.
I would like to appeal to the countrymen, especially to the youth of the country, to the Lucky Grahak Yojana or to the rewards they have received from the Digidhan Business Yojana.
You should take it forward and it is an anti-corruption activity in a way.
In a way you are a soldier of ethics.
You are aware that on 14th April, when the Lucky Consumer Scheme is completed, Dr.
It's a memorable day.
On 14th April, a pipeline of Rs.
There are still about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing after remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Recently, the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar has been celebrated.
You must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App while remembering them.
Learn how the transaction takes place and especially the small traders around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and Bhima App, I would like to say that Dr.
For the last two-three months, this movement has been successful in several townships, several villages and several cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
Today, I would like to say a lot of happiness to you people.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have stored food storage by working hard.
With the hard work of the farmers in our country, record food has been produced this year.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all old records.
This time there was such a crop in the fields that it seemed as if Pongal and Baisakhi were valid today.
More than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced this year.
It is also 8 higher than the last record in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I also want to thank the farmers for cultivating different pulses keeping in mind the traditional crops and the poor of the country because pulses alone provide the highest protein to the poor.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and cultivated several pulses on nearly 9 lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service for the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters of my country deserve special thanks for the way the farmers of my country have made records by working hard for their crops.
My countrymen, this is something going on in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations.
In a way everyone is being seen doing awareness about cleanliness in some way.
And in the state of Telangana, there was not only a seminar in the closed rooms in Warangal but also an experiment on the importance of direct cleanliness.
On 1-18 February, a toilet pixel exercise was organized in Hyderabad.
The toilet pits of six houses were cleaned and the officials automatically showed that the empty pit toilets could be re-experimented by evacuating them.
He also demonstrated how convenient the toilets of new technology are and there is no inconvenience in sanitation, there is no constraint, there is no psychological barrier.
And we can clean a toilet in a similar way that we can clean it.
And the result of this effort was that the media of the country gave a lot of importance to it and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet then it is natural for the country to pay attention to it.
And one of the toilet pits that we consider waste but from the point of view of sure it is equivalent to a black gold.
We can see what happens from waste to wealth.
And this has been proved.
For the family of six members, a standard Twin Pit Toilet model is filled in about five years.
Thereafter, we can easily remove waste and redirect it to another pit.
In the six to twelve months, the waste collected in the pit is completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handle and are very important in terms of fertilizer NPK.
Farmers are well aware of the NPK.
And now a special programme is being organized in Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as possible.
Different departments also consider Swachhta Pakhwada in the government.
In the first fortnight of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Tribal Affairs Ministry will give a boost to this cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also take forward the campaign for the last two weeks in March.
We know that whenever a poor citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy, it increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the exhibition performed by our Divyang sportspersons at the Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held in the same month, India has made the country proud by defeating Pakistan for the second time as a world champion.
Our Divyang friends of the country are proud of their achievements.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every time we learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
He is moving ahead with a lot of hard work and illuminating the country with his achievements.
In the last few days, our women sportspersons won a Silver Medal in the Asian Rubby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March marks the World Womens Day.
To give importance to the girls in India as well as to increase their awareness and sensitivity in the family and society.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, it is not just a government programme, it has become a campaign of social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common man.
These vivid issues in every corner of the country have forced people to think and have brought about changes in the thinking of the people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a child, it gives a lot of pleasure.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that children have been banned under a special campaign in the Cuddalore district of the state of Tamil Nadu.
More than 15 childbirths have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand girls under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme and in addition to organizing Gram Sabhas, efforts are being made to ensure that the orphan girls are taken by the district administration.
Under the Har Ghar Dastak programme in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the education of girls from every village to every household.
Rajasthan has started a campaign to inspire the girls who had been drop-out by running the 'Upna Bacha Upna Vidyalaya' campaign to re-school and re-read.
It means that the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao movement has taken a number of forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New ideas are connected with it.
It has been cast as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign when we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
My dear countrymen, you have the opportunity to have a few conversations at various times in Mann Ki Baat. Women is that power, empowerment, it is the woman of India.
I get a lot of information from you.
What is going on on on earth, what is going on in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the past, we have celebrated many festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Sri Krishna was celebrated in entire India.
And every person can find solutions to the present problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes it is an innovation to pick up the threads.
And that is why today when I talk to you, I look forward to two Mohans.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had utilised his intelligence, his duties, his powers and his thoughts to fight the war.
And even Charkhadhari Mohan had chosen such a path that for the freedom of mankind, for the people of human values, for strengthening the essence of individuality, he gave such a glimpse to the people of freedom which is surprising for the entire world.
Be it the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or be it the importance of laughing in the midst of every destruction in life, we can learn all this from the message of Lord Sri Krishna.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing a bigger festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new dimension to human history, set a new dimension.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Anyone, whenever needed, was always present for Mahatma Gandhi's service.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized on the spirituality associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, society, humanity and humanity were the same.
Be it Phoenix Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm in Africa or Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha Ashram, he in a unique way emphasized on social upliftment and community mobility.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi Seva Bhav had also emphasized on organizationalism.
Social service and social reform, community service and community mobilisation are the emotions that we can bring to our lives.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No, my countrymen.
And collectivity has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi Symposium have collectivity and service.
Why shouldn't we get out of the entire atmosphere together
If we have a football team, I will not only play a football team, but will also work in line with Gandhian ideals.
We can do a lot, we can collect old books and share them among the poor and spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore imaginations, 130 crore can become entrepreneurs.
Whether it is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Vishwas or Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Vikas or Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Vikas or Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Vikas or Sabka Sabka Sabka Vikas or Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Vikas
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom struggle.
I inaugurated a very modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi of Dandi.
I urge you to visit one of the places related to Mahatma Gandhi in the near future.
It can be any place.
Whether it is Porbandar or Sabarmati Ashram or the ashram of Wardha or be it associated with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two or four words expressing your feelings.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But one thing is very interesting in this regard, which I would like to share with you.
Venice Biennel is a well-known art programme where artworks from all over the world gather.
This time, a very interesting exhibition related to the memories of Gandhiji has been held in the India Pavilion of Venice Biennial.
The pictures of Haripura were specially interesting in it.
You might remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected the Chairperson was also included in the history of the event.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and conduct an exhibition session of his art work.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artworks enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his art instruments have made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages around Haripura and then produced some artworks showcasing the lives of rural India.
Venice of precious artefacts was highly discussed.
Once again, with my best wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to making any solemn pledge from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for the betterment of the country.
You must be reminded that in the last few years, we have been running the same service campaign for nearly two weeks before the second October.
This time the campaign will commence from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will go out of our own house and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
Whether it is home or street or chowk or drain, from schools or colleges, we will launch a massive campaign of cleanliness at all public places.
This time there is a special emphasis on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eliminate single use plastic.
On the second October, when we will commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate him to a free India, but will also lay the foundation of a new folk movement against plastic across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to the residents of small towns, to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a liberation from plastic waste.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, a special festival of Shramdaan should be celebrated.
All municipalities, municipalities, district-rural systems, gram panchayats, government-ruled systems, all organizations, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country,
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, they should come forward and settle down for proper disposal.
It can be recycled.
This can create energy.
In this way, we can also finish the task of safe disposal of plastic waste by this day.
Just need resolution.
There is no need to see an eternality for inspiration.
Who else can be a bigger inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is in a way a composition of knowledge.
We can get what we need in life.
My connectivity with them has come down recently.
But earlier my contact was very high.
Today, I would like to touch a very important issue with a Sanskrit Subhas.
And these are the things written centuries ago but what is the importance of this thing even today
And it is a good description and it has said: Prithvian Trinity Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhasitam, Mudhai: Ratn Sanksha Pradityette of Pashankhand, that it is the three Ratans, water, food and defined in the earth.
The original stone is called Ratn.
There is a lot of food in our culture.
Until then, we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborn children, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and fascinating manner.
Once again, one thing has been brought to my notice.
NASIC has become a big drive for Matthew Dhanya.
Anganwadi workers collect food grains during crop harvesting days.
This cereal is used to make fresh food for children and women.
The person who donates it becomes an awakening citizen, a social worker.
After that, it is also dedicated to this goal and it becomes a sepoy of this movement.
We all have heard about the food-processing culture in the corners of India.
This culture is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative that can be adopted.
In many states, people are running Tithi Food Campaign.
If someone in the family has a good birthday, a good day or a memorable day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food and go to schools and the family members serve, feed, share happiness and increase happiness.
There is a wonderful union of service and joy.
Friends, There are several such small things that our country can fight against malnutrition effectively.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as POSHAN Abhiyaan across the country.
However, I have been associated with the youth of the world and I had never thought that this kind of place would be there in the hearts of our country and the youth of the world.
I had never thought of how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to.
I had never thought that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch the youth of the world.
And just last week I had gone to Bhutan.
I have seen that as Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go anywhere from Jayar. And due to International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I meet and sit in the world then someone asks me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has organized this programme in 165 countries.
Today, when there is a thrust on environment, global warming and climate change, I hope that this programme will greatly help Indias message, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in Indias cultural journey, and the scientific channel of scientific channels to familiarize the world with all these things.
And people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
However, one more interesting thing is that some people ask me simultaneously, Modi Ji tells me that you used to speak Hindi and Bear Grills does not know Hindi, then how could it happen so fast
Or later, it has been edited.
He asks with great curiosity.
Jesus, there is no secret in this.
How many people have this question in their hearts, I can only declare that secret.
If you look at it, it's not a secret.
In fact, technology has been used extensively in consultation with Bear Grills.
There was a simultaneous interaction and a small cordless instrument was put in the ears of Bear Greece, so that it could be incorporated into English.
However, I used to say Hindi but it used to happen in English and due to this the dialogue became easier and this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures.
I have said before and I have stressed upon you that I should definitely go to Ishaan Bharat in your life.
The world inside you will expand.
From the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
Go to 15 such places with the aim of 100 tourism, see, study, take the family and spend some time there.
A country full of diversity, you too will be filled with diversity from within as a teacher.
Your lives will expand.
Your thoughts will be broad.
And trust me that there are places within India from where you will come with new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and inspiration.
Your family will also feel like this.
My dear countrymen, the environmental care and concerns in India are naturally visible.
I was fortunate to announce the number of tigers in the country last month.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
A resolution was taken while expressing concern over the decreasing population of tigers in the world.
The resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India that we are achieving the goal in the future.
We doubled the population of tigers in 2019.
In India, not only tiger population but also the number of reserved areas and community reserved places has increased.
When I was declaring a tiger population, I also remembered the lions of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the area of residence of lions was shrinking in the Gir forest.
Their numbers were declining.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 200, it was decided to remove women guards there.
Infrastructure reforms to increase tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about conservation only.
But now we have to move ahead with conservation and think about the compassionate compassion.
Our classics have received very good guidance in this regard.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Swami Vivekanandji on September 11, 183
The young Sanyasis of India, who tricked the humanity of the entire world, had left India's vibrant identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekanandji had seen India, Swami Vivekananda ji knew the potential of India, let us try to live up to it.
We have everything inside us, let us come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that 2nd August is celebrated as the Sports Day.
On this occasion, Fit India Movement Clean India Campaign will be launched across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you in the POSHAN Abhiyaan in 2nd August, FIT India, in the month of September, and especially in the 2nd October Cleanliness Campaign and the 2nd October fully dedicated to POSHAN Abhiyaan.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, today there is so much in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll meet again.
I will wait for your suggestions, your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters, to realise Gandhi's dreams - Swant-Sukhya, to illuminate the joy of distance by serving us.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, the importance that is given to the rights at all times, the same importance should be given to them.
India's democracy can move forward at a rapid pace only on two pages of rights and duties.
Yesterday is 30th January, the death anniversary of our venerable Bapu.
On 30th January, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping a silence of 2 minutes at 11.
As a society, as a country, on the eleventh day of January, it should be a comfortable tribute to two minutes.
Why not only 2 minutes, but it should also be a tribute to collectivity, determination and martyrdom.
There is a simple respect for the army and the security forces in our country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards include several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Special Service Medal.
I especially urge the youth, you are very active in social media.
You can do one thing The brave men who have received this honour - look at the net, write two good words about it and spread it among your friends.
We are also surprised, proud and inspired when we know the bravery, valour and valour of their courage.
On the one hand, we were all happy to know about the zeal and zeal of 26th January and at that time our soldiers in Kashmir who were in service of the country were brave due to avalanches.
I pay my homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I continue to speak Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are months of Kasauti for every family.
One or two children are tested at home but the entire family is buried under the burden of examination.
So I was convinced that this is the right time that I talk to students friends, talk to their family members, their teachers, because for many years I have visited the place where I have met the exams due to a lot of distress.
A peculiar psychological environment is seen in every household.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to young friends in a very small way.
When I announced this thing, several teachers, students and students sent a message to me, they also expressed their pain and expressed their thoughts and thoughts and thoughts about them, which I would like to talk to you today.
I received a telephone message from the universe.
So I would like to ask you whether this atmosphere cannot be pleasant
The question has been asked by the Christians but you will have this question in your minds.
Exams should be a joyous opportunity themselves.
It should be a festival of enthusiasm and zeal that has worked hard for the entire year, which has now come to be shown.
There are very few people for whom examination is a pleasure, while the examination is a pressure for most people.
It is to be decided that you will be happy to accept the pressure.
The one who believes in happiness will achieve it and the pressure that he takes will prefer.
And that is why I believe that examination is a festival, take the examination in such a way that when there is a festival, when there is a festival then the best thing in us comes out.
The strength of the society is also felt at the time of the festival.
Whatever is best, we generally feel that how disgusting we are, but if we look at the arrangements for the 40-45-day Kumbh Congregation, we will realise what is the Make Shift Arrangement and what is the discipline of the people.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the examination, there should be a festival of neighbours in the entire family and friends.
You will see that this pressure will be transformed into happiness.
Festivals will make the atmosphere free of burden.
And I would like to urge my parents here to make a festival for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to change these three-four months every year by understanding our traditions and understanding the atmosphere of our family to the festival.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see yourself relaxed, you easily get relaxed and when you are relaxed, you will also easily recall your years old things.
A year ago, what the teacher had said in the classroom would be remembered.
And you should know that the strength to recollection memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door is closed, it does not go out and it does not come out.
The thought process stops, which automatically becomes a bogey.
You must have seen in the examination that you remember everything, the chopper is remembered, the subject is remembered, the leaflet is remembered, it is written upwards in the leaves that it is also remembered downwards.
Why wasn't it remembered inside, there was pressure
But the inner one came out immediately and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why it is relaxation if there is any medicine that is the biggest recall of Memory.
And on the basis of self-confidence, I say that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there is a relax, we never imagine it and suddenly we remember things that are very useful.
And it is not that you don't have knowledge, it is not that you don't have information, you don't work hard.
But when you are tensed, your knowledge, your information is suppressed and your tension is overwhelmed.
And that is why it is essential that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the test in the true perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life and death.
The examination that you are going to give is a test of the entire year.
This is not the destruction of your life.
What kind of life you live, how you are living, how you want to lead a life is not tested.
In your life, apart from the examinations given in the classroom notebooks, there must have been a lot of opportunities to pass through the casualties.
And that is why we should be free from the burden of the success and failure of our lives.
In front of us, our former President Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalamji is a great inspirational example.
Anand ji has sent a question to me: Today, if I see the biggest challenge before education, I can see that education has become centred.
uality has become the most important.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the tension among the students.
I want to know your thoughts about this present direction of education and its future.
Though he himself has answered, he wants to share my thoughts here.
Marx and Markshit are very limited uses.
There is nothing like that in life.
How much knowledge you have gained, you people live on it.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, lives on it.
The sense of mission that you have received, that is your service of ambition, whether there is any link between your mission or ambition or not, lives on it.
If you believe in such matters, then Marx will be behind you with a tail, you will not be required to run behind Marcus.
You will have knowledge, expertise, self-confidence and determination in your life.
You tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family member will visit him who is a family doctor.
No one of you would have asked his family doctor how many qualities he had passed.
No one has asked.
Brothers and sisters, you are very good as a doctor, you are benefiting and you have started taking care of them.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer 
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why the strength of these qualities sometimes stops us from moving towards the right direction.
But this does not mean that I have said that it is not just reading.
Its use is essential for our waste.
I was yesterday and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes it happens and if you look at your own life from close proximity then it will be noticed that if you fall behind the qualities then you will find a short way, you will catch a few select things and you will focus on them only.
But if you focus on the qualities, then gradually you are constraining yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get the mark.
It may be that in spite of being conscious in the examination, there is a failure in life.
Rekha ji has also said one thing: Competition
This is a very big psychological battle.
Indeed, competition does not work to lead a life, it is a competition to move ahead, and when I talk about it, it means to compete with myself.
How to be better tomorrow than yesterday 
One of the special features of the life of most successful players is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Friends in every sphere of life, when you are going to examine then imagine, if you can read peacefully for two hours then can you study for three hours
S.
Sundarji has expressed his feelings on the role of girls.
They say that the role of girls in the examination is very important.
He has written more - My mother was not supposed to be guessed, but she used to sit with me and tell me to be guessed.
Because mothers are conscious about the future of the households, they are active, they make things very easy.
Once you learn to accept it, most of the problems will be solved there itself.
Every evening it feels that it will be experienced.
Friends, the expectations of the teachers are at the root of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
Expectations make it difficult.
Accepting the situation gives an opportunity to open a new path.
And therefore accept what is happening.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come there and asked a question about his health.
We didn't talk about the situation, the disease and the situation in the place of sitting and coming.
We started to talk about it and in the first two-four minutes it made the weather lighter.
We go to a sick person and frequently scare him with disease.
I would like to tell the brides that sometimes we do the same with our children.
Does he ever feel that during the days of examination do we give laughter to the children 
You see, the weather will change.
I have come to the phone call of a miracle.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot mention my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to pass by nakedly, I got caught in it and because of me, many friends around me faced a lot of difficulty.
You must have often heard that don't worry, don't steal.
I am also telling you the same thing again.
Once there is a habit of stealing, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach 
If you read the entire creativity of these things in the preparation of the examinations then perhaps you will not need to imitate them.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that arises during our examination and my second question is, or why do we feel lighter thanks to you.
If there is holistic development then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Someone says that before I pass all these examinations, I will play.
So it's impossible.
The rest of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever imagined that when there are so many things in front then take a few moments out to the sky and take a little bit of trees and plants to lighten your hearts.
By doing this you will see that once again you will come back in your rooms and in your books.
Whatever you are doing, keep it for a while, stand up, go to the kitchen, look for the cheese of your choice, if you get a future biscuit, then eat.
Why not just for five minutes, but take some breaks.
There is no need to stay closed in any room for deep breathing .
Go slightly below the sky, go to the bottom of the sky, breathe deeply for five minutes and then sit back to study.
You will feel that the body will become very light and body will not only become light but it will also make the brain light .
Some people feel that I will wake up for a long time in the night - I will read more and more.
Definitely take as much sleep as you need .
Fresh.
Your efficiency will gradually increase significantly.
Whenever I hold meetings at the time of election, sometimes I sweat.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me - How many hours do you sleep
He gave me a mess.
In fact, if we understand the significance of these things then it will benefit us.
But this does not mean that just staying asleep .
Without doing so, the people of your family will disappoint me.
And I will show you the day your marksheet arrives.
The person who plays, shines is a very big medicine to keep the mind, intelligence and body alert.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not let the words I have said become a burden.
So, I also feel that the way I advise your family not to become a bogey.
Keeping faith in yourself by remembering your pledge go for examination .
My best wishes.
Make a festival to cross every corner of the country.
Then there will never be any bitterness.
Take this mantra forward.
Dear Countrymen, forty years are being completed by the Indian Coast Guard in February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and soldiers of the Coast Garden for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place in the world's four largest coast guard with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, the people of Coast Garden had carried out a massive campaign to clean the coast of our country along with their responsibilities and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people would be aware that not only men in the Coast Guard in our country but women are also equally responsible for their responsibility.
Coast Garden is also an Observer of our women officers, and is also an Observer.
Today, when maritime security is an important topic in the entire world, I congratulate him on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard engaged in maritime security of India.
On 1st February, Bhubaneswar is the festival of Panchami.
Bastar has been approved as the best season.
Wet weather is the queen of seasons.
The occasion of worship of Vidya is celebrated.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the brave.
My Rang de Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Champaran Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani always fills new forms with its imagination.
Immediately after the completion of my thoughts from last month, he started talking about Mann Ki Baat in regional languages.
It has received wide acceptance.
People are writing letters from far and wide.
I congratulate the Akashwani for its self-inspirational work.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all of you on Christmas.
Today is an occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Lord Jesus said that the poor don't want us to accept that in the Gospel of St. Luke, Lord Christ not only serves the poor but also preaches the service done by the poor. This is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
In the story, it is said that Lord Jesus stood by the threshold of a temple.
Several immense people came there and they made unwavering donations.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and gave two compartments as a donation.
In such a scenario, two copper coins are not very big donations.
It is very natural for the devotees to be there.
Lord Jesus said that this woman has donated the most because all others have contributed a lot in donations but this woman has dedicated herself to the supreme sacrifice.
Today is also the birth anniversary of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviyaji gave a new direction to modern teachings to raise awareness of resolve and self-confidence among Indian public.
Just two days back, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Malaviyaji's penance ground in Banaras.
I have laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre will be an important boon not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the country by achieving success in the nuclear energy sector.
Whether it is the leader of the party or the member of the parliament or the minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji has established an idealism in every role.
I bow to Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
A lot of memories are swimming with them.
Today, on the day of Christmas, as a gift, the countrymen will get the benefit of two schemes.
In another way, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is village or city, whether it is educated or uneducated, how cashless trade is going on, how can it be purchased without cash
Everybody wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, to make mobile banking more robust, two new incentive schemes for e-payments are being launched by the Government of India, for customers and small traders from today.
One scheme to encourage customers - Lucky Consumer Scheme and another scheme to promote traders - Digidhan Business Scheme
Today, on 25th December, as a gift of Christmas, fifteen thousand people will receive prizes from the draw system and one thousand rupees will be paid in the accounts of those fifteen thousand people.
Fifteen thousand people will get a prize of one thousand rupees per day.
In 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive gifts worth crores of rupees but this prize will be made when you will use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD, and will be drawn on the basis of that.
With this, there will be a one-day big draw for such customers, including prizes for lakhs and three months later, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a bumper draw with crores of prizes.
DigiDhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen themselves join this scheme and also connect consumers to make their own business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and the prize will be in thousands.
Merchants will also carry out their own businesses and also receive prize winners.
This scheme has been created by keeping every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class at the centre. And that is why people will get the benefit of this scheme if they purchase something above 50 rupees and purchase less than three thousand rupees.
More than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this prize.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through featured phones, ordinary phones and sell goods and also pay the money.
People in rural areas can also buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win prizes.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youngsters around you must be aware of it, you can ask them and they will definitely explain it to you.
Your family will also have children studying in class 10-12. Those people will also be able to easily learn this thing.
Its very simple - just as you send a message from a mobile phone, it is an easy task.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to do e-payment and how to do online payments.
In the last few days, cashless trade, cashless trade has increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
This decision is so big that traders can apply it very well.
Traders who do digital transactions, who will replace their business with online payments, have been exempted from incompetence.
Everyone has taken this campaign forward in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu, has appointed a committee, which is considering several schemes in this regard.
However, I have noticed that several state governments have started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Government of Assam has decided to give a 10 discount on the digital payment of Property Tax and Trade License fees.
The Branch of Rural Banks, which will provide at least two digital transactions of 5 of their customers in the period January to March, will receive a prize of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
The Government has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh under the Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transactions to 100 digital transaction villages by 31st March, 2019.
Under the Digital Agricultural Shiromani for the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5000 to 10 farmers who will be fully utilized for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to every government that has initiated such a good start.
Several institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital procurement among the rural poor farmers.
I have come to know that GNFC - Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited, which works mainly on fertilizers, has installed one thousand POS machines where they are sold for fertilizers and 35 thousand farmers have been given 5 lakh fertilizers through digital mode and this work has been done in the last two weeks.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, the informal sector is very big. And most of the people have to pay the wages of wages, money or money in cash alone.
Where they get 100 rupees, they get 80, they get 50 where they get 80, and there are other facilities in the health sector like insurance, they remain deprived of it.
But now the cashless payment is being made.
The money is being directly deposited in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the absorption is being stopped, the cut-offs are also being stopped and it has become possible for the workers, the artisans and the ordinary people to get the full support.
Besides, they are also entitled to other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology has made us easier.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress from startups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should not only strengthen this sector with new ideas, with new technologies, but also with the drive to free the country from black money and corruption.
Most of the people in the class of other writers have pointed out that the work of such good work, the work of the country's shape, the work of such a sacred task, however, however, people have also mentioned about the way in which there are barriers, how new ways are being searched for wrongdoings.
And the third stage is that people have supported what is happening, but along with this fight should be carried forward, corruption and black money should be eradicated.
I am grateful to the countrymen that I have helped in writing so many letters.
Shri Gurumani K. on May Gov has written: "This step to curb contemporary finance is commendable.
We are distressed by the citizens, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support we are making in this fight.
We are fighting like armed forces against corruption, black money etc. The same sentiment that Garumani Kebel ji has written is being reflected in the corners of the country.
We are all feeling it.
But it is also true that when people suffer, they endure difficulties, who is such a person who does not have pain
I feel the same pain as you suffer.
But for a better end, for a higher objective, when work is done with good intentions, the countrymen remain courageous in the midst of these sufferings, in the midst of pain.
In fact, these people are the foremost of change.
I also express my gratitude to the people for another reason that they have not only made troubles, but have also given a condolence reply to some people who are trying to defame the people.
It is also going to be repealed that the spelling on the note is wrong, someone has said that the price of salt has increased, someone is going to spread some rumors, 200 notes are going to be postponed, 500 and 100 notes are going to be canceled.
I also salute the people for this strength.
My dear countrymen, I can clearly feel that there is nothing impossible when 1. 25 billion Indians are with you.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country, I congratulate them that people have participated in this magnificence of corruption and black money.
There will be widespread discussions in the Parliament for political parties as well as for the allocations made to political parties.
If the Parliament was going on, it would have been a good discussion.
Those people who are spreading rumors, all the discrepancies to political parties are wrong.
Those who cannot support open corruption and black money have been searching for government errors all the time.
This government is for the masses.
The government is constantly trying to imagine the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the very first day, on the eighth day, that this fight is extraordinary.
For 70 years, the power of those who have been involved in black money and corruption is very strong.
Whenever I have decided to meet such people, they also adopt a new approach to defeating the government.
I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to all my fellow citizens.
How did this become possible 
Let me tell you its mystery.
The secret is that I am getting all this information from the people.
Many more important citizens are getting more information from the government system than from the citizens and most of us are getting success because of the awareness of ordinary citizens.
Can any citizen of my country imagine the dangers being faced by such elements
And most of the information that is being received is getting success.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can also send it to me.
You can also send it to Maya Goa.
There is also a third group of writers who are also in large numbers.
He says: Modiji will not get tired, will not stop, and you will be able to take as much steps as you have to take, but now once you have taken the road, we have to reach Manjil.
I am particularly grateful to all those who write such letters because there is a sense of confidence and blessing in their letters.
And there is no question of returning to the work that has the blessings of 1. 25 billion Indians.
We have expelled it and have enacted a multi-stakeholder Benami Wealth Act.
These laws will also work in the coming days.
Our priority is to do whatever is required for the benefit of the nation, for the benefit of the people.
My dear countrymen, I had said in Mann Ki Baat last month that even in the midst of these difficulties, our farmers have broken the records of last year by working hard.
This is a good sign in terms of agriculture.
Be it the labourers of this country, the farmers of this country, the youth of this country, the hard work of all these people is bringing a new color today.
In the past, on the global economic platform, India has made its name very glorious in many fields.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In the Global Innovation Index-2016, we have improved 16 places and the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index has improved by 1 in 2016.
There are several reports that have been evaluated in this direction and India is progressing at a fast pace.
The President, the Vice President also expressed his disapproval.
However, in such a situation, there are some good things, and then there is a great satisfaction in the mind.
There was also an excellent work in the midst of Hobala of the Parliament, which the country did not pay attention to.
Brothers and sisters, Today I feel very proud to mention this thing that a bill related to Divyangjan was passed in the Parliament.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to the crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to Divyangjans.
I have also personally tried to make it more sensitive.
I hope that Divyangjans get their rights and respect, which they are entitled to.
Our efforts and confidence were strengthened by our Divyang brothers and sisters when they won four medals in the Paralympics.
He not only enhanced the dignity of the country but also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, we have an invaluable legacy.
I am happy to note that after the passage of this Act in the interest of Divyangjans, Divyangjans will have more job opportunities.
For them, the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides for special provisions for redressal of education, provisions and grievances of persons with disabilities.
You can guess how sensitive the government is for the Divyangjans that in the last two years the central government has organized four thousand three hundred and fifty camps for the Divyangjans and has distributed resources to 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs. 352 crores.
The government has passed new laws in accordance with the spirit of nationalism.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have come to know from the field of sports that has made us proud.
Being an Indian, it is natural for all of us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four-party anti-England categories.
Some young sportspersons were eligible for their performance.
Virat Kohli of the test dry, along with good betting, also led a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Team Officer R.
Ashwin has been declared as the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016.
My best wishes to all of you - many congratulations.
Even in the field of hockey, very good news came after fifteen years.
Our Junior Hockey team conquered the World Cup.
After fifteen years, this opportunity came when the Junior Hockey team won the world.
Congratulations to the youngsters for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also made a fun of them.
Indias women hockey team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days back, Indias women hockey team won a bronze in the Asia Cup for players under the age of 18.
I heartily congratulate all the cricketers and hockey teams.
Last month, all of us were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the jawans.
With the ITBP jawans and the army personnel, I considered the Himalayas as a day-long Diwali.
He was full of emotions and not only this, it was a wonderful reflection of the country's security forces in their happiness and happiness that the countrymen had sent a message of good wishes.
And people did not just send messages but they were connected with their hearts.
Someone made a video that means almost every household became the guardian of the soldiers.
And whenever I used to see those letters, I was also surprised to see how many ideas, how many emotions were filled. And from that I thought that Mygov should make a coffee table book by finishing a few select items.
Work is underway.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of all of you about the feelings of the soldiers of the country and your feelings towards the security forces of the country will be integrated into this scripture.
But the truth is, this time it did not seem like this.
This time it did not seem that there was a festival and I was not at home.
It seemed as if we are also celebrating this day with crores of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crores.
Just a while ago, I had come to visit all the Sarpanches of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much love, with so much lavishness these Sarpanches of the villages talked and everything touched my heart.
I requested them to go and focus their attention on the future of these children.
Today, I am glad that all the Sarpanches from the Kashmir valley have fulfilled the promises made to me and made all the people aware by visiting the villages.
Just a few days ago, when the board was tested, about 95 percent of the students and students from Kashmir participated in the examination of the Board.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through a bright future, through education.
I congratulate him for his zeal but I congratulate his parents, his sons, his teachers and Sarpanches from all the villages.
Dear brothers and sisters, When I asked people for a suggestion for Mann Ki Baat then I can say that all the suggestions came in one direction.
Everyone used to say that they should talk in detail about 500 and one thousand notes.
However, on the 8th of November, when I was addressing the nation in the name of the nation, I had talked about launching a massive campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
However, the more important the decision is, the more important it is.
And I was convinced that we will have to face many new challenges in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
The diseases that we have been suffering from forty-five years cannot be simplified.
I can understand your problems and telephone well.
However, when I seek your support, I see your support, many efforts are being made to frustrate you, even then sometimes the incidents that disturb the mind, you have understood this path of truth, you have well accepted this thing of the interest of the country to stop the notes of five hundred thousand rupees.
And such a large country, such a large number of notes, absorbed notes, and this decision-making decision-making world is very closely watching, every economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The whole world is witnessing the fact that whether India's 1. 25 billion Indians will succeed even by taking up problems and telephone calls
There may be questions in the minds of the world.
India has only a reverence for millions and millions of Indians and it is a belief that every citizen of India will fulfill his resolve.
And our country will come out with penance and penance in every way like gold and the reason for this is the citizens of this country.
This path of success has also become possible due to you.
Over the country, the central government, the state governments, all the local bodies, lakhs of bank employees in one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of a variety of tensions, all these people are working very quietly to treat it as a yagna of service to the nation and as an attempt to bring about a great change.
They don't even know when they start in the morning, but they are doing everything.
And that is why India will succeed in this thing.
And I have seen that all the people of Banks and Post Offices are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And if we talk about humanity then they can see two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old brother was accidentally killed in Khandah.
Suddenly there was a need for funds.
This thing came to the notice of the local bank employees and I was very happy to know that they had brought money to their homes, to the old man so that he could help in the treatment.
In such a scenario, countless cases come out daily in TV, media, newspapers and interviews.
I end my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have worked hard in this magnificent edition.
Shakti should be quenched only when we cross the threshold.
I clearly remember that the campaign for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was going on and the way the bank employees had taken it on their shoulders and the work that was not done in the last seventy years was done by them.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of crores of Indians, the collective strength of all, will make this nation a new strength.
They are searching for a miserable way to save their money.
Sadly, they have also taken the path by using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing something with them.
I would like to tell such people today that it is your obligation to amend or not to adhere to the law, it is your obligation to adhere to it, the law will see what to do.
But please do not shy away from the lives of the poor.
You don't do anything so that the name of the poor comes on record and later when checked, my beloved poor people get stuck in trouble because of your sin.
And there has been such a rigid law of Benami property that is being implemented in it, it will be very difficult and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name is Ashish Pare.
I am a common citizen of Tirali Village, Tirali Taluko, Harda District, Madhya Pradesh.
I want several examples of Mann Ki Baat saying that people have welcomed this tough decision for the advancement of their nation despite being indiscriminate, which will enhance the enthusiasm of the people and the cashless system is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have stopped the notes of thousands and five hundred rupees.
I call Yelapp Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to you because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
Five hundred thousand notes, black money makers and corrupt people have been taught after seeing all this.
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this.
I would like to thank you very much for this thing.
Some things are known through the medium of media, through the medium of people, through the medium of government sources, the enthusiasm to work is enhanced.
It is so enjoyable that I feel so proud that how the common man has a unique potential in my country.
If you go to the ground and get the opportunity to go through this route then you must pay the money.
And people go there, they go there and after a couple of days when they go back then they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss the issue in the elections and this thing had reached all over the world.
People from many countries of the world have also learnt to speak words on 'Chairman'.
But I didn't know that there would be a marriage in the discussion.
I came to know that on November 17, there was a marriage in Surat that came up with discussions on Cha.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea only to the people who had married her and spent no other expense.
My dear brothers and sisters of Surat who have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriages, have inspired them.
When I was late at night, I used to watch TV, I saw in the news that there is a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam.
There are artisans of tea gardens and they get money every week.
What did they do if they got a note of Rs. 2,000
Four women from the neighbourhood got together and shopped around and paid two thousand rupees in a note so they did not need a small note because they purchased together and decided that when we meet next week, we will sit and watch.
People are searching for their own paths.
And see the change.
A message came to the government that the people of the tea gardens of Assam are saying that we have ATMs there.
See how the lives of the villages are also changing.
Some people have got the immediate benefit of this campaign.
The country will get benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipality gets fifty percent tax incurred on taxes.
However, due to this decision on the 8th of this year, all the people started running to collect their old notes.
Last year, about three-and-a-half thousand crore rupees were levied in 47 urban units.
You will be surprised to know that in the same week 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited.
Now if it comes to four times the money in the municipal corporation then it is natural that there will be a rock system in the poor population, there will be water management and anganwadi arrangements will be made.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are seen.
Brothers and sisters, Our village and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, because of these new changes in the economy, every citizen is streamlining himself in the midst of difficulties.
Farmers have also found ways in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority but still there are difficulties, but I believe that if there is any problem in the farmers, if there is an obstruction in natural calamities, this time too.
Small traders of our country, who are employed, also increase economic activity.
In the last budget, we had taken an important decision that like the big Mall, the small shopkeepers of the villages will now be able to do their business for twenty four hours, no law can stop them because I believe that if the big Mall gets 24 hours then why should the poor shopkeepers of the villages not get it
A big initiative has been taken to provide loans to them through Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been delivered to such small people through Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small businesses and boost the business of billions of rupees.
However, it is natural for them to face difficulties due to this decision.
You can also download the Banks App in mobile phones.
You should also set up POS machines for credit cards, learn how to do business without a note.
Technological roads are safe and fast.
I would like you not only to help in making this campaign a success but also to lead your transformation and I am confident that you can lead a change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the entire village business.
I would also like to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a revision on paper and when it comes in hand then it is different.
Sometimes there is a lot of money and sometimes it has to be shared by someone outside and labour force makes this accusation a part of life.
With this new system, we want you to be in the bank, your salary money will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
Nowadays your mobile phones are also working on e-packets. You can buy the same mobile phones from the small shops in the neighborhood.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to be a participant in this scheme because I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the underprivileged and the victims of the country which they should benefit from.
Today, I specially want to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 percent of the population below 35 years of age.
Young and youngsters of my country, I know that you must have liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are also contributing sufficiently to this thing in a positive way.
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India and have got the opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can my youngsters help me
You will accompany me, you will not stop talking so much.
The more experience you have in today's world, the older generation is not that much.
It may be that the elder brothers of your family are not aware of it and parents, poets, mothers and sisters may not be aware of it.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is done.
All these things are very common for you and you also use them but today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream.
A hundred percent cashless society is not possible, but whether India launches a Less Cash Society.
Once we start the 'Lace Cash Society' today, the Manzil of the Cashless Society will not be far away and I will see your physical help, your time and your resolve in it.
And I believe that you will never disappoint me because we all want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, today there are many opportunities for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Each bank provides online access.
The direct meaning of the ballot is e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and after 8th, the RuPay cards used very little.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and it has registered an increase of about 300.
Similarly, in the same way, printed cards are available in mobile phones, printed cards are also available for spending money in banks.
There is a good platform for doing business which you can buy, send money, and money. And it is easy for you to do as much as you are sending on WhatsApp.
Saava would have been an uneducated person, how he can send messages on WhatsApp today.
Not only this, technology will be so simple that there is no need for a big smartphone for this purpose.
Every bank has also felt it and now it has eradicated the cost of online surcharge and it has also been seen that in 2-4 days every expenditure has been abolished in newspapers so that the movement of cashless society can be strengthened.
My young friends, despite all this, there is a generation that is unaware of it.
And as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
I see the way creative messages have been sent to you on WhatsApp, slogans, poems, questions, cartoons, new imaginations, and the creativity of our youth in the midst of a lot of troubles, it seems that India is the landmark of the fact that the songs were born in the battlefield of India, in the same way, today we are passing through such a massive transformational period, then there will be original creativity within you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I want your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I reiterate that I need your help and I am confident that crores of youth of my country will do this work.
Please do one thing, resolve from today itself that you will become a part of the cashless society yourself.
All the technologies that are available online on your mobile phones are available.
Moreover, what is the technology for at least 10 families taking out half an hour or two hours a day, how to use technology, how to download their bank's app and how to spend the money in your account
How can shopkeepers also be trained or traded
You will voluntarily lead this Cashless Society, the campaign to bring the country out of the dilemma of these notes, the campaign to make the country free from corruption, the campaign to make black money free, the campaign to make people free from problems and difficulties.
Once you people are taught how to use RuPay cards then the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens are educated then perhaps they will get rid of all their concerns. And if all the youth of India come forward in this work then I dont think it will take longer.
Within a month, we will be able to emerge as a new modern India in the world and this can be done through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 households everyday and add 10 households to this.
I would like to invite you, let us not only support but we will also be an army of this transformation and a transformation.
We will move ahead with this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there is a wealthy country in the world where the youth of that country has changed the lives of that nation.
M-PESA used the technologies of such a mobile system, named M-PESA and today almost the entire business of this region of Africa has come upon it.
This country has made a big revolution.
My young men, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
Every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, collectively, I invite you to do this work personally.
We will carry this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the best of the country, not to miss the opportunity.
Dear brothers and sisters, today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan for this cleanliness drive.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, has been taking forward the cleanliness drive very well.
It seems that the theme of cleanliness has spread to his nervousness and at the same time he also remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through this.
His son, Shriman Amitabh ji, who is running a mission of cleanliness in his nursing, has sent me through the poems of Harivansh Rai ji, Swachh Taan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, Mera Acquaintance.
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai ji.
I also express my gratitude to Shriman Amitabh ji for this kind of work in Mann Ki Baat and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, feelings, your letters, on MyGov, Narendra Modi app always keeps me connected with you.
Now at 11 o'clock Mann Ki Baat, but soon after that we will start in regional languages as well.
I am grateful to the people of Akashwani for the new initiative that they have taken so that the people of my country will definitely get the opportunity to connect with it where there is no Hindi language.
Thank you very much to everyone.
The people from far flung areas feel as if they are the second name of the festival of life in India and it is natural.
Festivals that have been a tradition of India since time immemorial have been a celebration of time-bound change.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of out-of-the-box festivals and changes have also been easily adopted in the festivals as per the demands of time and society.
And do it through these festivals.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
Today, the whole world discusses the environment, it becomes a matter of natural destruction.
India's festival is a tradition that strengthens nature's love and cultures every person from child to child.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has a feeling of responsibility.
Nowadays we keep on Sundays, but those older generations, workers, fishermen etc. .
So far, we had developed a tradition of keeping silver and science together.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, our festival is an educational festival.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India, from Amir to the house of Amir, from the poorest of the poor to the hut of the poor, from the festivals of Deepawali, every family gets to see the cleanliness drive.
Cleaning of houses is done.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean our houses but also to clean the entire complex, to clean the entire area and to clean the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer confined to the borders of India.
Anyone in all the countries of the world is remembered or celebrated as Dipawali.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world have also started becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
Whether it is east or west, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the smoke of Diwali is visible.
You must be aware that the US Postal Service of America has also released Diwali postage stamps this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his pictures on Diu on Diwas.
The Prime Minister of Britain, on the occasion of Deepawali in London, organized a warm and friendly programme to connect all societies, he personally took part in it and perhaps the U.
And what is the picture 
16 women MPs from Singapore, wearing Indian sarees, are standing outside the Parliament and these pictures have been wired.
And all this has been done on the occasion of Diwali.
Today, the festival of Deepavali is being celebrated in every street hall of Singapore.
Australian Prime Minister extended his best wishes to the Indian community on Diwali celebrations in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand had come.
He told me that I have to return so soon that I am going to participate in the festival of Deepawali, I mean that Deepawali, this festival of light, is also an inspiration to take the world community from darkness to light.
On the festival of Deepavali along with good clothes , good food habits , etc . heavy smoke of crackers also forms .
And children and youth are very happy.
No matter what is there in the vicinity .
In the days of Diwali, news of accidents, news of fire and death are causing serious concern.
And one problem also arises that doctors have also gone to celebrate Deepawali with their families in large numbers on the day of Diwali.
In our country, the festival of Deepawali is very long.
It is not just a day.
Govardhan worship in it, say brothers, say beneficiary Pancham and take it to the Prakash Parv of Kartik Purnima.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern regions of India.
But it is a special feature that it gives a lot of messages to the society.
But the question is, Brother, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped.
There is a very big social message in this festival ...
Let me talk about the festival of Deepawali, let us talk about Chhath Puja, let us convey my best wishes to you all.
But at the same time, I have a special time.
Especially to the countrymen, we have to thank and express our gratitude.
In the events that have taken place in the last few months, our army personnel have been unfolding their credibility for our well-being.
The sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the armed forces on my future world continues.
And one of these things came to mind that this day should be dedicated to the defence forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Message to Soldiers.
But today I would like to say by saluting my head that there should not be any such person of India who has an unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country, who is proud of the army, the way it has been expressed, it gives strength to every citizen of the country.
We cannot imagine for the soldiers of the security forces, it has emerged as one of your messages to enhance the courage.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a businessman, a shopkeeper, a politician, a sportsperson or a sportsperson or a sportsperson, who has not published a lamp for the country's soldiers, who have not given a message to the country's soldiers, and even the media has changed this Deepotsav into an opportunity to express gratitude towards the army and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Jal Shakti or Air Force or Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all but what kind of sufferings do we have innumerable soldiers
I can imagine this moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
There have been so many acts on the Message to Soldiers ' hashtag , reflectively or what to talk about .
I would like to read that poem has been sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan.
Sisters, Shiva has sent me a telephone message, what do we call the Fauzi family
Namaskar Prime Minister, I bow to Shiva.
Our army brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the message to solar mission that has been launched on this day.
I belong to a martial family.
My husband is also an officer of the armed forces.
My father and mother-in-law have been the officers of both the armed forces.
The entire family is full of soldiers.
I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also offer such sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the army personnel are not only on the border but also on every corner of their lives.
Whether it is natural calamities, if it is a law and order situation, if it is a threat to the enemy or to show courage to return the youth who are on the wrong path, our youth continues to work with inspiration from the patriotism at every turn of their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from falling into the open - open defecation free.
Now Himachal has also been formed and Kerala is going to be the first number.
But how can this success be seen 
Now these ITBP personnel went to the village on leave from their duty.
So perhaps in the village there was a need to meet the village councils at that time, they had reached the village councils and discussions were going on to build toilets.
It was found that some families were not able to make toilets due to lack of money.
And see their patriotic vision, it is not like that they served the country only by leaving pills on enemies.
He took out thousands of rupees from his chequebook and handed it over to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those five households do not have toilets, give one thousand rupees to every family, make five toilets and make all our villages open to trees.
I am really grateful to the youth.
I noticed that there is no road in the far flung jungles of Kerala and it can be reached with difficulty if you walk on foot all day long.
It was difficult to reach Idmalakudi, the tribal Panchayat, so people did not go there, it was noticed by the engineering students in the nearby urban areas that they had to construct toilets in this village.
Candidates from NCC, youngsters from NSS and engineering students have decided that we will build toilets.
These youngsters who had to carry the goods that they had to make toilets, they took up the intents, cements and goods and walked the entire day in the Pela forest.
They worked hard and made toilets in the village and these youngsters freed the open defecation of such a small village in remote forests.
This is the reason that Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat too has declared more than 150 municipalities Open Defecation Free.
Ten districts have also been declared open defecation free.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on the first of its kind and it has been decided that the entire state will be ODF within a few months.
So far, they have completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I convey my best wishes to all the citizens of these states for their contribution in connecting with this great work and eliminating filthy darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and if there is another good scheme in accordance with this scheme then we have to launch the first scheme.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
Old schemes are also going on and new schemes are going on and the plans are also waiting for them to come.
This continues.
Houses that have gas connections in our country, which have electricity in their homes, do not need kerosene.
The households that have gas connections, the households that have electricity, have been disposed off from Aadhaar number and I have heard that seven or eight districts have been evacuated from kerosene by now.
The way they took up this task, I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene free.
And it will also increase the convenience of the people, yes, it will be difficult, it will be difficult for the common man, it will be difficult for the criminals.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Where should the country go And even today the criteria for all of them are set.
Gandhiji used to say: Whenever you plan, first of all, remember the poor and the weak faces and then decide whether the poor will be benefitted by what you are going to do or not
You decide on the basis of this criteria.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the difficulties.
Whatever our old thinking may be, the society must be freed from the discrimination of daughter-in-law.
The 21st century and the darkness in the village cannot be moved now.
And that is why the great campaign of providing electricity to the villages is successfully moving forward to make the villages free from darkness.
Time is moving ahead in terms of time.
After so many years of independence, what will be the health of the poor mother, if she smokes 400 cigarettes in her body by cooking the kitchen on the wooden stove
5 crore such families have been successfully moving forward to provide a life free from humidity.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk holders, nymphony shopkeepers were trapped in the interests of the priests.
My dear countrymen, yesterday, 31st October, the great man of this country made India the mantra of his life.
31st October is the festival of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the living man of unity of the country.
On the other hand, Smt. Gandhi also has a death anniversary.
We should not only remember the blessings of the great men, but also do it.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain and suffering touched me too.
From Punjab, sir, you know that Sardar Patel's birthday is on the 31st of December.
Sardar Patel is such a delusion that he spent his entire life connecting the country and he feels that he has succeeded and brought everyone along with him.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
A Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is a testimony to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did the job of uniting the country after Chanakya.
A successful effort to bring down the freedom struggle under one flag, the great personality who did such a great job, bowed down to the great man.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb was alive for unity, he was hunting for unity, because of his priorities, because of his priorities, how many anonymity he never forgot the path of unity.
The birth anniversary of that great man who lives for the sake of unity, and the birth anniversary of Sardar Saradhara, a philosopher of history afflicts us all.
But we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity in the midst of these difficulties.
Unity in diversity is the strength of that country.
Whether there are many languages, varieties, dresses, eating and drinking, but unity in diversity, this is the strength of India.
The root of unity gives a strong foundation for a better India.
Sardar Saheb's journey of life began with a struggle for farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sometimes many of us hear the name of Amul.
Every manufacturing of Amul is familiar with the people of India and outside India today.
However, very few people would be aware that it was the divine vision of Sardar Saheb who imagined the cooperative milk producing federation.
And sports districts, which were then called Kera Districts, were strengthened in 1942.
In fact, we have a living example of how Sardar Saheb had made sand for the farmers of Amul today.
I pay my homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on 31st October, whenever we may remember Sardar Saheb, let us resolve to unite.
My dear countrymen, in this series of Deepawali festivals, there is also a festival of lighting of Kartiki Purnima (Devali).
Guru Nanakdev, his Bodh is a guide not only for the entire human race, but also for the entire human race.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the forefront of the distortion, casteism, sectarianism, height and deformity, Guru Nanak Dev was chosen as his companion.
If we move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', the inspiration that Guru Nanak Dev has given us to discriminate, then who can be our guide
I also bow down to Guru Nanak Dev, when this light of his birth anniversary is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the countrymen on this Diwali.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir last days.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
It was sufficient to embarrass the entire nation.
There is also grief and anger in the country. And it is not only for those families who have lost their sons, brothers and sisters, the entire country has lost their loved ones.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our forces.
We have a lot of opportunities to speak to citizens and politicians, we also speak.
But the army doesn't speak, the army doesn't fight.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national disabilities very well.
And as soon as they have started to understand the truth, they have taken such things away from themselves and gone out on the path of peace.
Every parent wants to work as fast as school-colleges, farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. which have been produced can reach the markets across India.
Financial activities are also well pursued.
And in the last few days, cars have been started well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, the path of our progress and the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will sit together to find solutions to every problem, take the path and at the same time pav the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that rule.
Administrative systems have to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will follow it completely.
Sometimes people who think Judas are also innovative because of what we think.
I get the opportunity to know a lot about the recent social media.
Every nook and corner of India has the opportunity to know, understand and understand the emotions of all kinds of people and it strengthens the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th standard had given me a different idea.
He has written, I was very distraught after my terrorist attack.
But the way to do something is bathed and what can a small student like me do
Of these, I was wondering how I could work for the country's interests.
And I have resolved that I will do 3 hours extra exercise every day.
The country will become an appropriate citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of joy for me that in this environment of anger, in such a young age, you can imagine healthily.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
But you would be aware of the fact that when the 165 war took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji was leading us and there was such a spirit in the entire country, it was a zeal and zeal of patriotism.
Everybody wanted something or the other. He wanted to get rid of something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji made a tremendous effort to touch this feeling of the country in a very good manner.
And he inspired the people of the country by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, how to work for the country.
Another way of expressing patriotism is for every citizen, said Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
While Mahatma Gandhi was also leading the freedom movement, when the movement was at its peak and there was a need for a stability in the movement, he used to do his best to turn the intensity of the movement towards constructive work in the society.
If all of us, the army assumes responsibility, the people sitting in the administration perform their duty and if we make a constructive contribution in the spirit of patriotism, in the spirit of patriotism, in the spirit of patriotism, in the spirit of patriotism, then our country will be able to scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the sportspersons who had gone to the Paralympics have created history and their view is a victory of human emotions.
Narendra Modi has also written to Shri Varun Vishwanath on the app that our players have done a great job and you should mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only these two, every individual of the country has got an emotional bond with our players of the Paralympics.
Perhaps by moving ahead from sports, by looking at the Paralympics and our sportspersons, the vision of humanity has completely changed our vision towards the Divyangs.
There is immense strength in this sentence.
This time, 1 players, including 3 women from our country, participated in the paralysis.
In comparison to other sportspersons, when they play Divyangs, physical capabilities, sports skills are even greater.
He won the Golden uadrilateral in Bhalafang, Bhai Devendra Jhazaria and won it again after 12 years.
Age increases in the age of 12 years and after winning the Golden uadrilateral, the spirit also decreases slightly.
However, Devendra showed that the condition of the body, or the rise of age, could not weaken his resolve and he brought the Golden Moon again after 12 years.
And he was not a Divyang from birth.
He had to lose one of his hands due to electric shock.
Just imagine, the people who attained the first Golden uadrilateral at the age of 23 and at the age of 35, would have made such a big difference in their lives.
The High Jump won the Golden uadrak.
And Thangavelu lost his left foot at the age of 5.
Poverty did not come in the way of their involvement.
He neither lives in a big city nor comes from a middle class Amir family.
Despite passing through a difficult situation at the age of 21, he also gave a solemn philosophy to the country in the midst of physical difficulties.
With the name of Deepa Malik of sportspersons, the pride of fluttering many victories has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati obtained a bronze medal in the high altitude.
It is not only the greatness of these moonlights of the Paralympics but in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, these monks have done a great job to look at the divine brothers and sisters.
Our feelings have not only changed but our perspective of looking at these disabled persons has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of how these Divyangjans had performed in this time paralysis.
A few days ago, the Olympics contested the same place.
This time it has been created.
In the race of 1500 metres, the Olympics competing in which the Golden uadrilateral was generated, Abdelletif Baka of Algeria broke the record for 1500 metres in the 1500 metre competition for the Divyangjans in a short span of time.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that the fourth person among the Divyangjans who did not get any medal as a race competition but they also ran in less time than winning the gold medal in the competition of ordinary runners.
Once again I congratulate all our players and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth scheme for the Paralympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I experienced many wonders in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was an emotional moment for me.
A mega camp of the Government of India was organised for the Divyangjans and it was established in the world today.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book and in that book some successful stories of Divyangjans have been collected.
There were very inspiring events.
I consider it important to have a world record on the soil of India and Navsari.
It was successfully used to place machines in the ears to listen to those who could not hear it within eight hours.
It was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to establish a three-dimensional world by the Divyang people in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on October 2, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become our nature, it should be the duty of every citizen.
Now, on the second October, when it is taking two years, I can assert with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of millions and millions of Indians.
Today, we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved ahead by 1. 25 billion steps towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is correct.
Its fruits are so good and we have also seen what is happening with some such effort.
Bus stations, railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, everybody, children to the elderly, the village, the poor, the farmers, the women, all of them have been contributing to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For health, for the dignity of the citizens, especially for the honour of the mothers and sisters, the open defecation should be stopped.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be able to achieve complete success in the near future in terms of liberation from open defecation.
Recently, when I had gone to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will fully achieve the goal of ODF.
I would especially like to present a scheme for young friends who are using technology today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation in your city of cleanliness drive and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
You will not only be able to know the condition of building toilets in your city but you will also be able to apply for toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has been launched to know about the sanitation related grievances and the situation of solving the grievances.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
This Swachhta Abhiyan will not be a matter of concern even if it is confined to Sanskrit.
Cleanliness is not enough to become a nature.
It should be used for making waste fertilizers and it has also been started by the government during the policy time.
fertilizer companies have been asked to purchase the compost-centrial fertilizer that they produce from the waste.
And this ensures the farmers who want to go to livelihood.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the sanitation of the earth, they want to stop the losses due to chemical fertilizers.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this regard as a brand ambassador.
I also invite the youth to start new start-ups from waste to waste to waste to waste, to develop such instruments, to develop such technology, to manufacture them in affordable manner.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, a special programme - Indo-Bharat Swachhata Parishad is also being organized.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, mayors and commissioners from all over the country, all of them together have to concentrate only on cleanliness.
What can be done in technology 
What could be the economic infrastructure 
How can a public participation be done 
How can the employment opportunities be increased in this 
All issues are going to be discussed.
And I see that there is a lot of new knowledge about cleanliness.
Just a day ago, I read in a newspaper that students from Gujarat Technological University went to 10 villages and started an awareness campaign to build toilets.
He worked for himself and contributed to constructing nearly a thousand toilets.
Just a few days ago, you must have seen that a team under the leadership of Vingakmandar Param Vir Singh swimming around 2800 kilometers from Devprayag to Gangasagar and spread the message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a full year calendar timing paper in their respective departments.
Each department will focus on 15 days specially on cleanliness.
In the coming October, the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Panchayati Raj Department and Department of Rural Development will work together to increase sanitation in their respective areas from 1st to 15th October.
The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, Department of Food Processing Industries, Department of Food Processing Industries, will undertake the Safai Campaign for 15 days from October 16 to October 31, last two weeks.
You must have seen that all the cleanliness drives are underway today.
Earlier, three cities were reported to the people of the country about the status of cleanliness.
Now there are more than 500 cities in the country with more than one lakh population and due to this there is a belief in every city that we are lagging behind but we will do something better tomorrow.
A competitive environment of cleanliness has been created.
I hope that all the citizens of our country can contribute to this movement as much as possible.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has also been completed for two years.
I urge you to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge everyone in every family to have a choice so that the poor household can have a Diwali lamp.
On the second of October, when it is Sunday, how can we connect ourselves with the work of cleanliness as a citizen
If you have a video then send a video.
If our efforts across the country will once again give a new boost to this movement, new momentum will be achieved.
Remembering the blessings of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, when I asked for gas subsidy and the response given by my countrymen is a very inspiring event in India's national life.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the shells and the old sports they used to ask for donations from their families and the sports they used to give bets to the poorest of the poor.
The wonderful pleasure that he used to see poor children watching pilgrim sports was such a thing that it happened to him.
The work of describing the political ideology of millions of workers like me, the political ideology of India, the political party related to the origins of India, the thinking of rewarding the cultural heritage of India, who gave a political philosophy, gave a solemn philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy of philosophy is beginning today.
The principle of Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the people of Awada.
How can a poor man get the fruits of development
He gave all his hands work, water to every farm, a complete economic agenda in two words.
The country can only liberate the country from poverty if it focuses on its birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, on the benefits of development of the society, on the benefits of development.
As part of this, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya has been named Lok Kalyan Marg on the birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who is now known as the Rescue Road of the British.
It is a symbol of this centenary year's poor welfare year.
My dear countrymen, I had started the Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashami.
I have been making an honest effort in this regard that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to commemorate those government works.
How is the individual of this country inspiring me
Is it the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way Mann Ki Baat appreciated and improved the way Mann Ki Baat was being completed this week.
I am also grateful to the people of Akashwani who have not only spread these things to me, but have made every effort to reach them in all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave a glimpse of the government's shortcomings, and Akashwani made a special programme on these letters, called the representatives of the government and provided a platform for the solution of the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue but it has become a new opportunity for social change.
For anyone what other reason of this big satisfaction can be any other reason .
My dear countrymen, on the coming weeks, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, in a way a different kind of atmosphere is present throughout the country.
It is a festival of unbelievable practices, the unity of society is the ability of the country.
Then whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can it be a festival of prayers for the unity of the society
How to become a festival connecting humans 
And only then can we celebrate the festival of victory by mixing it with the means of realisation.
Let us take the mantra of unity and let us follow the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of Dhyanchandji, Hockey's architect on 2nd August.
This day is celebrated as the National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and also remind you of his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in making India a golden hub of hockey in the 128th, 132nd, 136th Olympic Games.
We all know the name of cricketism, breadmen.
He said for Dhyanchand ji, Hee Schores is a living example of Goal Like Rance, Dhyanchand ji Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once, during the match in the Coal, an opposition team player shot a hockey on Dhyanchandji's head.
There was only 10 minutes left to complete the match at that time.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three goals in those ten minutes and said, I have taken revenge for the injuries.
But I noticed that this time, I was urging everyone to talk about the Rio Olympics.
I see it positive that the ordinary citizen should have so much appreciation for the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the head of the country or say something about it.
Besides cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, there is so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Reading this message for me also became a source of great inspiration in itself.
Please tell the girls about their participation in education and sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in the Rio Olympics.
Any Sriman Sachin writes, You must mention Sindhu, Witness and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
The medals that we received were provided by these daughters.
Our daughters once again proved that they do not get off from anyone in any way.
One of these daughters is from north India and one from south India and another from east India.
Someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the entire India have taken a very big step to make the country proud.
On May Gov, Summit Thakur has written that we could perform better in the Olympics.
He has written, Excellency Modi sir, congratulations for the first time we have won two medals in Rio, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our exhibition was really good
And the answer is - no.
We need to make a lot of difference in sports.
Our parents are still asking us to focus on education.
Even today, sports is considered to be a boom of time in society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs inspiration.
Thus thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny that we cannot demonstrate our hopes unprecedented.
It also happened that the exhibition that our athletes used to perform in India, the sportspersons who used to watch were not able to reach there.
And only two medals could be found in the quest for the medal.
But it is also true that even if we do not get a medal, for the first time in many sports, Indian sportspersons have shown great skills.
But why can we forget that it is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympic Finals
Something similar happened in tennis with the combination of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babare made a polyphone for the Track Fild Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, women hockey teams have reached the Olympics.
India's sportspersons will certainly be good for us.
As many sportspersons, Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we do what we have done then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
We will make a map of how we can do better.
Just imagine, the prince chooses one or two of his games and plans how he can perform excellently in it.
I also urge the associations associated with sportspersons to be mindless.
And I appeal to every citizen of India that whatever is interested in it, let me send a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App.
Write to the government.
Association will discuss and give its representation to the Government.
State Governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
But we should prepare ourselves completely and I am confident that 65 per cent of our countrymen, 65 per cent of them are youngsters, they have to move ahead with a solemn pledge to achieve a better position in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for many years.
But for this time, I had to go to the G-20 Summit so that I could express my emotions in the matter of mind today.
We have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life to his disciples, to his students.
Nowadays after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson but he has given a brilliant example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichandji for his penance, dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teachers' contribution is always felt in our lives.
On September 5, former President of India Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji is the birth anniversary and the country considers it as a teacher day.
He may have reached that place in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say: "Good teachers are those whose students never die.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived such a wonderful life to keep the student alive as a teacher and as a teacher in mind despite being the President's office.
I think I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
However, today I can say with joy that even if one of my teachers is now 70 years old then even today their letter comes to me every month.
And that is why if I see any good letters then there is a lot of respect in my heart.
It is the responsibility of all of us to make our teachers proud in society.
If you have photographs with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if there is any motivation for your teachers then definitely present them.
Look, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganeshotsav will be celebrated in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a scholar and we all want that the lives of our country, our society, our family, every individual remain intact.
But when we talk about the Ganesh festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now, not just Maharashtra but in every corner of India public Ganesh festivals are being celebrated.
Discipline competitions, colourful competitions.
Even in their exhibitions, there is a lot of artistic zeal in touching the issue of society.
This big campaign of public education runs through the Ganesh Utsav.
Surajya is our birth right, let us move to the state now, let us become our priority. Can we not convey this mantra through a public Ganesh Utsav
Come, let me invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are possible for the society.
This time, many people have also sent me a lot of writing on the Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
Why do not use the idol of Ganeshji made of mud of the village pond 
The POP-made idols are not relevant to the environment.
It is also the service of God that protects the environment, protects our rivers and basins and protects the small creatures of these waters.
Ganesh ji is a scholar.
We should not create such a Ganeshji that produces widows.
I don't know how you will take these things, but I don't just say this thing, many people say this thing and I have heard many things - there is a sculptor Shriman Abhijit Ghondfal.
Environmental Ganesh Festival - this is also a social service.
There is still time for Durga Puja.
Today, let us decide the old family that makes statues.
If I buy a statue from them, they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the soil of the pond or river then they will be able to go back to it.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the Ganesh Festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred with the Sant Upadhi on 4th September.
Mother Teresa dedicated her whole life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who has served the poor of India throughout her life, has attained the title of Saints.
On September 4, the Government of India will also send an official delegation to lead our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
We have to learn something from the saints, from the sages, from the great men every moment.
Let us keep getting something, keep learning and keep doing something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big a change comes.
Janash Kat is considered to be the form of God.
Government of India has made a successful effort to connect people with the help of five state governments, for clean Ganga, for clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, Sarpanches of the village on the banks of the Ganges were invited to Allahabad.
No one came from Uttarakhand for this solemn pledge.
Someone came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar, somebody came from Jharkhand, somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding peoples power.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me very much and those who are imagining them also have special respect in my heart.
On 15th July, more than seventy-two school students from Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote to their parents.
Children from seven to seventy years of age have done this thing.
Congratulations to all those students who made this effort and special felicitations to the parents who decided to make their children's letter seriously.
There are things that inspire us.
In the Koppal district of Karnataka, a sixteen year old daughter Mallamma respected Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
It has become the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
However, every person is connected to it in some way, everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There is an idea in the Government of India and people have requested that you make a film of two minutes, three minutes on cleanliness and send this short film to the Government of India.
You will get details on the website.
It will compete and be rewarded for the victory that will take place on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
I also tell the channels that you should also compete for such films.
Creative creativity can also give a boost to the cleanliness drive.
New methods will be known, new inspiration will be given and all this will be done by the common artists with the participation of the people.
It is not necessary that there should be a big studio, a good model to make the film.
A very important thing has happened in the past.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Friendship Channel - will some people now have to inaugurate a radio channel
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, he will share the Akashwani Friendship and Bangladesh Betar on the other hand, and Bangladeshi people on both sides will enjoy the astronomy.
I also express my gratitude to Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even if you have given me the task of advancing, I feel like you too.
And sometimes even more emotional events touch me.
Such emotional events also give new energy and new inspiration, which inspires people to do something or the other.
In the past, I received a letter that touched my heart.
Around 84 year old mother who is a retired teacher wrote this letter to me.
If he had never allowed me to declare his name in this letter, I would have spoken to him today.
In a letter, he wrote that when you requested to release gas subsidy, I had abandoned the subsidy and then I had forgotten it.
My dear countrymen, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should send it to Ruburu.
My effort is to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, the campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of chicken pox is excellent, I am an retired teacher.
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but of the feelings of the mother and it is the blessings of the mothers and sisters that gives strength and confidence for the future of my country.
I bow down to that mother and also bow down to those daughters of India who have always been suffering and do something.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought but this month of August was constantly full of floods.
Some parts of the country were flooded.
The state governments, the local Self-Government bodies, the social institutions and the citizens could do as much.
However, among these flood news, there were reports that needed to be more reminded.
What is the strength of unity, if we move together then we will be remembering the month of August this year for how big results can be achieved.
In August 2016, many opposition parties, non-subsisting parties and nearly 70 parties from all over the country, and several parties from all over the country, all these political parties together passed the GST Bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, in the context of the situation of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country had spoken of Kashmir in one voice.
If we talk about this thing in the least words then I will say that unity and maternity - these two things are in the basic mantra. And all of us believe that it is from the Sarpanch of the village to the elderly people that if anyone dies in Kashmir then whether it is a young man or a security worker, it is ours, it is our people, it is our country, those people who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by taking these children forward, at times they will have to answer the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a society, all of us are responsible for building a nation full of diversity in the bonds of unity, so that we bring out more emphasis on unity, then only the country can create a bright future.
My dear brothers and sisters, I believe in the accomplishment of crores of Indians.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, greetings.
This morning I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the days to come, the color of sports throughout the country will enhance the youth with enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be held.
The word Rio will repeat in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the exhibition of its sportspersons.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but those who have gone to play in Rio, it is the work of 1. 25 billion Indians to increase the zeal of players.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a detailed event Run for Rio, Khelo Aur Jio and Khelo Aur Khelo Khelo Khelo.
What should we do for the promotion of our sportspersons, wherever we may be in the coming days
No matter how much the food habits are, we have to leave everything.
Even if there is a sweet smell in the winter, one has to leave the bed and flee to the ground and not only to the player but also to his parents.
Sportspersons are not made overnight.
I am also ready to do this thing on behalf of you.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to become a postman to deliver your message to these players.
Let us enhance the pride of each and every sportsperson in the coming days.
And today when I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem has been sent by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of a poet-loving Punjab Central University.
Maybe there will be many other poets who have sent poems, maybe they will write poems, but some will also give them voice.
Everyday technology keeps changing, everyday takes a new form, everyday there are new impressions, it keeps changing.
You cannot capture technology.
If research and innovation does not happen then the way coastal water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a bogey.
And if we live without research and innovation with the confidence of old technology then we will have to get out of the changing age in the world and therefore we will have to give a boost to the spirit of science, research and innovation in the new generation.
The Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One goal is to create an eco-system across the country through this Atal Innovation Mission, an innovation, experimentation, enterprise, and enhance the potential of new employment.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre (Incubation Centre) has a direct link with innovation.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has decided to provide a huge amount of Rs.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We face problems in our daily lives.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And the Atal Grand Challenge has called upon the youth of the country to find solutions to the problems faced by you people through technology, research, innovation and solutions.
Government of India seeks to give a special prize to the technology discovered for solving our problems.
And I am glad that people are interested in talking about the fact that when we talked about the tinkering lab, about thirty thousand schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions of educational and non-educational institutions came forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that the right tribute to Abdul Kalam ji - research, innovation, technology to solve the problems of our daily lives, simplification of our problems will be done by our new generation.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worried about the drought and today rain is also being enjoyed and flood news is also coming up.
The State Government and the Central Government have been making a lot of efforts to help the flood victims in collaboration.
Due to the rains, the hearts and minds of all of us get overwhelmed because the focal point of our entire economic activity lies in the rains.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us relieved forever.
But if we remain aware, alert and striving hard then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
Dengue was brought to the fore.
Dengue can be avoided.
Keeping in mind a little bit of hygiene, keep some vigilance and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and the poorest of the poor is a disease but there is no case of dengue.
Dengue comes first in happy areas and therefore let us understand it.
You would have noticed the publication on TV, but sometimes we are conscious of being aware of it and taking care of it.
The government, hospitals and doctors will not only do their job but we will also be cautious about our homes, our regions, our families and the diseases caused by water.
On one more issue, my dear countrymen, I would like to concentrate on you.
Life has become so busy that sometimes we dont have time to think for us.
If we fall sick then we feel that we will be able to recover quickly and we will be able to take any antibiotics in our body.
But the bacteria that are present in them are used to these medicines and then the medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria. Then they leave for years in fighting against these bacteria, making new medicines, doing scientific research etc.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing such a change within themselves that there is no effect on the medicines.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance and hence it is important to follow the rules of using antibiotics .
When it comes to health, I would like to add one more thing.
Though the maternal mortality rate has come down in the last one decade, but even today a large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy or during pregnancy , infection related to birth , high BP , no matter what kind of problem it is when its life is destroyed .
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has started a new drive over the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, on the 9th of every month all pregnant women will be screened free of cost at Government Health Centres.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give 12 days in a year for the poor
I have written a lot of letters in the past.
Thousands of doctors have come forward after accepting my words.
However, India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I am sure you will add.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is very concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
India has been emphasizing on these things for centuries.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Shri Krishna talks about the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Shri Krishna says, I blossom in all the trees.
The Surakshacharya Policy says: Nasti Maula Anushadhan there is no plant that has no medicinal properties.
Mahabharata's Discipline Festival - has discussed it in a very wide range and it has been said that it is a tree for the trees that flow.
There is no doubt about it.
The tree that donates is like a tree in the world as well.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came to my mind.
In the discipline festival of Mahabharata, it is said that trees also fulfil the responsibilities of children across the world, so that they can not only fulfill their parents but also realize the desires of the society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring way in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra.
When I saw their pictures in social media, I was surprised to see that there were no creatures in the wedding but the plants were visible all around.
The sight of the picture was heartening.
In a way, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal story of nature's love and I wish Sonal and Mr. Mahatrejee all the best for this innovative endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pilgrims visiting the Ambaji Temple.
And I would like to tell them that this is the mother's prasad and if you worry about making this plant big by visiting your village then mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pilgrims used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed that year.
Temples can also start the tradition of planting in this season instead of prasad.
It can be a simple peoples movement - tree plantation.
Why don't we make the land waste by making the fences on the banks of our farms so why don't we make timber cultivation instead of wood
If we plant such trees along our farms that are used for furniture and housing then it can be sold after fifteen-twenty years with the permission of the government.
And it can also be a new tool for your income and India can also be avoided by importing a timber.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan - Marubhoomi - this is the biggest festival and we have resolved to set up twenty five lakh plants.
There is no small thing about twenty five lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan know how big it has taken.
He will also pledge to increase his green cover by 50.
The central government has launched the Green India Mission, under which the railways have speeded up this work.
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the festival of Van Vishnu.
This year, in Gujarat, Amravan, Ekta Forest, Martyr Forest have taken up many such projects in the form of Van Mahotsav and have started a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they also deserve to be congratulated.
But for me the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we recall South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When this word of non-violence, love and forgiveness falls in the world then the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela are swimming.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Settlement, which is known as Mahatma Gandhian residence Sarvadaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel by the train which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that led a Mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi, that Peter Meritsburg Station.
But I have got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who have laid down their lives for equality and equal opportunity and fought with Nelson Mandela.
Twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty years had spent his life with Nelson Mandela in jail.
In a way, the entire young woman had cautioned me and I was fortunate to see the dignitaries of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Tathada, Mr. Lalu Cheeba, Mr. George Baijori and Ronnie Casarils.
The manner in which the symptoms of the rituals are described in the songs are very evident.
My heart will be reminded of that visit.
There cannot be a mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any society and government.
The priorities will be different, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equality of opportunity, equality of equality, feeling of humor.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have lived up to the basic mantras of our lives in South Africa too.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who have given me the message and their concerns are very natural.
As a woman, I feel sorry for that family.
And some people get frustrated and get caught in the money laundering.
A new method of looting through this technology is spreading around the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments they came to know that everything was looted.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
Artificial paintings are drawn at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then you must go to the station.
Today, I have been receiving such reports from several railway stations in India, local people are presenting their identities on the walls of railway stations through their art.
There is an innovation.
This is an example of how public participation can take place.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country and specially congratulate my friends of Aligarh.
And you will also be joining the festival at home and outside.
We have special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, can you not give the mothers and sisters of your country the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Rakshabandhan
Just imagine, give such gifts to sisters that will protect them in their lives.
And today is social security.
Today, Raksha Bandhan has a true meaning.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in an independent India.
Let the entire nation be colored in the colour of freedom fighters, let us once again feel the fragrance of freedom, let us create this atmosphere and let the Freedom Festival be a programme of our countrymen, not a government programme.
We should have our own festivals like Diwali.
I hope that you too will do something related to patriotism.
Those who want you to keep your words from the Red Fort so brilliantly.
And nowadays technology platform is so simple that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes many programmes during the holidays.
And that is why one also feels like enjoying a man.
And there is a feeling that if you get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it will be better.
But the terrible heat of this time has spoiled all the fun around.
However, I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts.
Awareness is seen in many villages and what is the value of water is known to those who have suffered from water problems.
And that is why there is a sensitivity about water and there is activity in doing something.
A few days ago, somebody told me that Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Ehmednagar district of Maharashtra have solved the water as a very sensitive question of the village.
The crops that used the maximum amount of water, then they decided to leave the crops of sugarcane or coal.
It sounds very easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
And everybody went to the farming of horticulture and vegetables that required minimum water.
They have taken so many initiatives such as fountains, drip irrigation, rain water conservation, water conservation and today the village has got its own strength to tackle the water crisis.
Yes, I would like to talk about Bajar village on a small hill but there would be so many such villages.
I also thank all such villagers for their excellent work.
Someone told me that there is a Gorava Gram Panchayat in the district of Das in Madhya Pradesh.
This Panchayat has made efforts to create sports sports pools.
Although water has been saved, but when water falls on the surface, the quality of water also improves significantly.
Sometimes it seems that when the Indian government brought water to Latur by train, it became a news for the world.
It is true that the speed at which the railways have done this thing deserves congratulations, but the people of Pela village also deserve similar congratulations.
I will say that more than railways deserve congratulations.
However, many such schemes which are being implemented by the citizens are not neglected at all.
The nature of the person, however, sometimes some problems may be passed through the middle of the day, but some good news comes about it, it seems as if the entire problem has been resolved.
This year, the possibility of rains falling from 106 to 110 percent has come to light, as if a message of great peace has come up.
It is time for rains to come but news of good rains also brought a new consciousness.
It gives us the same opportunity and challenge as it gives us the same pleasure as it gives us a good rainfall.
Can we run a campaign from now on to save the village water
Farmers need soil and they are used to grow crops in the fields.
This time why do not we take soil out of the ponds of the village and take it to the fields 
This will also improve the land of the farm and increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Whether water can be stopped in any cement bag, in empty bags of some fertilizer, by filling clay and soil
If water stops for five days, if water stops for seven days then water will go down to the ground and water level will rise in the ground.
Our wells will get water.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
We may have water crisis, drought conditions, but we have time for the next one and a half months.
And I have always said that when we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, we should see a place in the different places where we want to see what kind of buses have been constructed under the house to save rain water and how the water remains pure.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come up, several schemes have been formulated, several restrictions have been spent so it is very natural for millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to come up with this question in their hearts.
Ganga is a Mokshadayani for those who have religious beliefs.
I will not only accept this greatness, but I feel that the Ganga is a life-style.
Ganga provides us a new strength to live with it.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
In a way, we brought the Ganga but to save crores of devotees are required.
This cannot be successful without public participation.
And that is why all of us have to become a representative of change for cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
The states that have been formed along the banks of the Ganges are also trying to take full support of the states.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent supplementary and industrial pollution.
Everyday, solid waste is being poured into the Ganges in large quantities along with drainage.
In order to clean such waste, the Trash Skimmer at Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. works to clean waste immediately in water.
These machines have been provided to all local voluntary organisations and have been requested to run them continuously and clean garbage from there.
And in the last few days, I have been told that there is a very good effort and at the same time garbage is being taken out from 3 to 11 tonnes per day.
Pulp and paper industry which is nearly completely shut down due to waste or black licker exit.
All this indicates that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he certainly says that the Ganga will be clean.
And that is why the people who have faith in it will certainly succeed in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This system is being run in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is considered as Panchayatiraj Diwas in India.
Today, Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, the Panchayati Raj system across the country has been successfully working as an important unit of our democratic system.
And that is why the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, has launched the Bharat Yojana from 14th April to 24th April, 10th April.
And today, on 24th day, I will celebrate the Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand where our most tribal brothers and sisters live.
And once again on the occasion of Panchayati Raj Day, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness.
How can democratic institutions be strengthened at the level of villages in every corner of India
How to make the villages self-reliant 
How do the villages plan their own development 
Girl's birthday should be a festival of village.
There are several such schemes.
In some villages, food donation programmes were organized.
Perhaps in all these villages of India, such programmes may have been going on for ten days at a very short time.
I congratulate all the State Governments and Sarpanches of the villages for this.
In a very original way, with innovation, this entire movement was transformed into an opportunity for the development of the village, for the strengthening of the democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India's rise.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question to you about education in school colleges.
Over the years, there has been a need for reforms in the education sector.
For example, lack of adequate schools or colleges or quality in education.
Today, if there is any first dream of parents in every family then it is for the good education of children.
Homes, cars, everybody gets the idea.
And for a country like India, this feeling of the peoples mind is very powerful.
Children should be educated and educated better and should be more aware.
And the children also become aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would urge all the girls and parents to talk to them in detail about the activities being done in the school.
And if anything is noticed then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This opportunity can also reduce many evils from our education system.
In a way, an attempt to spread education all around was a priority.
And that was also necessary.
However, the greater the importance of expanding now is the improvement in our education.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
The literacy campaign will now have to make good education our priority.
Entry, entrance, mantra continues to sink, but now we have to focus on good education, proper education and those children who have reached school.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
But it is true that we need to bring about reforms from humidity.
This time you must have seen in the budget that the work has been done by chewing the chilo.
In the budget, he has asked ten public universities and ten private universities to come out of government obstacles and come on the path of challenge. Let us tell you what you want to do to become the highest university.
This scheme has been formulated with the aim of giving them complete freedom.
Universities of India can also become globally competitive universities.
Along with this, the importance of education is equally important.
Similarly, technology will also play a very big role in education.
Remote distance education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I believe that the results will be visible in the near future.
For a long time people keep asking me on one subject.
Some people write on a web portal, MyGov.
Some people write to me on Narendra Modi App, and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, sports has a great significance for the youth as well as for the practice.
So one day I also got the opportunity to interact with you people, before that I will interact with all the seven.
The result was that I had just called a meeting in which NCC was headed, head of the NSS, head of the Scouts Guides, Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra.
And when I asked him who had met earlier, he said, "No brother, our country has got such a first meeting after independence.
And I believe that a new life of these organisations should be fulfilled, a new strength should be imbibed.
This time I have put some topics in front of them.
Brothers and sisters, why don't our youth, all the organizations do a great job of water conservation in this season
Which programmes can we create to connect the country
What could be the common youth of all our organizations
What can we add new things to their work culture and programmes
If you write on my Narendra Modi app, I will send it to the right place.
Such a situation will become a reality.
My dear countrymen, today I convey my best wishes to all of you to force us to think.
I also look at it as a messing up of the people.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that in the last few elections, there were discussions about how many cylinders will be given to the party.
And every political party used to think that if it comes to the middle class society from the point of view of elections then there is a big issue of gas battalion.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing them to reduce the subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were set up which had very big proposals and suggestions to reduce gas subsidy.
Crores of rupees were spent on these committees.
However, the matter used to remain there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But there was a lot of thinking outside it.
My countrymen, I am glad to mention all of you today that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy.
However, after calculating it, it was found that there were more than 80 percent of these 1 crore families, who got themselves distributed there, were in queues and got their subsidy by writing.
One incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if the world's economists do so, they will do so, they will consequences, thus making economic equations.
For them, this is an incident outside of their thoughts and somebody has to think about it.
I specially urge the entire political fraternity to say that we need to rely on the people everywhere.
You must not have thought that we will get such a result.
And we should go in this direction.
Please rely on those who are sending Marcus through their examination.
Sometimes I feel that we should make a declaration that there will not be any ticket checker in the railway payrolls today.
Every newspaper and News Channel contains every breaking news.
Isn't there any good in our surroundings in a country with a population of Rs.
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that before printing, only positive news will be printed on him.
He used to talk about it continuously.
A few days ago, he had written a letter to me and said that we have decided that we will not give any negative news on Monday.
Good news becomes one of the biggest reasons for inspiring good news.
However, it is true that the more we strengthen goodness, the less the place for the evildoers will be.
If I light the lamp, the darkness will disappear.
You can also contribute to it.
I have suggested good advice to you people but please do not be angry with me.
Let us all strive together to make a positive difference, let us strive to speak positively.
The speciality of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Convention can also be a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people around the world will be aware that crores of people will come to the bank of the river for such a long time.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the State Tourism Department to compete with it.
Photo Competition, and tell people to upload beautiful pictures in beauty.
How will the atmosphere be created at a rapid pace and people will also be aware of the diversity of the Kumbh Congregation.
So it can be done.
Yes, it is true that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh had met me and he used to say that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that there should be cleanliness.
From there people also take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh may be a religious-spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should also use this Kumbh Mela in providing a message of water conservation, how to increase the love for water and how to increase the faith towards water.
My dear countrymen, on this important day of Panchayati Raj, I will meet you once again in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You might remember that last time I had talked about a book on Premchandji's stories and we had decided that I would share a few things with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I see that a large number of people have shared the information about several types of books.
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
I am right, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to accept one thing that now I cannot spend too much time reading books.
However, one advantage is that I am getting the opportunity to know about many books when you people are writing it.
But from the experience of last month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why should we create a permanent Books Corner on the NarendraModiApp And whenever we read new books, write about it and discuss it.
And you can also mention a good name for our Books Corner.
I want this Books corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Keep reading, writing and sharing it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several influential efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have been told about traditional methods and methods.
Midia too has a lot of innovations on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, everything is doing something at the battlefield.
Looking at the strength of the community, it feels very good and satisfying.
For example, the enthusiasm shown by the villagers in Jharkhand about water management has become an example for everyone at a distance from Ranchi, in the Ara Karam village of Ormenzi block.
You will also be happy to know that Ishaan, the beautiful state of India, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, crop farming is encouraged which requires less water and there is no harm to the farmers.
I specially congratulate the Haryana Government for interacting with the farmers and inspired them to strain from conventional farming and produce less water.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Many fairs are also organized on the occasion of festivals.
Why should we not use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life thrive in us and especially the achievements of the children, their achievements, they give us new energy. And that is why today I feel like talking about some children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Manish Joshi, Danshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Naga, Atharva Deshmukh, Arunitesh Ganguly and Hrithik Alamanda.
What I will say about them will also fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that frightens the whole world.
It seems that death stands at the entrance, but all these ten children have not only defeated dangerous diseases like cancer in their lives, but have also brought the name of India to the world through their valour.
In fact, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports event in which the Young Cancer Survivors participate in the same way as those who have emerged from cancer.
Competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organized in the competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I firmly believe that you must have been proud of the success of India across the sky, in space, in the success of India - I speak of Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjiv Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Aravindra Rao, several such people from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and he has urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
Indeed, 2017 has been very good for India in terms of space.
Our scientists left A-SAT in March, followed by Chandrayaan-2.
There could not be much discussion about the major and important news like A-SAT during the polls.
We have achieved the capability of breaking the satellite in just three minutes, three hundred kilometers away from the A-SAT missile.
India became the fourth country to achieve this achievement and now on 22nd July, the entire nation saw with pride that Chandrayaan-2 had taken its stroke from Sriharikota towards space.
But if you ask me what two major teachings I have received from Chandrayaan 2 then I will say that these two teachings are Faith and Fearlessness i. e.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, we must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely incorporated in Indian colour.
It is Indian in terms of objective and spirit.
This is a fully indigenous mission.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists launched Chandrayaan-Be in the revolutionary times, day-night, by tackling all the technological problems.
The entire world saw this great penance of scientists.
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always keep in mind that we have the potential to overcome them.
I sincerely hope that the Chandrayaan 2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In fact, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly waiting for the month of September when there will be lander Vikram and Rover-Intelligence on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share a very interesting competition with the student friends and young friends of the country and invite the youngsters of the country for a quiz competition.
Space experts, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the main subjects of this uiz Competition, such as what to do for rocket launches.
How the satellite is installed in the room and what kind of information we get from the satellite, what kind of A-SAT happens, there are so many things.
I appeal to young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, attractive and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge schools, girls, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
The most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the students who get the highest qualifications from each state to Sriharikota at their own expense and in September they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan is landing on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event in their lives for these victorious students.
But for that you will have to participate in the quiz competition, get the maximum marks, you will have to win.
Friends, You must have missed my suggestion - this is a fun opportunity.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our thoughts have given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
Beginning five years ago, this journey is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness but the way Swachhta Abhiyan has succeeded from ODF to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days back, I was talking about Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
He has not only cleaned Delhi a few days back but has also taken the lead in making it beautiful.
He started with his team from Lodhi Garden garbage collectors.
Through the Street Art, he worked to decorate many areas of Delhi with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of over bridges and schools to the slums, when they started to carve out their duties then people got their support and this sequence started.
You might remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
I came to know that Bhai Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in this.
There may be no sound in the colors and lines, but the message of the Indradhanush that is produced by it is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience it in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of waste to health in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making garbage waste.
My dear countrymen, I have read a very interesting stamp on MyGov in the past.
It was the brother of Mohammad Aslam who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote - Mann Ki Baat is keen to hear the programme.
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June.
I feel that such programmes should be organized every three months.
Besides, online monitoring of the programme should also be arranged.
In my view, it was such an initiative in which people had a direct interaction with the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent me the message and after reading it, my anxiety to know about the Back to Village programme increased and when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also know about it.
The people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are.
This programme goes on for weeks and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state, government officials briefed the people of the village about the expansion of government schemes and programmes.
How to strengthen the Panchayats
How to increase their income
What can be the impact of their services in the lives of the common man The people of the village also expressed their concerns without any hesitation.
Friends, It was not only mentioned in this program that the officers would return to the village all day long but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things have also been included in this programme to make it interesting.
Sports Competition for children was organized under Khelo India.
Further, Sports Kit, MGNREGA Job Card and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became a part of this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was also organized in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day or one and a half days while passing through difficult roads.
These officers also reached the border panchayats, who are always in the athletes of cross-border gunmen, not only did the officers reach the extremely sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag.
Some officers were so impressed with their welcome that they had stayed in the villages for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance and it also proves that the power of development always falls heavily on the strength of the bomb.
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, they want to create obstacles, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, who has been honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented something like this in one of his poems in the month of Shravan.
In this poem, he has said - "The meaning of rainy vapours and the stream of water is unique and the earth is enchanted by its beauty.
Throughout India, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
In this season, whenever we look around us, it seems as if the earth has covered a green bed.
During this period, Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that during the last four years, the highest number of devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra.
Since 1st July, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of pilgrims who participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time only 28 days have been added.
I especially commend the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey become admirers of the emotions and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months since the start of the Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time since the devastating disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those parts of the country whose beauty blossoms a lot during the monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel may not be a bigger teacher than this.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and lively month of Shravan will communicate with you new energy, new hopes and new hopes.
Similarly, it reminds us of the uit India Month.
However, when we look at TV, we see only one aspect of the rain - floods, frozen water, traffic jams.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your children's examination.
But if we change our way of examining the examination, perhaps we can be free from anxiety.
In my last Mann Ki Baat, I was told that I am delighted to share your experience and suggestions on Narendra Modi App.
Teachers who have been very successful have sent me a lot of words from parents and some thinkers of the society.
I will also talk about what I have read and what I have read.
How many of these things do I feel
I would like to tell you that India's youngsters are proud of the messages he has sent.
You must work hard, but set a real target for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
So it was very important for me to find a little bit for this.
So I thought that I would expect and fulfill my goals.
But I am fulfilling my mission and I am fulfilling it so I am doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speech and goals gradually gained momentum.
I would like to tell you that it is very important that your thoughts are positive.
Why is competition 
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why dont we compete with ourselves
Why should we not decide to break all our old records
You lice, no one can stop you moving forward.
And when you break your old records then there will be a satisfaction for you, for your satisfaction and for your satisfaction.
Friends, do not consider examination as a game of data.
Don't be stuck in the queues of what reaches.
Life should be linked with some great objective.
Dreams should be driven and resolved.
Whether these examinations are going to be true or not, our speed is correct or not.
And that is why if the dreams are huge, the examination will become a joyous festival.
Every examination will be a step towards accomplishing this great objective.
Every success will be the key to achieving this great objective.
And do not be confined to what will happen this year, what will happen in such a examination.
Walk with a very big objective and if there is anything less than expected in it then it will not be disappointed.
And it will be courageous to make efforts with greater strength.
Thousands of people have written to me on my App smaller than mobile phones.
Subhas Gupta has stressed that a healthy mind remains in the body.
Students, along with your studies, keep in mind your health so that you can write well in the examination.
Now, I dont have to say this thing on the last day that you should start a campaign and go for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how is your daily routine especially during the examination days
Our 365 days of consciousness should be integral to our dreams and resolves.
I agree with one thing from Shri Prabhukar Reddy Ji, he has specifically requested that he should sleep on time and revision should be done after waking up in the morning.
The entrance paper and other items at the examination centre should be reached before the schedule.
Prabhakar Reddi ji has said that I may not hesitate to say that because I am slightly sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends keep complaining to me that you are sleeping very little.
And this is possible.
I am not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even in one part of our body, even in one part of our body.
Not only this, our daily routine also gets distraught.
And that is why we don't consider any cheese as small.
You lice do not get stuck in the habit of compromising with what is definite.
Fix it, do it.
Friends, sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examinations have two types of students.
You must have seen these two kinds of students.
If anybody can do this better than me, who has a mastery in checking up and the big players of the world who have checked it.
Viswanathan Anand, Champion of Tawa Chase will share his experience.
Come, let us learn from them the way you check in this examination.
Hello, I am Viswanathan Anand, let me begin by conveying my best wishes on your exams.
I would like to talk about the examinations and their experiences.
It looks like problems in life after examinations.
When you play, you don't know what kind of study will be there, you don't even know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have taken enough sleep then you will get the right answer that will give you the brain in the afternoon.
So be calm.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself, don't keep too much expectations.
Look at it as a challenge - I remember the teachings that I have been teaching during the year, I can solve the problems.
In the last minute, the topics that you don't remember properly should be passed through important matters.
You can recall some of the details with the teachers or the students who will help you in the examination.
If you repeat the difficult questions then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write it in a better way in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, be very deep, do not be very confident, and do not be disappointed, initially there is fear but I have successfully crossed these examinations.
Therefore, have a lot of faith in themselves.
"Vishwanathan Anand has really spoken very importantly.
Sometimes we used to listen, the deficiency of Arjuna's life - whose bird was watching him.
Sorrow is going on, you cannot calm yourself if you are putting up dashed books in the last moments.
Let's laugh, let's laugh, let's talk to friends, let's see, the atmosphere of peace will be created only after getting it done.
You can imagine that you are awake in a pond and beautiful things are visible below the pond.
But suddenly if a stone starts flowing in some water and a fountain starts flowing in water then what can be seen from the beautiful things that were seen in the pond 
If water is calm then things are visible no matter how deep they are.
But if water is unhealthy then nothing can be seen below .
Then I feel that if I don't feel a bit light then I will feel better.
So I myself have developed my technology.
It can be my experience which will help you too.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my App: Let us feel comfortable with friends and family for at least half an hour every day, Ghapa Mai has said this very important thing because most of us, when we come through the examination, we sit down to calculate what is wrong.
We are stuck in it.
Guys, don't do this.
Just come out of it and spend half an hour.
It is really a matter of understanding of Rajat ji.
Ramcharitmanas, while describing it in the present context, is trying to bring this culture of the country and the world together.
Such venerable Muraribapu has also sent important stamps to the students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and hence there is a blend of diversity in his speeches.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy by adopting the situation.
Your exams will certainly be successful if you move ahead without any hesitation and joy. And even if you do not succeed, it will not be a failure and it will be a pride to succeed.
I am also grateful to the revered Pujasri Muraribapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, today I want to tell you another thing.
I see that people who have told me their experiences this time have certainly discussed Yoga.
Friends, let me clarify today that if you start doing yoga tomorrow morning, it will be wrong with you.
However, it is true that Yoga is a big key in the journey of development of space, be it in the student life or be it in the second half of life.
It is easy to chew.
Look, if you can do Agar.
I have great faith in it.
It's not like that, my friend.
However, if we read the suggestions then perhaps we have coppered up ourselves or yes, it is okay.
And I would urge you to go for five minutes but read the suggestions.
For the first time, it seemed that I didn't get it, but if I read the same thing again then I noticed that no question was asked in a different way, but this is the same thing that I don't want to understand the questions.
Rao, he has stressed on patience.
Very few words have given a very good message to all the students.
Let us listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
From Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
I speak Rava.
I understand that it is natural to have anxiety due to examination.
And these are competitive examinations.
Don't worry, you do good.
I say the same to my young friends.
Always remember that there is a lot of opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
Strength, devotion and penance should be in you.
With such a quality, you will be successful in every exam and other efforts.
Goodblase, what is the way to talk about a scientist
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
Whatever he has said - destiny, penance, this is the same thing - dedication, determination, diligence.
If you look at it, fear will also be there.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do a good job.
Now the interest in my app has given a message on the experience of exams from the right.
He said that his family is constantly trying to create a positive environment during the examination.
It is true that Sachin ji also spoke about positive approach, positive frame of mind.
We read in our syllabus about the Thomas Elva Edition, the discoverer of electric rounds.
Friends, how many years have it taken for him to do this thing How many times did he get disappointed due to his lack of money
But today this electricity bulb also illuminates our lives.
It is said that the possibilities of success are hidden even in failure.
Who does not know Shrinivas Ramanujan One of the calculations of modern times - Indian destiny, you must know.
His formal education did not include a number of subjects, he did not have any special teachings.
However, he contributed immensely to various sectors such as methymical analysis, number theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone.
The Harry Potter category is popular all over the world today, but it was not in the beginning.
They had to bear a lot of difficulties.
Rolling said that in the face of difficulties, he used to work with full energy which was really important for him.
Nowadays the examination is not only for the students but also for the entire thinking and for the entire school and for the teachers.
But the situation is not good if the students are alone without the support of the girl and the teacher.
Whether it is a teacher, a girl or a senior student, all of them together form a team and move forward in a planned manner with a uniform thinking, the examination becomes easier.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app: He has complained that parents should not put any pressure on them to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged only to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Create a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, be it your daughter or daughter, see how many confederations come.
You will also be able to see those conferences.
Friends, one thing is certain, especially I want to tell young friends that the lives of our people have changed much more than our older generations.
Every moment, new discovery, new technologies and sciences are reflected in a new color.
And we are not just convinced.
We also want to go beyond the scientific fate of science.
I am doing this because today is National Science Day.
The Vigyan Mahotsav of the country is observed as National Science Day on 28 February.
On 28th February, 128 S. C.
Rommon announced his search roman efficiency.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
Jigyasa belongs to the people of science.
And new discovery cannot be possible without science and technology.
On this National Science Day, we will focus on innovation in the country.
Knowledge, technology, all these things should become a simple part of our development journey.
This time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Driveen Innovations.
Friends, sometimes success comes after a long time and when success comes, the vision of the world changes.
If you were very busy in the examination, you might be able to get a lot of news in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that science has been a very big and important discovery in the world.
The world's scientists worked hard, the generations came, they used to do something and after nearly a hundred years a success took place.
The discovery of Gravitational Waves has emerged as a man of our scientists.
This discovery is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery does not just authenticate the theory of our great scientific instincts of the past century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire mankind will work for the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are happy to note that the sons of our country were associated with the honourable scientists of our country in the process of holistic research.
Our scientists will also strive to pursue research in the future.
India will also become a partner in international efforts.
My dear countrymen, we have taken an important decision in the last few days.
In order to achieve even greater success in this discovery, the government has decided to open the laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in a short span of time called Lego in India.
By joining India, this process will get new energy and new momentum.
India will surely become an active partner in this larger scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all the scientists.
You can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by mid-collecting that number from yesterday.
You can also listen to your mother tongue.
I repeat 8108-8108.
81,908-81,908 days, your examination is underway.
You know, tomorrow is the budget.
All of us celebrated the Christmas festival on the day of Paramdise and now preparations for the New Year are underway.
India is full of diversity.
In a way, every festival waits for another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where there is a festival economy.
This becomes the reason for the economic activities of the poor sections of the society.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Christmas and many best wishes for the New Year of 2016.
The year 2016 brings immense happiness for you all.
New zeal, new zeal, new resolve will take you to new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Sawalswarkar has written to me that this season is a climate of tourists.
A large number of tourists from all over the country come here.
People also go for bathing vacations.
The cleaner our tourist destinations, the better India's image will be in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh ji and I am conveying the message of Ganesh ji to the countrymen.
Anyway, we call the Guest of Honour, whenever we have to visit any guest.
Also, in our tourist destinations, in our visiting places, in our visiting places, this is indeed a special emphasis.
However, they are ordinary artisans and they work hard and work hard.
He has done a unique job that has been published by the newspapers.
And when it came to my notice, I also felt that I had conveyed this thing to you.
In Bhojpura, he has constructed 100 toilets so far, considering that this work is a sacred task without his hard work and hard work.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear disappointments about the country.
And that is what makes the country proud and it is natural for them to take pride in Mann Ki Baat for Dilip Singh.
This is the result of the untiring efforts of many people that the country is progressing very fast.
25 billion Indians are moving ahead with one step by one step and the country is also moving forward.
New opportunities for better education, excellent skills and employment.
It is a big task to provide easy credit under the Mudra Yojana to the common man who cannot reach the doorsteps of the bank.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna When Balkrishna opened his mouth and philosophed Mother Yashoda with the whole of the universe.
It has made India self-reliant due to the deficiency of Yoga.
Swachhata is being talked about in a way in the household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
After so many years of independence, the village where the pillars of electricity will reach, the boundaries of the zeal and zeal that will eradicate the darkness of the village cannot be guessed by the people living in the cities who use electricity.
Until now, there is no widespread discussion in the media but I am confident that the media will definitely reach out to such villages and the biggest benefit will be that those employees of the government who are doing this thing will be so satisfying that they have done something that will bring about a change in the lives of a village.
Whether it is a farmer, a poor, a young man or a woman, should all these services be reached or not
That is why it should not be known what the government has done and which government has not worked.
But it should be so that if they are interested in this matter then do not let them go.
Should they also get information for their rights
We should all strive to make the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the right thing for the human beings, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing myself.
I can't do everything alone.
But should I do something of what I am doing
A common citizen can also download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and join me.
And I keep sharing such small things on it.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that people also tell me a lot.
How can I reach without your help 
Let us all together share the interests of the common man in the language of the common man and inspire them to get their rights.
This was followed by all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India is launching the complete Action Plan Action Plan of Startup India, Stand Up India.
And the event will be attended by liv-connectivity all over the country including IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, NITIs and all the youth.
For example, whether it is digital world or IT business, this startup is for them.
No, we have to bring about a change in India's needs.
Market will be available.
In the same way the intellectual property of our youth is limited to certain cities .
This idea is wrong.
The youngsters have talent in the corner of India, the Cham should get the opportunity.
These Startup India, Stand Up India should not be limited to certain cities.
And I also urge the state governments to take this forward.
On January 16, I will be present before you and will discuss this in detail and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanandji.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanandji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year it will be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January.
And I have come to know that this time their theme is because their theme is based on the theme, that the theme is very good. I have been told that more than 10,000 youth are going to gather from all the states and corners of India.
Youth India is a vision of creation.
In a way, dreams have to be fulfilled.
The resolution is about to be realized.
Can you recommend me about this young festival 
I especially urge the young friends that I am the Narendra Modi App.
So I will wait, my friend, to know your thoughts about the Youth Festival on Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, a Visually Challenged Teacher from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, celebrated Accessible India Day in his school.
He has conveyed his heartfelt condolences to me, and celebrated the Excellent India zeal in my school.
We enjoyed schooling and inspired children to help the disabled in society.
I feel that it was the first time that you have done.
Dileep ji thank you very much.
And you yourself are working in this field.
If you understand these things very well then there will be a lot of problems.
Sometimes there is an opportunity to meet such persons in the society, then some thoughts come to our minds.
We also express our vision of visiting them as per our thinking.
And for such people many words have been used in the world, but there has always been contemplation of words.
Every time people feel that the name of this word is not good for them, they dont feel honourable.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I was going to attend that programme.
However, in some districts of Tamil Nadu and particularly in the villages, I could not have attended the launch programme on that day.
But I had to go to that programme. They used to think about something in my mind.
At that time I had thought that God has given some deficiency, some deficiency in the body, one organ is working properly, they are also called handicapped and we know them as handicapped people.
But sometimes when they come to know that we see a deficiency of them from our eyes, but God has given them a special gift.
After that, I was contemplated that from the eyes we feel that it is handicapped but feels that some extra power can be left with it.
And when I came to my mind, why not use the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang' in our country
These are the people who have such organs that have divine organs, which do not belong to the ordinary organs in us.
I like this word very well.
My countrymen, can we popularise the habit of the word Divyang in place of disabilities
I assure you that you will carry this forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, it will facilitate the people with disabilities by improving the internal structure both physically and indirectly.
Whether it is schools, bus stations, railway stations or ramps, comfortable parking, accessibility lifts, braille scripts, how many things are there.
In order to simplify their availability, we need innovation, technology, system, sensitivity.
We have taken up this task.
Public participation is also being received.
It should not be dead in files.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of the schemes are easily available to them.
In our country gas cylinders are being subsidized.
The government made some changes in it.
Be it Jan Dhan Accounts or Aadhaar Card, the largest logistics directory in the world, through the benefit transfer scheme, directly transferring subsidy to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The scheme is known as the initiative and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore cooking gas users have become beneficiaries of the scheme.
14 crore people accounts have been directly transferred to the bank accounts.
No intermediaries, no recommendations are required, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar, on the other hand the opening of Jan Dhan Account, on the third hand the State Government and the Government of India together prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiary's accounts through various schemes.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 schemes are being directly incorporated into the Benifits Transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, a golden moment of the Republic of India is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the dawn of our Constitution is the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
A special discussion was held in the Parliament for two days and it was a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs have made excellent discussions on the sanctity of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, understanding the Constitution in its true form etc.
We should move ahead with this thing.
Can Republic Days truly connect people with the system
Our constitution gives us a lot of rights and the officers are discussed in a cordial manner and should also be done.
But the Constitution also emphasizes duty and obligation.
However, it has been observed that duties are discussed very little.
When elections are held in large numbers, there are publications all around, it is written on the walls, hoardings are placed that it is our sacred duty to vote.
It is a matter of obligation at the time of voting, but why do not there be any obligations in a comfortable life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we compete in schools, colleges in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations by competing on the subject of duties, poetry competition, commitment etc
What a great history can be composed if one or two crore Indians are stunned by their duties.
Can you send me that
I would like to share your thoughts.
He sent me to my portal, MyGov.
I would certainly like to know what the youth of my country thinks about it.
I feel like making a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we observe Republic Day, we are citizens, school colleges, children, statues of great men in our city.
And I am not saying this to the government.
Can we make it our comfortable nature, as a society, as a nation
On 26th January, we all should collectively strive to honour the statues of such great men, to clean the premises and to ensure that these are easily done by the people, by the citizens.
Ladies and Gentlemen, once again my best wishes for the New Year 2016.
You must have got the opportunity to go.
And trade and employment must have started with new enthusiasm.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festivals have a special significance in social life.
Every corner of the world constantly reports about natural calamities and reports of natural calamities that no one has ever heard or thought.
People are also experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
Many people have died.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
The state governments are working with complete efficiency in relief.
The central government also always works closely.
Recently, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But when we talk of crisis all around then we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, the natural disaster was a part of the agriculture sector, as it was limited to the most natural disaster, i. e.
Today its form has changed.
At all levels, it has become imperative for us to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small and big institution has to work very scientifically for capacity building.
After the Nepal earthquake, I spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
And I had suggested to them that the SAARC countries should together make a joint poem for disaster precautions.
I am happy that a network of SAARC countries, Exercise Is and Best Practices symposium and workshop were concluded in Delhi.
A good start.
Today I have received the phone call from Jalandhar, Punjab.
(He speaks from Jalandhar, Punjab District.
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people.
Lakhwinder Singh Ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
Moreover, you are well aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concerns are true but this is not the case in Punjab Haryana alone.
This is our habit throughout India and in a traditional way we are moving on the path of burning the ruins of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very valuable.
It is a biological fertilizer in itself.
We wipe it out.
Moreover, if a small piece of it is made then it becomes a dry fruit for the animals.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the ground gets burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment whether our bones are strong, our hearts strong, the kidneys are good or not, but what will happen if the upper skin of the body burns
Heart cannot survive even if it continues.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our yield to death.
And that is why we should make a positive effort.
It becomes a guarantee even if it is once again plunged into the ground.
Or if some water is poured in a ditch and poured in a pool then it becomes the best biological fertilizer.
Not only this, if we put the fertilizer in the ground, it will also benefit twice as much.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers who had cultivated bananas.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier when he used to cultivate banana and when the banana crop was over, he used to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people who picked it up used to carry trekker-backets, they used to stay there.
However, some farmers have proved that six-six-eight-eight-inch pieces of this piece were planted and they were burnt to the ground.
The water that is in stagnation keeps the crop alive.
Dear countrymen, on the next three December, the International Day of Persons with DCABILITIs will be remembered all over the world.
Last time, Mann Ki Baat discussed my organ donation.
I also discussed the Helpline of the Noto for Organisation.
The Indian Organisation was considered as DoNER Day on 2nd November.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and many well-known people joined the film.
Participation can save valued lives.
When organs go from one body to another then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be given to any other person unless they donate it.
I had earlier said that they are being celebrated as Disabled Day on 3rd December.
Physically and mentally challenged people also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes there is a pain when they enjoy it.
Sometimes a feeling of compassion and kindness is expressed.
But if we change our vision and change our vision then these people can inspire us to live.
It can inspire you to do something.
Even if we have a small problem, we start crying.
Then I remember that my problem is very small, how does it work
And that is why all these are a source of inspiration for us.
Their livelihood is commendable in transforming their minds into capabilities and their way of embracing their lives.
Javed Ahmad, I would like to talk to him today.
40-42 years of age.
In 1966, Javed Ahmad was shot dead by the terrorists.
The ability to stand on his feet has gone for us, but Javed Ahmad did not give up.
Even the wounds of terrorism cannot defeat them.
The body does not support, but for twenty years they have been immersed in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically challenged people 
How to develop arrangements for handicappedness in public offices 
They are working on it.
He also altered his studies in that direction.
He got Master Digri in social work and as a social worker, as an aware citizen, he is making a silent revolution today.
Is not the life of Javed enough to inspire us in every corner of India 
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
I may be talking about Javed in the absence of time but the lamps of such inspiration are flourishing in every corner of India.
They are spreading new lights and showing ways.
On 3rd December, there is an opportunity to inspire all of them by remembering them.
Whether it is the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the Dalit, the oppressed, the deprived, the underprivileged, the government is constantly working with the government.
And as a citizen, one feels a bad feeling from someone else's government babu.
And it changes our vision of looking at the government system forever.
Often we dont even know because it is so easy that we dont know that any government system, any government servant is doing this thing.
In our country, ASHA workers are networks all over the country.
We have never heard of ASHA workers among the people of India, nor have you heard of it.
But when I am the world famous family interpreter of Bill Gates Foundation, his success has become a phenomenon in the world.
When we jointly embraced such Bill Gates and Milinda Gates,
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever earns during his retirement and lifetime, he is being used for the work of the poor.
In the last few days, the Odisha government had specially honoured an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
They should be treated on the basis of the preliminary systems that have been learnt.
Emphasis should be given to every household using insecticides.
As our children sleep well and take care of them, Mani Singh of Asha Varkar Jamuna is working with full dedication to protect the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he fought in front of the Malaria and prepared it to meet the entire village.
How many Jamunamani would be there when it came to pass
Many lakhs of people will be around us.
We will look at them with respect.
Such people become so vulnerable to our country.
How big is the society's happiness and sorrow
I salute all such hope workers through Jamunamani.
In the context of an e-book inspiring event of Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of MPs and health sectors.
I urge you to look at it.
Look, not only this, but also show others.
Read it and you may feel like adding something like this.
You must be Mygov.
in.
These things do not come very fast in our minds but they are the right thing for the society.
Positive potential is the biggest energy.
You also tell about good events - sharing them.
You can become a social teacher in the true sense.
The temperature of the earth should not rise now.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also a concern.
And this is the first way to save the temperature.
14th December is National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, the light of the moon should be darkened after shutting off the streets of Sheri.
It should experience the moonlight.
When a friend sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, I felt like telling you this thing.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have had the privilege of studying more on TV.
But they are doing such a thing that perhaps no one would have thought.
He is working with solar energy to give a boost to the poor using solar energy.
He has created a committee of women and has set up a plant of solar energy fertilizers.
And they pay a monthly rent of Rs. 100.
People take funs in the evening, they come back in the morning and give it for charging.
And in a large number, I have heard that people from 500 households come.
Now look at what the biggest people of the world would do for climate change, but a narrow slave is doing such a thing to inspire everyone.
And the meaning of Noorjahan is to publish the world.
He is spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjahan and congratulate i TV because they presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the nation and the world.
Many congratulations.
I have received a call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the senior Prime Minister how these Mudra Banks are being supported by adventurers like us.
Mudra encourages business enterprises.
Mudra creates opportunities for earnings.
And Mudra empowers in the true sense.
The Mudra Yojana is underway to help the youngsters.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Im happy that there are about 24 lakh women in 66 lakhs of these women who are smokers, handicrafts, printers, milk sellers, small traders and small traders.
And most of those who receive this help are SCs, STs, OBCs, who try to run their family with dignity by working hard on their own.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his zeal.
I have a lot of news.
Someone has just told me that there is a Shailesh buzz in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he received a loan of Rs. 8.
And he started trading in Suez Drace Safi.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhosle did it.
They have brought a tank and they have been working and I have been told that in such a short span of time they have paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
This is the purpose under our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to raise money from more interest.
And earlier due to excessive interest and other reasons the money that was spent was now being saved by about one thousand rupees per month due to their coming into their hands.
And a good business of his family also started increasing gradually.
However, I would like that there should be more propaganda of the scheme.
May all our banks become more sensitive and help smaller people.
Indeed, these people run the country's economy.
Only those who do small things are economically intelligent.
We also want to insist on it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
This is what the society should constantly be aware of.
What is the framework of the program .
What is logo 
How to increase public participation 
I had asked for all these suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming up.
But I still expect more suggestions.
I expect a lot of chocolate schemes.
And I have been told that those who participate in it will get certificates.
Some big prizes have been announced.
You can also run your creative mind.
This mantra of unity integrity can be made a mantra to connect this mantra with Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
Whether it is a living person or a living person or a living person or whether it is easy to connect with everyone, what should the government do
What does the society do 
What does civil society do 
There may be many things.
I am confident that your suggestions will be required.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has come.
I would urge you to use this good weather for a while to keep your body healthy.
And we have to create an environment in the family, a family festival, an hour together.
You will see how the consciousness comes and how the body supports the whole day.
So if there is good weather then good habits can also be adopted .
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind...
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you.
Once again I am fortunate to join you with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to play the fifth one-day match in Mumbai.
This category has been given the name of Gandhi-Mandela series.
And that is why the last match has grown significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Kendra of Akashwani.
I would like that if we look at such awareness and active people in our respective areas of the country then our aim of running the country with public participation will get a new strength.
And that is why I conclude my heartfelt congratulations to all the friends of the Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School, Chittor have written a letter to me in Kerala.
The letter is special in many ways.
Firstly, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with the mark of their thumb.
I have sent a picture of the map of India.
Earlier, I was very surprised to see why they made Indias maps with their thumb impressions.
But when I read his letter I realized that he had given a very good symbolic message.
These are the girls who have just tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is campaigning for public awareness for part donation.
He has also staged dramas at various places to understand peoples participation.
Organ donation becomes a process and activity.
These girls have written to me in a letter that please appeal to the people about your organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have a lot of messages on the phone call.
Devesh ji of Delhi has also given me such a message.
Every ten lakh persons have taken the ambitious goal of donating one by one, a very fruitful step taken by the government.
I feel that this thing is very important.
More than two and a half lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 1. 25 billion, we can achieve only five thousand transplants.
Every year there is a need of one lakh eyesight.
And we can reach only twenty five thousand cavals.
We can only give one in front of the need for four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the written plate and speed it up.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of Organ donation.
Several social institutions, many voluntary organizations are working very well in this direction.
The National Organisation and Teacher Transplant Organization-NOTO has been set up to promote organ transplant transplantation.
A Helpline of 1800 1140 working hours is also available.
And we have been told there that is the legend.
It is indeed an excellent description of the joy of sacrifice.
A few days ago, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Let us acknowledge the spirit of a vibrant legacy and give us the momentum to do so.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have recently celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days we will also celebrate Deepawali.
Id also celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
India-Africa Forens Summit is being organized tomorrow from 26th to 2nd October in New Delhi, the capital of India.
This is the first time that such a large scale event is being organized on the soil of India.
Chauppan African countries and union leaders have been invited.
Outside Africa, one of the largest conferences of African countries is being organized.
India-Africa relations are close.
The number of population of India is that of African countries.
And if we both get together, we are a third of the worlds population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago this was the same hunger.
Later these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have a good deal of natural resources.
And nearly 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural and political ties.
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India in human resource development, capacity addition.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have studied in India.
So how deep we are
And from that point of view, this Summit is very important.
Generally, when the Summit meets, the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, the meeting of the Heads of the Summit is going to take place.
But it is our endeavor that people should also meet in it.
Approximately 100 schools participated in it.
It also included schools outside India and India.
And thousands and thousands of schoolchildren wrote about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition titled 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is moving from Porbandar to the Northern states, reaching Delhi on the 22nd October.
Millions of school children witnessed the exhibition.
The people of the village witnessed how Mahatma Gandhi had played a major role in Africa and India's relations, how Mahatma Gandhi's personality had influenced both the landscape.
Children from schools in different parts of our country are also very visually broad and very closely imagined.
Although the Joo Summit is of India-Africa, we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate all the children participating in the competition, over 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on 15th August, I had made a proposal on the MPAGY.
Thereafter, a lot of Parliamentarians have done this thing.
They were very fond of it.
A workshop was organized in Bhopal last month.
Out of these, the Sarpanchs there, the collectors there, some MPs there, the Government of India, the Government of the Republic of India, all of them together discussed the issue of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Several new things came to mind and we learnt very encouraging things.
I would certainly like to bring some of these things to your notice.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very big region, a tribal area.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to become an ideal village.
It was also difficult for government employees to go there.
I congratulate the Honble Member of Parliament, Shriman Karia Mundaji.
And in a way, this school provides education for children in the morning and teachings for children in the evening.
And these children taught about five hundred and fifty illiterates while studying them.
We see that there is no budgetary system in the society, no representative, no special system, but we see how big a transformation can be brought about with the will of the people through Pudi Gram Panchayat.
This village is well known for sugarcane production and kurtay balls in the state.
Shri Ruwala ji started the Kurtaya Galle Sherdi Festival in this village on 11th March.
People of old public life also came here.
The government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was also organized to increase the sale of sugarcane.
How can we make the village a centre of economic activity, how can we harvest village production
Ruwala ji is indeed a complimentary officer for his efforts to build a self-reliant village along with an ideal village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and not a matter of cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent a message to me through telephone: We are cleaning our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
On this day, let us keep the outside environment clean along with our homes and keep it clean even after Diwali.
He pointed to the correctness.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you that after the festivals of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media, had started a big zeal. And whenever there was a lot of stroke after Diwali, they said that it was not okay.
All the media had launched a campaign of awareness.
And as a result of this, a cleanliness drive was launched immediately after Diwali.
So, Savita ji, it is true that we should do as much of our concerns before the festival after the festival.
Every public programme should be organized.
And today I would like to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
On 2nd October, I was fortunate to participate in the Safaigiri Summit organized by India Today Group on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He gave away the Clean India Awards and I was also seeing how many activities are going on.
For this, however, people themselves are acting like One Like One Mission.
What are the places in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things came to light and I conveyed my heartfelt gratitude to the commendable work of the India Today Group at that time.
Through e-TV, they have been continuously promoting the work of cleanliness for the last one year.
He has added 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Whether it is a public place, a station, a religious place, a hospital or a garden or a garden, a massive campaign of cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now these reports show the power to realise the dream of Swachh Bharat in their own right.
The Mission Clean India is the hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of prints and thousands of prints.
And that is why according to the suggestions given by Savita Raiji, today the entire country is considering this thing as its own and is following it.
From Meghalaya, our Governor has written a letter to Hon'ble Shanmugnath.
And through that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past few years, this village has faced the challenge of cleanliness, and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he had received the award for the cleanest village in Asia.
I am happy to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in far-flung North-East of our country which has been in the field of cleaning for years.
This has become the nature of the citizens and the culture of the village.
This is the only thing that believes in all of us that our country will be clean.
And when we will commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2017, we can proudly say that the Jews have freed our mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August that there are many such things that have become a house of corruption.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know how to deal with the difficulties he faces, how to lend money to him.
I have never heard that there is a psychology in the world that takes a person completely in a two-minute interview.
And I had announced this idea that why should we not abolish the tradition of Interview for small jobs
My young friends, today I would like to proudly say that the government has completed all the procedures and now the interview will not be taken on non-gazetted posts of Group D Group C and Group B of the Central Government.
The Rule shall come into force from 1st January, 2016.
We will not put any obstacles in the process currently underway, but it will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country in a way.
Gold is considered as a medium of economic security.
Crisis time cheese is considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will pay you interest on it.
Earlier we used to keep gold in the Lokar and we had to pay the Lokar rent.
Now I will put the gold in the bank and the bank will give you the money as interest.
Speak patriots cannot become wealth now
Whether the dead of gold can change from financing to living power or not
Just this is what we have to do, please give me support.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Its security and interest are two benefits.
Definitely take advantage.
There is another scheme Sovereign Gold Bond in which there is no gold link in your hands but there is a paper.
However, the price of this paper is more than one gold and on the day you return this paper, the price of gold will be refunded to you.
So we are launching these schemes.
Because of this, we will no longer have to buy gold.
So, this scheme of security guarantee will be presented to the countrymen next week.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
It has been almost 70 years since our independence but we have been using only foreign gold coins so far or have been using gold boolean bars.
Why should not our country have indigenous markets 
Therefore, in the next week and before Ghanteras, Indian gold coins of 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka cycle are being started.
Besides, 20 gram gold bullen will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat reminds Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel of the map of Indra Bharat.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
Iron has shown its potential as a man.
We will pay our homage to Sardar Saheb but his dream of uniting India was that he had geographically demonstrated, but this mantra of unity should continuously become the medium of our thinking, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Our country is full of many creeds, numerous sects, many dialects, many species, many dresses, many diverse diversity and this is the diversity that makes us proud.
If this is not a diversity then perhaps we cannot take pride in the splendor.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the tricks of development.
Over the last few years, on 31st October, Run for Unity programmes are being organised across the country.
I have heard that this time too it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the race for unity.
The race for unity is in the true sense of development.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race for unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Increase the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting the United Kingdom on the second day of Diwali.
I am very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such classes of society, be it Dalits, tribals, backward classes, their talented children who go abroad to study.
I am confident that this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for him when our children of India will study in Britain.
And that is why I am very excited about my visit to Britain.
And you can imagine the kind of joy that people like me will be able to enjoy if that building is going to be a house for millions and millions of Indians with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
I will also get another opportunity in London and unveil the statue of Lord Basweshwar.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Basweshwar had done for democracy, for women empowerment is indeed a learning aspect of the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Basweshwar to the household of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India used to think and think centuries ago.
You know that whenever such incidents are connected, the hearts of all our countrymen get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, there are discussions about the skyline of your letters.
Government officials are called upon and discussed.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
We have a good relationship between us.
Last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering a new year.
Once again my best wishes to my fellow countrymen.
Jai Hind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, please all of you.
I have had a fundamental idea in my life and because of this I have a lot of faith in the power of the people. However, I can say from what Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what has been explained, what has been understood and what has been experienced, I can say that peoples strength is greater than what we think.
Our ancestors used to say that peoples responsibilities are part of God.
I can say from my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have immense power, immense power, because I have realized that I had been suggesting for Mann Ki Baat and could talk only about two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to be active and inform me that this is a very powerful force.
Yes, these lakhs of letters have also given me great teachings.
Different departments of the government analyzed peoples letters and what are those things about policy, what is the personal question, which is not in the government's mind.
Who had thought that the source of these information would become Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that the selfie with the doctor and the whole world were surprised.
Perhaps in all the countries of the world, what is the pride that someone has achieved in the number of lakhs of selfie with doctors and daughters
And when he used to do selfie with doctor, he not only encouraged his daughter but also committed himself.
When people looked at it, they felt that the neglect of the daughters would now be feasible.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in view the tourism of India, I had told the same citizens that if you go to Incredible India, if there is a good picture then I will see it.
The tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government has never thought that we have such a beautiful legacy.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is not the demand of the hour now or the Khadi for fashion
Today, I say with great satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
On a TV channel, I had seen that an retired teacher was standing on a widow's line to give up his subsidy.
The common people of the society, the middle class, the lower middle class, for which it is difficult to leave the subsidy, but such people left behind.
Is not this a silent revolution 
Is not this the philosophy of people 
Governments must also learn from the teachings that the work done in our government offices is a very powerful, energetic and determined society outside Umbara.
We made every small thing ourselves and tried to connect ourselves with the good of the country.
What can be a big satisfaction with this .
This time I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I had requested the citizens of the country to telephonize your questions and suggestions.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a very pleasant experience.
People of all age groups have given a message.
I liked to hear some of the messages myself and I felt good.
My team is working on the rest.
You may have taken a minute or two minutes but for me your phone call, your message is very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising for me and it was a pleasure.
However, it seems as if there is negativeness and negativeness all around.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had to speak their own words.
However, I am surprised to know that all these things were the same as in the light of Mann Ki Baat.
Fully positive, informative, creative.
People have said that more than 70 per cent of the remaining energy consuming and enjoying things have been said.
They must have listened to the radio.
I was reminded of the importance of radio for the blind.
I see a new dimension and say such good things, these people and the government are also sufficient to sensitize them.
I have given a message from Alwar Rajasthan to Pawan Acharya.
Listen to what they want to say - "My name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I am confident that like Pawan, your feelings will certainly reach every corner of India.
We have suggested that soil should not be priceless and therefore soil lamps are also priceless.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the army personnel.
Whether it is our navy, the ground forces, the air warriors, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy, the Navy and the Navy.
The war that took place in 1965, it completed 50 years with Pakistan.
On this occasion, a Shouryanjali exhibition has been set up near India Gate in Delhi.
From the point of view of history, we can learn a lot and if we look for inspiration in life then perhaps there cannot be any bigger inspiration than this to serve the motherland.
Whether it is of war or of war or of north or of Chamunda or of victory scenes near Hajipir, it is thrilling and our army is proud of the soldiers.
My meeting with these brave families also happened to meet the families of the martyrs and those who took part in the war are now in the north era of their lives.
If you want to make history, it is important to understand history in depth.
I have returned in two and a half hours but you will definitely take three to four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has instructed the elderly but that child has forgotten his name in a hurry.
We should also create a habit of cleanliness and also create a system for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from the message of this child.
I also have to hear a lot.
I see the best of these things that the Parliament of the country is also discussing about the cleanliness of India.
And on the other hand look at the Parliament and on the one hand the children of this country talk about cleanliness - what can be the good fortune of a big country
The movement that is underway - the atmosphere of hatred towards dirt - awareness about cleanliness - will also enable and enable governments to work.
And if there is a deficiency then we have to move forward and in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, let us work towards fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once he said: If I want to choose one of the two freedoms and cleanliness, I would like to select cleanliness first. After independence, there was more importance than freedom for Gandhi.
Gulshan Arora ji from Delhi has sent a message to Maya Gau.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men are always a source of inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to evaluate the ideas of our great men.
If you take any date, any one of the glimpses of history will get the name of a great man.
Let us recall all these great men in the days to come, let us convey the message of their lives to every household and let us also try to learn something from them.
I would like to especially urge you once again for 2nd October.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes, all kinds of fabrics, all kinds of fabrics, but there should be a place for Khadi.
Once again I have said that Khadi is free from 2nd October to 1st month.
We should take advantage of this.
And the handloom along with Khadi should also be equally important.
And that is why we must place Khadi in our homes and place it on our body.
And when we saw it, we almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefitted.
You people have done the work that the government cannot do with the publication of billions of rupees.
This is the manpower and that is why I once again urge you to do this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very happy to note one thing.
It is heartening that you should also get a little taste of this happiness.
I had gone to Kolkata in the month of May and I had come to meet the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
His brother Chandra Bose had organised everything.
I had the opportunity to spend a happy evening with the family members of Subhas Babu for a long time.
Can you imagine how happy I would have for you
Perhaps for the first time in his life, the family members of Netaji would have come together to visit the Prime Minister's residence.
But more than that, it is a matter of happiness for me that I have never had the privilege of such a hospitality in the prime minister's residence, which I am going to meet in October.
More than 50 people from Subhash Babu and people from all over the country live in different parts of the country, all people are coming in special ways.
I got a message from Bhargavi Kande and after listening to his voice, I felt that he feels like a leader himself and perhaps he will become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to make a statement to the elderly that you should awaken the younger generation about water registration so that the participation of the younger generation increases in the coming days and the important collaboration of the younger generation in the future is being chosen and run by the government.
Every voter in the democracy has the fate of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Election Commission is working as a single controller but in the last few years there has been a major change in it.
Today, our Election Commission has become a facilitator in a way that is not just a controller, it has become a facilitator, it has become a voter friend and it has become a voter friend in all its ideologies.
The electoral roll should be upgraded and we should also keep looking at it.
I am telling you in the election season that after the first polling, water will be consumed.
What a sacred task everyone should do.
On the supreme day, I visited Kashi.
Once I got a seventh grade student named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh standard in the Kendriya Vidyalaya at Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is very intelligent.
But at such a young age, I saw his interest in physics research.
He was very proud to know what kind of sensitivities should be there in robots.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child why 
How to do 
When .
This child should ask the mind .
Similarly, I had to meet Sonam Patel, a very small child.
She is nine years old.
This daughter of Sadabrij Patel, a beautiful resident of Varanasi, is a daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the whole song of that child is fond of him.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him he used to say Shlok, he used to interpret it in English and used to define it in Hindi.
Reads only songs or is there any other song
When we take history, we face it in the evening.
We all wonder, how is it so talented in the entire family
I was really impressed.
Sometimes some children have a hobby of celebrity but there was no such thing in Sonam.
Apart from what you see on TV, read in newspapers, we do a lot of work and sometimes we also enjoy such things.
Similarly, my interactions with these two children were memorable for me.
I have seen that some people bring me a lot of work in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to be so frustrated to do this once in a month, I have to adjust the time so much.
Sometimes my friends from the sky have to sit and wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestions.
Now it is better than a month.
Mann Ki Baat has been completed one year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used to use radio 
From Germany, he started his radio and used to constantly identify the citizens of India with regard to the freedom movement.
He started the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly News bulletin.
He used to run this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu.
Now it has been a year since I talked about Mann Ki Baat on the sky.
I am also talking about you and this is my satisfaction.
I will meet again for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending the suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Amendments begin.
Your contribution is valuable to me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, pleasure to all of you
Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
People in far flung areas are celebrating Onam and yesterday the entire nation celebrated Raksha Bandhan's holy festival.
In view of social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, everyone has adopted these schemes in a big way.
I had made a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we should give this security scheme to our sisters.
The primary information that I have received is that from the beginning of this scheme so far, about 150 crore families have joined this scheme.
Moreover, I was told that almost half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider this auspicious sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a large scale.
Why would it happen in such a short span of time that the work that has not been done for eighty years
I also saw the poor people.
Shunya was about to open the account with balance.
But the poor saved Rs. 25,000 crore.
Youngsters have been employed.
You will be pleased to know that in this one year, one lakh thirty three thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
There is no need to stop opening accounts only.
And now thousands of people have become officers of overdraft under Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it
And there was a belief that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and now it is your duty to keep it alive.
Our accounts should be active.
You must do this, I believe that.
Last day, the incidents of Gujarat, the dash of violence, made the whole country a bench.
But in a very short span of time all my enlightened citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took care of the situation.
We played an active role before the situation was over and once again Gujarat walked on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brothers - this is the right path.
And we have to walk on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I have got the opportunity to hear the kind of experiences that I have experienced that I have got the opportunity to listen to them that in a way some music is playing.
I felt very good.
Perhaps it has become the most important thing in the world to realize the true nature of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and generosity will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that we may believe in any community but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my privilege.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodhgaya.
First Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
I will have the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to tell you a special mention today.
I have already mentioned this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, heard me in the public meetings, listened to me in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been telling you once again that the government's mind is open on the issue of disputes regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the interest of the farmers.
But today I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the reforms in the Land Acquisition Act have come through the states that if we want to provide water to the villages, if we want to provide water to the poor farmers, if we have to construct a pillar to provide electricity to the villages, if we have to construct a road for the village, if we have to build a house for the poor people of the village and if we have to make arrangements for the employment of the poor youth of the village then we will have to leave the law from the clutches of this enforcement democracy.
And then there was a proposal for amendment.
However, I saw that the fear was spread so much that the farmers were so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My farmer should not be frustrated and should not be afraid.
And I dont want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears the farmers and misleads the farmers.
We presented an Ordinance.
Ordinance is being completed on the 3rd of August, 2018.
And I have decided that it should be abolished.
It means that the situation that was before my government was re-established.
But one of them was incomplete.
And that is why we had brought them in Ordinance but due to these disputes this issue has also been misconstrued.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not just a slogan but it is our mantra.
Villages, welfare of poor farmers.
And that is why on 15th August I had said that not only the Agriculture Department but the Department of Agriculture and Welfare will be formed.
And when it comes to the battle of 165, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to recall the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
It is also very natural to remember all those martyrs who have kept the Tricolour of India alive.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 War.
And I am glad that India is doing a great job in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are really doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these researches to the masses .
How to convert principles into tools 
How to connect labels with land 
We have to take this forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an extremely inspiring experience for me.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting I feel that there is a lot of opportunity, there are many possibilities.
I get a lot of letters from citizens.
He has written about Skill Development.
From Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, Smt. Prakash Tripathi stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I have also spoken to my young friends.
I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August that why the interview for lower level jobs
And when an Interview call comes then where will every poor family, widow and mother get the emotions
Poor people do not have to run for enforcement.
There should be no exploitation, there should be no corruption.
These days there have been delegates from many countries of the world in India.
For health, especially for maternal mortality and infant mortality rate, the call-to-action for its action plan was jointly deliberated upon by twenty-four countries of the world.
This is the first time that this programme has been organised in any other country outside the USA.
However, reforms have increased.
India has started to be appreciated internationally, but this figure is not small.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the deaths of mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Today the news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but it is very easy to save.
And it is directly linked to the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about.
We need advertising on TV.
There is widespread public education in this regard, but we do not care.
I would urge you all to say that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is very valued.
Discussion about water, satisfaction about sanitation becomes a cause of death.
Free dengue testing facilities are available across the country at around 50-four centres.
Cleanliness should be of utmost importance.
These days, in a way, there is a festival in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali.
Why should not every festival of ours be connected with cleanliness
You know, Sanskrit will become a nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, however, in his heart, the spirit of serving the tribals of India is strong.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
These two brothers won the race this year.
It has enhanced Indias dignity.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am extremely delighted to note that they have been doing this entire mission with the intention of relaxing the Team India-Vision for Tribals.
Look, what kind of efforts everybody is making to take the country forward
And when we hear such incidents then the chest bloats.
Sometimes because of perception we commit serious injustice to our youth.
My experience with regard to youngsters is different.
Sometimes we also learn a lot when we talk to the youngsters.
I have met many youngsters who say, "Brothers and sisters, I have lived in a lifetime that is "Sand on Cycle".
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day a week.
Today, I especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand, divine, inspiring memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar, now that the Maharashtra government is going to build, will be an inspiration for us when the Indians travelling across the world will go to London.
I bow down to both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar for the Government of Maharashtra.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Once again, after a long distance, we are launching Mann Ki Baat amongst you, Talks of the people, Talks of the people, Talks of the people, Lokmanya.
Sitting in the midst of him, he used to listen, repeat and sometimes our own words became an inspiration for us as a family of 130 crore Indians.
You can imagine that the interim period must have gone.
Perhaps this was not a lifeless programme.
I used to miss something every minute and when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I might say that the words are mine, but the story is yours, the meaning of man is yours, the hero is yours.
I used to use my words and my words and because of that I was missing you, not this programme.
It was an empty feeling.
However, on Sunday, we had to wait a lot.
Well, the last opportunity has been received.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, small, light, society, life which becomes the cause of change.
In a way, this sequence gives rise to a new spirit and in a way supports the quest for a New India.
I feel passionate.
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the world.
This is my journey from Aham to Vyam.
For me, my silent interaction with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot about how I was going to Kedarnath in the race for elections.
Most of them have made a political implication.
For me, this was the opportunity to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity - I think that I will discuss it sometimes.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, I have been consistently feeling in your thoughts and efforts to strengthen one positive thing.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are totally different from the regular government work.
Sometimes the work of pushing my thought process forward makes you a few words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is showing his disapproval of dirt but he also preaches the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment, he feels the pain, but at the same time he also tells us the experiments he has seen and also illustrates the imaginations he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I feel the glimpse of how to solve the problems in the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a recipe for the country and the society.
It shows us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent within our countrymen.
The need is to incorporate this strength and talent, to provide opportunities and to activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also says that all 130 crore countrymen want to connect with the strength and proactiveness of the country's development. And I must say one thing that I have received so many telephone calls in Mann Ki Baat but the essence of grievances is very low and if someone wants something for himself then I have not noticed the same thing in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how much pleasure my heart might have got, how much energy I might have got.
You have brought me here, you have settled me and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, let us move ahead with the pledge of Mann Ki Baat.
When there was a crisis in the country, the opposition was not confined to the political sphere, it was not confined to the politicians.
There was an anger in the hearts of the people.
There was a thirst for the lost democracy.
It is not known what hunger is when eating day and night, just like the enjoyment of the rights of democracy in normal life, it is known only when someone snatches democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country had started feeling that something had been snatched away.
Perhaps in any country of the world, everybody in the country has voted for a democracy, not just for the sake of their own rights, for the sake of democracy.
Recently, the festival of democracy, a massive election campaign was concluded in our country, from Amir to poor, everybody was eager to share the future of our country with happiness.
Whenever any cheese is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing facts are also ignored.
These numbers may seem very common to us but if I say that we leave a China then more than any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2017 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total number of people in the United States, almost two times.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
It reflects the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The 2017 Lok Sabha elections were the worlds largest democratic elections in history.
You can imagine the need for resources and manpower at a large scale to complete such elections.
Elections can be made possible by the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff day and night.
In order to successfully conclude this great personality of democracy, where about 3 lakh paramilitary security personnel took up their responsibility, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also executed their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more votes have been cast than before.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big tumors are.
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voters are deprived of their votes.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one female polling station was constructed.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel there for two or two days - this is the true honor of democracy.
India is also the highest polling station in the world.
The polling station is located at an altitude of 1500 ft in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is a more proud fact in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted enthusiastically like men.
The percentage of women and men voted in this election was almost the same.
One more enthusiastic fact is that today there are 8 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the electoral process and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth that 'Buke not Book' was my request that we can give books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Someone recently gave me a book titled Premchand Ki Popular Stories, I felt very good.
However, I could not get much time but during the tour I got the opportunity to re-read some of his stories.
His narratives expressing human emotions in simple language touched my heart too.
Their interpretations include the spirit of the whole of India.
When I was reading his stories of intoxication, my mind went on its own to the economic odds in the society.
I was reminded of the days of my youth how discussions were held over this subject overnight.
It is learnt from the words of the son of the landlord, Goddess and the valour of the poor family that if you are not cautious then the impact of a bad world can never be known.
The second episode that touched my heart was 'Idgah'.
A child's sensitivity, a pure love for his grandmother, such a maturity in such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches his grandfather with a chipyo from the fair, indeed human emotions reach its peak.
In this interaction, a lively portrait of the life of a poor farmer was noticed.
Despite the loss of their crops, the sugarcane farmers are so happy that they do not have to sleep in the field in extreme cold.
Though this conversation is about a century ago, its relevance still feels the same.
After reading this, I got a different kind of experience.
When I was talking about reading, I used to read about Kerala's letter library in some media.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of the primary school here, P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here tied in potla and laid on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
The 'Vanche Gujarat' campaign in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Lakhs of people from all ages participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take out some time and place books in your daily routine.
You will actually do a lot of enjoyment and write on Narendra Modi App about all the books that you read so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issue which is a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many people have written to me about water related challenges besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
In the Suktam of Rig Veda, it is said about water, , . . . that is, water itself is the source of life-energy, energy.
Give your blessings like your mother, like your mother, your grace keeps on showering on us.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water that is received during the entire year is saved in our country.
Only 8.
Now it is time to solve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will solve this problem with the participation of the people, with the power of the people, with the strength, cooperation and determination of 1.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
This will take rapid decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote letters to Sarpanchs from all over the country, to the Gram Pradhans.
I have written to the Gram Pradhans that they should discuss the issue of water conservation, water conservation, rain drops and water conservation, sitting in the Gram Sabha and sitting with the villagers.
I am glad that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People took a pledge to collect one drop of water in the village.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are ready to play their active role once again for water conservation.
My best wishes to every Gram Pradhan and every Sarpanch for their activeness.
There are several such Sarpanches across the country that have taken up the issue of water conservation.
In a way, this has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now competing to construct a Jal Mandir in their villages.
As I said, collective efforts can have very positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for coming out of water crisis all over the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But everyones goal is to save water and conserve water.
Trainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
Construction of tanks in Themaipalli, Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the village.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, there has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about those women from Garhwal who have been working very well on the Rainwater Harvesting.
I believe that many such efforts are being made and when we strive together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will join and save water.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I request three people.
My initiatives are: Just as the countrymen have transformed cleanliness into a mass movement, let us initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all take a pledge to save every drop of water together. And I believe that water is the source of God, water is the form of mercury.
Earlier it was said that iron becomes gold from the touch of mercury.
I say that water is mercury and mercury creates a new life by touching water.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell us about the problems related to water and also propagate ways to save water.
I specially urge all stakeholders from different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is the field of film industry, sports, our friends in the media, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, people who make stories, people who lead this movement in their own way.
It connects the society, it connects the society, it connects the society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My next request is that many traditional methods are being used for the protection of water in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to go to the place of birth of Porbandar, venerable Bapu then there is another house behind the house of venerable Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is water and there is a provision to stop rain water then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes to see the water stream.
There will be many such experiments everywhere.
Let us inspire people for water conservation by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You can share your contribution using JanShakti4JalShaktiHashtag.
My dear countrymen, I also want to express my gratitude for one thing and also to express my gratitude to the people of the world.
Once again on 21st June, on the occasion of Yoga Day, three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day with fervor.
The greatness of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for the Holistic Health Care.
In every corner of the world, if a lover of Yoga welcomes it as soon as the sun rises, then it is the entire journey till Suraj Athamwa.
Perhaps there will be a place where there is a human being and there is no link between yoga and Yoga.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from AC gyms to deserts, from villages to cities, wherever possible, not only Yoga was done at all such places but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and common citizens of many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive persons are required to build a healthy society and yoga ensures that.
Therefore, the propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service.
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for their outstanding contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to those organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly in the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take the 'Japan Yoga Niketan' which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Several institutes and training courses are conducted by Japan Yoga Niketan or MSMEs.
Take the name of Antonietta Rozzi, who started the 'Sarva Yoga International' and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
This is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a matter related to yoga then can Indians remain behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger were also honoured and dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and set up a Jeevan Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
The broad celebrations of Yoga and the honour of those who delivered the message of Yoga at home have made this Yoga Day special.
It is a very big journey for me to connect with your thoughts, Mann Ki Baat.
Let us keep meeting, let us keep talking.
Keep listening to your feelings, staying right and understanding.
Sometimes he tried to live up to that feeling.
May your blessings continue.
You are my inspiration, you are my strength.
Let us come together to enjoy Mann Ki Baat and fulfil the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India had lost her daughter-in-law.
These brave heroes sacrificed their lives for the protection of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Our brave sons had united day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the braves in the Pulwama terror attack, the hearts and minds of the people of the whole country are shocked and indignant.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have emerged.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to face the challenges faced by the country by forgetting the differences between rationalism, communalism, territorialism and all others so that our actions against terrorism are even stronger than before.
Our Armed Forces have been introducing unparalleled courage and valour from time to time.
Together they have demonstrated their magnificent potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also been given answers in their language.
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has resolved to eliminate the hostility of terrorists and their helpers.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the motivational aspects of their family members have been given to the entire nation by the media.
Ramniranji, the father of the martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all in this hour of grief.
He has said that he will send his second daughter to fight against the enemy and if necessary, he will also fight himself.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, Mr.
They have also pledged to recruit one of their daughters in the CRPF.
When the body of Martyr Vijay Soren jumped into Triranga and reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his daughter-in-law said that I too will join the fountain.
The spirit of this masum reflects the spirit of a single child across India.
Such feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave martyrs.
I appeal to the younger generation to try to understand and understand the spirit they have shown by these families.
What is sacrifice, penance We do not need to go towards an ancient event of history.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty ji of Udupi Karnataka expressed his happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised that there was no national war memorial in India.
It is a memorable remembrance that the heroic legends of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation can be kept safe.
I decided that there should be such a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will dedicate this National Army Memorial to our Army.
The country will make such a small effort to repay its debt.
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Yojana are located, a new memorial has been built just close to it.
I am confident that it will be appropriate for our countrymen to go to this National Soldiers Memorial at any shrine.
This is the National Soldiers Memorial reflecting the gratitude of the nation towards those who made the supreme sacrifice after Independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the indomitable courage of our armed forces.
Amar Chakra reflects the immortality of the martyred soldiers.
The second circle is of valour and valour of the soldiers.
Thereafter, there are vacancies.
This Circle shows the sacrifices of soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters.
After that the protective cycle exhibits security.
This circle consists of dense trees.
On seeing this, the National Army Memorial will be identified as a place where people will be able to study their gratitude to know about the great martyrs of the country and the words of those who sacrificed their lives here.
Those who laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
Last year, in the month of October, I had also got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to those men and women police personnel who are busy in our security.
I hope you must visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, thousands of your letters and comments keep getting me read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comments, I noticed a very interesting copy of Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He writes that when the British captured Birsa Munda on 3rd March in 100, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
He further writes that both these individuals belong to a completely different family background, which enriched the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is apt to bow down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have illuminated the name of not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When he was asleep, the British hid themselves and held them very carefully.
Do you know why the British took the help of such draconian actions 
Because the British who had such a great empire were also afraid of them.
Lord Birsa Munda had just stirred up the British rule with guns and guns from his traditional tactics.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, the collective will power of the people falls on the strength of the weapons.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight for political freedom against the British.
But the tribals had also fought for social and economic rights.
They have done this in their short lives.
In the dark life of the underprivileged and the deprived, he shined like a sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed himself at a young age of 25 years.
Mother India like Birsa Munda has come to all parts of the country.
There should not be any corner of India that no one has contributed to this centuries-long freedom struggle.
But unfortunately, their sacrifices, valour and sacrifices have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda has realized his identity as a person then a great personality like Jamshedji Tata gave the country a big institution.
Jamshedji Tata was a visionary who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a hub of science technology and industry.
This led to the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, now called the Indian Institute of Science (Indian Institute of Science).
Not only that, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on 2nd February.
You all are aware that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is the record of presenting the highest budget in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India in such a difficult time when there was a danger to the democratic tension of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai jumped into the anti-crisis movement to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price even in old age.
The government of that time grabbed them and put them in jail.
But when the Peoples Party won the elections in 1971, they became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also provided that the original rights enjoyed under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be repealed.
It was for the first time that the President would announce the crisis only after the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the time of the crisis cannot be increased more than six months in a single month.
Thus, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which the democracies were killed in the 15th century cannot be repeated in the future.
The generations to come will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the month of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very excited about Padma Awards this year too.
Today, we proceed on the path of a New India, in which we want to honour those people who are doing their jobs at the grassroots level.
Those who are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in a variety of ways with their hard work.
In fact, he is a true Karmayogi who stands for the service of the people, for the service of the society and for the service of the nation.
I would like to tell you about some of these people.
Talking about Abdul Ghafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job in reviving the traditional disease of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of bringing this rare art to a new generation.
I conveyed my best wishes to former US President Barak Obama on the artwork of the tree of life built by Abdul Ghafoor.
In receiving the Padma awards, Shabbid Syed of Marathwad is known as the servant of Mother cow.
The way he has entrusted his entire life to the service of the mother cow, it is unique in itself.
You will be happy to hear about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America and Lynch has become a living organisation of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he has trained people from all over the world in Yoga and till now he has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Tarzon in Jharkhand, did adventure to face Timber's mafia and cruelty who not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also motivated tens of thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to illustrate the work done by them for the upliftment of Divyang women, even though they are disabled, and they are working relentlessly to make the blind children self-reliant by establishing an institution called Pragyachakshu Mahila Sevakunj.
He cited an example of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from their area to join the Self Help Groups to become economically vibrant.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to talk about the experience that has touched the hearts of all those who have been feeling for the last few days.
Nowadays, wherever I go to the country, I have been trying to reach out to some beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how a big change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
If all of you know the poor person who is not able to get treatment without money, tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every such poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for examination in schools is going to start.
Different educational boards across the country will launch operations for the 10th and 12th standard board examinations in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the students, their daughters and all the teachers of the examination.
A few days ago, a very big event was held in Delhi in the form of a Townhole.
The unique feature of the Exam Discussion Programme was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination today.
Some aspects have come up which can definitely be beneficial for the students.
All the students can see the entire programme on their parents and teachers on YouTube and wish all the warriors of my examinations for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, be it a matter of India or not of festivals
It will not be in our country for a day which does not have any significance, which has no festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Maha Shivratri will be celebrated and this time Shivratri will be held on Mondays and when Shivratri is on Mondays, a special significance of it will be felt in our temples.
My best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I had gone to Kashi where I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
He said that I am a Prime Minister.
I was really impressed with the power of the Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, I meet crores of families every month through radio.
Sometimes, while talking to you people, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on the phone, I feel like giving me a part of my family.
This is a very pleasant experience for me.
Friends, the election is a very big celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in all the election races.
And I would have been talking to you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, the country received a sad news.
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - i. e.
His fame was a scholar who had a strange stance on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He put his whole life behind the goal of providing food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
The welfare of the farmers in every way was the priority of Swamiji's life.
Siddhganga Math used to organize animal and agricultural fairs regularly.
I have had the privilege of getting the blessings of the supreme venerable Swami ji several times.
Kalam Saheb had written a poem on this occasion for the revered Swamiji.
This poem by Dr. Kalam Saheb reflects the life of Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is not only an integral part of our democracy but is also older than our democracy. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
There is no way left in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that a polling station is also set up in Himachal Pradesh with a height of 15,000 feet above sea level, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands also have remote islands.
Only one voter
When we hear these things then it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
Keeping in mind a voter, it provides an opportunity to the voters to use the voter to vote, so that the entire team of Election Commission employees goes to the remote areas and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its sustained efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to take responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to become part of the decision-making process in the country.
It is time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
Each one of us must feel that becoming a voter in the country, achieving the right to vote, is one of the important achievements of life.
Together, it is my duty to vote - this feeling should persist in us.
There should be a lot of pain if there is no reason in life, if it is not possible to vote.
If there is something wrong in the country then it should be sad.
I appeal to the renowned celebrities of the country to collectively raise awareness among the people about the registration of voters or voting on the day of polling.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some amazing work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his Jayanti with a different style.
On the occasion of Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that many rooms and buildings have been closed since independence in the Red Fort.
The closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into a very beautiful museum, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army, the museum dedicated to 'Yad-e-Jaliyan' and 185-Indias first freedom struggle, and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as 'Kranti Mandir'.
Each brick of these museums has the aroma of our glorious history.
The tale of our freedom struggle at the core of the museum inspires us to enter into history.
At this place, the British ruled over the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort, the family members of Netaji gave me a very special cap.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
I have played the cap in the museum so that people visiting the museum can also see the cap and inspire patriotism from it.
In fact, the patriotism and patriotism of our heroes need to be constantly conveyed to the new generation.
Just a month ago, on 30th December, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In one programme, Tirango had flown exactly where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had flown Tirango five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was thrown at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion of the completion of five years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizer.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with vibrant friends like 'Delhi Chalo', 'Tum Muze Khan Do, 'My Tumh Freedom Dunga'.
For many years I had been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am glad that we have been able to do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we did a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to call you a case related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting people, just like Netaji had a close relationship with radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and through radio he interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and with the people of the country.
I was told that the radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins which used to live in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangladesh, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station is being operated by a resident of Gujarat M.
Vyas Ji played a very important role.
Programmes being broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual museum has also been built in this revolutionary temple.
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and artworks of the three centuries old.
The museum exhibits excellent works of great artists like Amrit Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Seloz Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge you all to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that things are happening here and I am talking about the excellent work of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has painted a number of themes.
He has also made pictures of animals and birds, he has painted many beautiful scenes, and later he has also worked to bring human characters to the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his works.
He believed that those who saw their pictures themselves should understand the pictures and see the messages given by them in the pictures from their point of view.
Their pictures are also exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely see their pictures in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
There was one such saint - Saint Ravidas.
1st February is the birth anniversary of Ravidas.
The Doha of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Saint Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime through his message.
It would not be wrong to say that they have made the world a true meaning of labour.
He used to say: 'Man Changa Kathauti Me Ganga' means if your heart and mind are sacred, Sakshat Deva resides in your hearts.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of every level, every class, be it the queen of Chittor or the queen of Meerabai, all of them followed him.
Once again I salute Saint Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidre has written on MyGov that I have highlighted Indias space programme and its future aspects.
He also wanted me to urge the students to take part in the space programme and think about going beyond the sky - Kiranji, I appreciate this idea of yours and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
It has been launched on 24th January, the Kalam-Set created by our scholars.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made many records.
Since independence, almost as many space missions have been launched in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
We will soon recall Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan 2 mission.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way to protect the lives of people.
Whether it is air-warfare or rail or road safety, space technology has been providing a lot of support.
Our fishermen brothers and sisters have been divided into Navic Devices which are helpful in their safety and economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
Approximately 40 lakh households of 23 States have been generated under this scheme.
Besides, under MGNREGA, nearly three and a half crore assets have also been tagged.
Our satellites are a symbol of the growing power of the country today.
It contributes immensely to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative that has given a gift of development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our limited competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme provides opportunities for children to think big and move beyond the boundaries that have been considered impossible so far.
It is a vision for our children to keep watching stars and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whoever plays will be dissolved and this time many youngsters and sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India.
In January, about 6,000 players participated in 18 games at India Youth Games in Pune.
Only when the player performs well at the local level will he perform well at the global level.
This time players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is a tremendous inspiration.
In Muktabaji, young player Akash Gorkha won a silver medal and I was reading that Akash's father Ramesh Ji works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Helvi Satara, the captain of the 21 women Kabdadi team of Maharashtra, is residing.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali's hunter.
It is often seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
However, Sonali chose Kabbaddi and performed excellently.
The ten year old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswani, daughter of a farmer in Karnataka, won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is the resolve of Youth Power that is New India.
These stories from Khelo India show that the people of not only big cities are contributing to the creation of a New India, but people from small towns and villages are also a big contributor to youngsters, youngsters and talent.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the prestigious beauty competition.
But have you heard about the competition to shine the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in a unique competition that has been going on for the last one month.
This unique competition is called Swachh Sundar Shauchalay.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, people are also making some pictures by making them colorful and beautiful and you will also see several pictures of a clean toilet from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
Definitely share your clean beautiful toilet picture with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, we started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
Today, with the cooperation of the people of India, India is moving ahead to become Open Defecation Free long before 2nd October 2017 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the audience of Mann Ki Baat has also contributed immensely. And that is why I am happy with you all that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and six hundred districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and have crossed 8 in rural India and toilets have been provided to nearly nine crore families.
My young friends, the days of examinations will come.
Akhul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about the warriors of examinations and exams.
Anchuthor ji, thank you for taking up this issue.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the period of examination.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are busy in exams.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat programme, but you will be happy to know that I will interact with students from all over the country at 11.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
In this Exam Dialogue, I will talk to my young friends about all aspects related to examinations, especially the stress-free exams.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas for this thing and I am very happy that a large number of people are putting their thoughts on MyGov.
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall programme.
You must be part of this program...
You will also be able to see its lively spread through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
The entire nation pays homage to the martyrs at 11 o'clock.
We must pay homage to the martyrs wherever we may be.
Remember the venerable Bapu and to fulfill the dreams of revered Bapu, to build a New India, to fulfil our duties as citizens. Let us move forward with this resolve.
May this visit be successfully carried forward.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can transform our lives and together contribute to furthering the nation and society
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of 2019.
You must have thought about how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to recall how India will remember 2019 as a country, its potential as a 100 crore people.
It makes all of us proud.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the worlds largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's renowned institutions have acknowledged that India is making the country free from poverty.
With the resolve of the countrymen, cleanliness coverage has increased to 5.
For the first time since independence from the Red Fort, for the first time on the 75th anniversary of the independence of India, the tricolor was laid.
The country got the Statue of Unity, the world's highest statue in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who celebrated the country in the spirit of unity.
The name of the country was elevated in the world.
The country was honoured with the UN's highest environmental award Champions of the Earth Award.
Indias efforts in solar energy and climate change have been ranked globally.
The country's security has got a new strength.
This year our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad so now we have become a nuclear powerhouse in water, space and navel three.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by touring the world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The country's longest rail-road pool bogibeel bridge was dedicated to the nation before Sikkim and the country's Soma Airport - Pakyong was inaugurated.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
However, if I continue to talk about the human rights of every Indian, our collective efforts, our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that this journey of Indias progress and progress will continue in 2017 and our country will be able to scale new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some extraordinary countrymen in December.
Dr. Jaychandran was known for providing affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that they were always ready for the treatment of the patient.
He used to pay rent to the elderly patients coming for treatment.
I am the beterindia.
They have read about many such works that inspire the society on the Com website.
Similarly, the execution of Sulagitti Narsamma of Karnataka was reported on 25th December.
Sulagitti Narsamma was a helper to help pregnant mothers and sisters in delivery.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was honored with Padmashree.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jaychandran and Sulagitti Narsamma who dedicated their lives for the betterment of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to discuss the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past few days some of our party workers have told me that some young doctors in the city are implanting camps and treating the poor free of cost.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors and friends associated with selfless service is truly praiseworthy.
Today, I am going to say this thing very proudly that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
We got to read about Jaychandran and whenever we get the opportunity, we have got the thebeterindia.
I have been trying to know such inspiring things by going to the com.
I am glad that today there are several websites that are familiar with many stories that inspire people from their lives.
Like thepositiveindia.
Com is working to spread positiveness in the society and make the society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who bring about change in society.
It is easy to spread negativeness but many good things are happening around us in the society and it is happening through the collective efforts of all 130 crore Indians.
Sports plays an important role in every society.
When sports are played, the minds of the observers also get filled with energy.
We are experiencing a lot of experience in the name, identity and dignity of the players.
But sometimes there are many things behind it which are even bigger than sports.
I would like to talk about Hanaya Visar, a daughter of Kashmir who has won gold medals at Karate Championships in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnagar in Kashmir.
Hanaya studied hard work and related matters and proved herself by making a slightest vision.
My best wishes to all my countrymen for a bright future.
My best wishes and blessings to Hannaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a daughter-in-law of 16 years.
You must have read.
Rajni has won Gold in Junior Womens Muktabaji Competition.
After winning the medal, go to a milk stall and drink a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni put his medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You are wondering why should Rajni drink a glass of milk 
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji, who sells lassi on a stall of water.
Rajni said that her father has made a lot of sacrifice in bringing her here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work daily in the morning and his brothers and sisters.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing in front of his father, his father encouraged him to get all possible assistance.
Rajini had to start a booking exercise with old age as the financial condition of his family was not good at that time.
Despite all this, the courage of serving remained unsuccessful and learnt boxing.
It has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini.
And also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh and Usharani Ji for supporting her and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni Cycle, has become the fastest Asian tourist in the world.
It used to run around 300 km of cycle daily for 15 days.
Do we not get inspiration from knowing this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents, we also get inspired to do something in the midst of difficulties.
If the resolution is capable and zealous, then the obstacles automatically disappear.
Problems can never be interrupted.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration in our lives every moment.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals full of fervor and enthusiasm in January like Lohadi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi
During this time, Surya enters the Makar Rasi after landing.
After this day, the day gradually starts to grow and the winter crops start harvesting.
My best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
The spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is enshrined in our festivals.
We can see how our festivals and festivals are linked to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered different, but individuals and worlds are the same.
Our close relationship with nature is a good example, a lander based on festivals.
Festivals are also a list of grasslands.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and geographical events is.
Festivals and festivals are determined according to the moon and the sun calendar based on the moon and sunset.
It depends on who the calendar believes.
Festivals are also celebrated in accordance with the status of planetary constellations in many areas.
Gudi Pawa, Chetichand, Ugadi are celebrated as per the lunar calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu - all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the Sun Calendar.
Rivers and water conservation is particularly inherent in many of our festivals.
Chhath Parv - Rivers and ponds are connected to the sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people drown in sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On the one hand it has an ancient significance, on the other hand, every festival is taught with great ease to live with each other.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on 2017 and wish you a lot of joy for the upcoming festivals.
Share the pictures taken on these festivals with everyone to see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of things in our culture that we can take pride in and we can show the entire world with pride and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Even in films, we must have seen a lot about its magnificence and enormousness and it must be true that the form of Kumbh is vast - as divine as it is.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a crowd of faith and faith.
Millions of people from all over the country are connected at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is blessed with our great cultural heritage.
The world famous Kumbh Convention to be held in Prayagraj on January 15 this year, perhaps all of you are eagerly waiting.
For the Kumbh Mela, the syllabus of Saints and Mahatmas has already started.
Its global significance can be estimated from the fact that last year UNESCO has identified the Kumbh Congregation in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, ambassadors from many countries witnessed the preparations for the Kumbh, and at the same time the national flag of many countries was hoisted.
More than 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
With the divinity of Kumbh, Indias magnificence will spread its colour all over the world.
This can be a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are in full swing.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for the Kumbh.
I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre there and the devotees will be able to get a lot of help in it.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If there will be cleanliness along with faith in the event then a good message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotee will also be able to pay homage to Akshayvad after a sacred bath at the confluence.
This Akshayvad, the symbol of the people's faith, was shut in the fort for hundreds of years, the devotees who could not see it.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
I appeal to all of you that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep the photos and photos of the Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspired to go to Kumbh.
May the Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh be a Kumbh of nationalism as well.
May this Kumbh of devotees also become a mega festival of national unity and may this Kumbh become a mega festival of world tourists.
May this Kumbh of artistic artistry also become a megacum of creative powers.
Poojay Bapu and South Africa have a very close relationship.
It was South Africa where Mohan became Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly against apartheid.
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, which brought peace and justice across the globe.
Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as the birth centenary year of Mandela, also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of anti-radical struggle all over the world and who was inspired by Mandela
He had got the patience and inspiration of spending so many years in jail from the venerable Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals also inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, a DGP conference was held in Kevadia, where the world's highest statue is Statue of Unity, there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
There was an extensive discussion on how to take steps to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
During this period, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Awards for National Unity which will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that Indias strength lies in its diversity.
We pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of unity, respecting that spirit.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, Guru Gobind Singh ji is a sacred festival.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his workplace remained in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace in Patna, the workplace in North India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has received their blessings.
If they want their lives then they get the glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had secured the post of Guru at a young age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was a calm and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, he was wronged then Guru Gobind Singh ji strongly condemned his voice for the poor and the weak.
He said that strength cannot be demonstrated by fighting with weaker sections of the society.
Shri Gobind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human suffering.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice and religion, who had an universal knowledge of both arms and science.
He was not only an antagonist but also a scholar of many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, Food Safety and Standard Authorisation of India is happening.
Several programmes are being organized across the country to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
F.
Under the Eat Right India campaign, healthy India journeys are going on across the country.
The drive will continue till January 2nd.
When India will be clean and healthy, India will also be prosperous.
The most important thing for good health is nutritious food.
You should also participate in it and especially I urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last edition of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, we will talk about Mann Ki Baat, be it the life of the individual, the life of the nation, the lives of the society, the inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let us move ahead with new inspiration, new zeal, new resolve, new achievements, new heights, let us move forward, change ourselves, change the country too.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October, 2014, the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started our journey together.
Today, 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat have been completed.
Similarly, today this Golden Jubilee Episode is the Golden Jubilee Episode.
The letters and phones that you have received this time are mostly in the context of this 50th episode.
On May Gov, Vikas Yadav from Anchukumur, Amarkumar and Patna, similarly on Narendra Modi App, Monica Jain of Delhi, Burdwan, Prasenjit Sarkar of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have asked about the same question.
They say that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile app, but why did you choose a radio to connect with the people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era when the radio was forgotten, why did Modi bring the radio
I was nine months old and I was going to some other place in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal it gets cold in the evening, then stay on the way for tea in a dhaba and when I gave orders for tea then before that it was a very small dhaba, only one person used to make tea, used to sell it.
There was no cloth on it.
M was standing on the bank of the rod with a small lari.
He said, No, Saheb, you don't know, it's a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand, he said, look, listen to Sahib radio, there was talk about it on the radio.
The reach and depth of communication cannot be done properly with the radio.
In my mind, this thing has been done since that time and I got an idea of its strength.
When I became the Prime Minister then it was very natural for me to pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I took charge as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I wanted that the unity of the country, our glorious history, its valour, the diversity of India, the serpents of our society, the strength, fury, sacrifice and penance of the people, all these things should be conveyed to the people of India.
From far-flung villages of the country to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals.
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these possibilities that are very interesting.
Of the people surveyed, an average of 90 are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it increases the spirit of positiveness in the society.
Mann Ki Baat has given a big boost to peoples movements.
There has also been widespread discussion on indiapositiveness.
It is also a glimpse of the spirit of positiveness and the spirit of positiveness in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has increased the spirit of volunteering that is self-sufficiency.
Along with radio, mobile, internet, Facebook Lives and Pariscopy, Narendra Modi is also connected to Mann Ki Baat through App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for their trust and becoming a part of it.
Your fear is correct.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and millions and millions of dollars are to be heard then what should be the need
Some young friends studied all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, analyzing the words of all episodes, performing lexical analysis and studying what words were spoken.
Which words have been spoken repeatedly.
One of his concepts is that this programme has been unpopular.
When Mann Ki Baat was started then I had decided that there should be no politics in it, neither should there be praise of the government in it, nor should there be Modi in it, and the biggest strength and greatest inspiration to fulfil my resolution was given to you.
Modi will come and go, but this country will be at stake, our culture will be immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
It will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
The strength of a government will be such that the zeal of selfievithdaughter starts from a small village in Haryana and spreads not only across the country but also abroad.
All sections of society, celebrities, all should be connected and in a new, modern language of thinking in the society, which todays generation understands.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat also enjoys fun, but in my mind, 130 crore Indians live.
My thoughts are with him.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government - it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
India's original life is not politics, India's original life is not political.
India's root cause is social policy and societal power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one aspect is politics.
It is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes political events and politicians dominate so much that other talents and other elements of the society are suppressed.
Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction. It is the collective responsibility of all of us to get the rightful place for the bright future of a country like India.
Your question in a way is a question of self-interest.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are asking questions not to the elderly Prime Minister but to one of your closest friends.
If you answer the questions that you have asked, if you answer them directly then you will say nothing.
Indeed, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple thing for me.
Every time there are letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
On MyGov and NarendraModi mobile app, people say their thoughts, there is also a toll free number - 1800 11800.
People also record their messages in their voices by calling them there.
When the episode of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read very closely the thoughts and information that you have sent during your visit.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I would like to mention some facts such as the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
If you ask the truth, I have heard a voice in Mann Ki Baat, but for example, emotions and emotions belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet been able to name in Mann Ki Baat but they keep sending their letters and comments without being disappointed. Your thoughts and feelings are very important in my life.
I am confident that I will have multiple more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
It has also been tried to keep in mind the letters and suggestions not included in Mann Ki Baat.
With his hard work Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
Akashwani team prepares every episode to be broadcasted in many languages.
Some people efficiently speak Mann Ki Baat in the voice that Modi has received in regional languages and in the same tone.
Thus, he becomes Narendra Modi only for 30 minutes.
I also congratulate them for their talent and skills.
I would urge all of you to listen to this programme in your local languages as well.
I would like to heartily congratulate my friends of the media who regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Any politician is never happy with the media, he feels that he gets very little coverage or the coverage he receives is negative, but the media has made several topics in Mann Ki Baat.
There are several topics like cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with the doctor whom the media has innovatively worked to take forward.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat remains incomplete without your cooperation.
In fact, I have no secret.
Whatever I am doing will happen to all the families as well.
In a simple language, I try to put myself in the youth, I try to keep myself in that condition and make a collective arrangement with the ideas and ideas of the youth.
It is an old baggage of our lives, when it is not there, it becomes easy to understand anyone.
Today's youngsters are very much pleased that they will not do anything that they do not believe in themselves and when they believe in something then they leave everything behind for it.
Many times people talk about the Communication Gap between the elderly and the elderly in their families.
In fact, interaction with swimmers in most families is very limited.
In most of the times, there is a crisis in terms of reading or walking or lifestyle, not doing so. Without any expectation, the talk of open mind has gradually started decreasing among the families and it is also a matter of concern.
Discussion instead of accepting and dismissing expect will make the dialogue impressive.
My efforts are being made to continuously interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or what they are thinking.
They always have Idea stores.
They are very energyful, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts and ideas of the youth as much as possible.
There are frequent complaints that youngsters ask a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that young people ask questions.
This is because it means that they want to examine everything from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience among the youth but I believe that there is no time for the youth to wipe out the same thing that helps the youth to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that todays youth are very ambitious and they think a lot of big things.
It is good to have big dreams and achieve great successes.
After all, this is the New India.
Some people say that the young generation wants to do many things at the same time.
What am I saying is wrong
They are perfect in multitasking, so they do so.
If we look around, it is the youth who bring about a big change in the social interaction or start-ups, sports or any other field-society.
Those youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and dream big.
If we take the thoughts of the youth to the ground and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring about positive change in the country, they are also doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineetaji has written on May Gov that in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
They say that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vineetaji, thank you very much for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
It is a day to recall the great scholars who created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1947.
The Constituent Assembly took 21 months and 1 days to complete this historic task of building the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years these great personalities have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace with which he built the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the great talents of the country, each one of them was committed to giving such a constitution to the country so that the people of India become strong and the poorest of the poor also become capable.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties, i.e. rights and duties, have been described in detail.
The coordination between these two will take the country forward in the lives of citizens.
If we respect the rights of others, it will protect our rights. And in this way, if we follow our duties given in the Constitution, it will also protect our rights.
I still remember that when 60 years of Indias democracy was completed in 2010, in Gujarat, we took out the visionary journey of the Constitution by placing it on an elephant.
It was a memorable occasion for the youth to raise awareness about the Constitution and connect them with the passages of the Constitution.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years and we will complete 5 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all pursue the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, talking about the Constituent Assembly can never forget the contribution of a great man who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
I salute Babasaheb on behalf of all the countrymen who have given the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say - Indias democratic values have not come from outside.
What is a democracy and what is a parliamentary system, it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect the freedom that has come after such a struggle till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be of different backgrounds, but we have to keep the national interest on all things.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on 23rd November we all celebrate the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Guru at that time when I was holding a meeting related to it.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara suffered a lot, but the way the state government together with the local people revived it is still an example today.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to construct Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit that holy place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan, Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, after 50 episodes, we will meet once again, in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I have got the opportunity to place the emotions behind this programme of Mann Ki Baat before you because you people have asked such questions, but our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the more our journey will become deeper and more satisfying.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I would like to say that one thing touches my heart in the image of Mann Ki Baat, while most people have said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat by sitting with all the family, it seems that the elders of our family are sharing our own thoughts with us.
When I heard this thing in a detailed manner, I was very satisfied that I am amongst you and in a way I would continue to come here again and again as a member of your family through Mann Ki Baat.
Your aspirations, my ambitions.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before independence, on January 24, there was a footprint of Sardar Patel on the world's famous International Magazine, the version of Time Magazine, which was published.
In his main story, he had printed a map of India and it was not a map that we wanted today.
It was the map of India shared in many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that India was facing threats like violence, food crisis, inflation and power politics.
Time Magazine further states that it is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel who has the ability to unite the country and fill the zodiac.
How he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha.
His authenticity and commitment to the country was such that all the farmers, from laborers to industrialists used to rely on him.
Whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad or Travancore or Rajwada of Rajasthan, it is Sardar Patel who can see an India today with swelling and strategic skills.
We naturally bow down to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on seeing this nation and Mother India bound by unity.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special. On this day, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is twice the US State of Liberty.
It is the world's highest statue of Gaganchhubi.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the highest statue in the world is on the soil of India.
The land that Sardar Patel had associated with, will now increase the size of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why all the citizens of India think of this Infantry Day
This is the day when the Indian Army had landed on the soil of Kashmir and had protected the valley from the fury.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old Interview of Samanakshaw, who was a great military officer of India.
He was remembering Field Marshal Manekshaw at the Interview when he was a Colonel.
During this period, in October 14, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said that during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had resigned for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir and during his meeting, he looked at him in his special estimate and said that there should be no delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and as soon as possible, it should be resolved quickly.
After that, the army personnel flew into the Kashmir-based airplane and we saw how the army was successful.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji is also a sacred leader.
The Prime Minister also paid homage to Dr.
My dear countrymen, who do not like sports
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Our para athletes of the Asian Para Games 2018 held earlier in Jakarta got the opportunity to meet.
In these sports, India won a total of 2 medals and made a new record and enhanced Indias pride.
I had the privilege of personally meeting with all these talented para athletes and congratulated them.
Similarly, the awardees of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youth have performed the best ever in the Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, apart from 13 moonlights, we also received three other moonlights in mix events.
You might remember that this time Indias performance in Asian sports was also excellent.
See, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best, the most grand words ever so far.
This is the story of todays Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those fields which it never thought about.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who has won gold medals in athletics for the country in 2018 Asian Para Games.
It is Divyang since birth.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a driver in Dhaba to clean the DTC buses and to drive the roadside in Delhi.
Today, the same Narayan International events have been winning gold medals for India.
Moreover, look at the growing spirit of excellence in Indias sports, India has never won any Olympic Medal in Judo, be it Senior Level or Junior Level.
But Tababi Devi created history by winning a silver medal in the Judas at Youth Olympics.
16-year-old young player Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father is a labourer when his mother works to sell fish.
There were times before his family when he did not even have the money to eat.
Even in such circumstances, Tababi Devi's courage will not be overwhelmed.
And he created history of winning medals for the country.
There are countless stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you would be reminded that we had successfully organized the FIFA Under 1 World Cup in 2017.
The whole world also appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
FIFA UNDER 1 World Cup had also created a new record about the number of visitors.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and enhanced the courage of young players.
This year, India has been fortunate to host the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian must have an interest in hockey in any sports or game.
India has a golden history in hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in many competitions and has also been a world cup winner.
India has also given hockey many great sportspersons.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world is familiar with Dhyan Chand, the architect of Hockey.
Thereafter, from Balinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai, Hockey has cut a huge joke.
Even today, Team India players are inspiring a new generation of hockey because of their hard work and achievements.
There is a good opportunity to see thrilling matches for sports lovers.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing in their support and I also convey my best wishes to all the teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming volunteers, they are inspiring for all the countrymen.
But in a new era, new generation, new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward to do these things.
Every Indian will be proud to see the zeal and zeal for this work.
It is an aroma of a journey from youth to society, not a man, not a young man, from self to the world.
Somebody is teaching children and somebody is teaching the elderly.
If someone is involved in cleanliness then someone is helping the farmers and there is no redness behind doing that but there is a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man learned a wheelchair basketball to help the Divyangjan's wheelchair basketball team.
This is the dedication that is the thrust of the mission.
Will no Indian be proud of this
This spirit of 'Main Nahin Hum' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was looking at your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I saw a very interesting stamp of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov: Please talk about how the customs and traditions of the tribes of India are a great example of coexistence with nature.
For sustainable development, we need to learn from them how to adopt their traditions in our lives.
I compliment you for keeping this topic among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a topic that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture, today the whole world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle, Balanced Life.
However, our India year is not free from this problem, but for its sake, we just have to do something inside us, see our rich history and traditions, and especially understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature is a part of the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship the trees and the flowers like gods and goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, especially among the Bhil tribes of Middle India, worship the trees like peepal and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
Especially in the context of conservation of trees, they are allowed to sacrifice their lives, but they are not allowed to damage a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
He regards them as his brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland also tigers are seen as protectors of forests.
In Maharashtra, the people of the Barli community consider the tiger as a guest and the presence of tigers is a source of prosperity for them.
In central India, the Coal community believes that their own destiny is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not get food then the village will also have to be hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the river Kathan during the summit season.
They consider these areas as the shelter of fish, which is why they get healthy and abundant fish.
Adivasi community makes their homes natural, strong and environment friendly.
In the solitary areas of the Nilgiri plateau of South India, a small dispersed tribe is traditionally composed of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a fact that the tribal community believes in living with a very peaceful and mutually beneficial fair but when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against British rule for the protection of his forest land
There are many examples of the tribal community that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and today the country is the debt of our tribals to save the wealth of forests.
Let us express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing extraordinary work for society.
The first thing that appears to be ordinary is that in reality, there is a deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
A common and hardworking farmer was the daughter of Gurubachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry with ease.
Whether it is life or other things, no expense needs to be spent.
Some things may be difficult for the girl's family but you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, the condition that he said by making a payment is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you should promise me that now you will not burn the fruits in the field.
You can imagine how big social power is there in it.
Gurubachan Singh ji is very fond of this thing but it shows how vast his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform personal events into social interests.
One such example has been presented to us by the family of Shri Gurubachan Singh.
I have read about another village of Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You all are moving forward as a true heir to the Indian heritage of healthy lifestyle.
Likewise, small awareness and activeness and positive action play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our texts:- , . . :: : You mean, O God, there is peace in all three worlds, in water, in the sky, in space, in fire, in wind, in medicines, in plantations, in environment, in unconsciousness, in the entire universe.
Peace be upon me, in the heart, in the stars, in the particles of the world.
India has special significance for 11th November this year because the first world war ended on 11th November 100 years ago, it is completing 100 years of its conclusion, i. e.
The First World War for India was an important event.
In the true sense, we would not have taken any direct action against that war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and sacrificed the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their bravery in difficult areas and even in odd circumstances.
It was the only objective behind everyone - the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world witnessed a destruction drive.
According to estimates, nearly 1 crore soldiers and almost the same citizens lost their lives.
It understood the importance of peace all over the world.
In the last 100 years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony are not meant to be a war.
From terrorism to transformation, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our hope is a matter of India.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people there are very talented.
Our humble India is now known for its best practices.
Ishaan Bharat is an area that has made immense progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that the awards given for the best policy formulation in this field are similar to the Oscars in the field.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by leaving behind 51 nominated policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is going to end.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens.
I would urge you all to take care of yourself, take care of your health and take care of the interests of the society.
May this festival be an opportunity in your life to move forward as a mission and take a solemn pledge.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The progress made by you people will be the progress of the country.
My best wishes to all of you.
