Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Deepajyotirnamostte
I bow down to such divine visions.
What could be a better idea to remember Deepawali than to spread light everywhere, to spread positiveness and to destroy the feeling of hostility
Today, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community participates in it but now the governments of many countries, their citizens and their social organizations celebrate Diwali with full fervor.
In a way they realize India.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world itself was attractive.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has immense potential for festival tourism.
Be it Holi or Diwali or Onam or be it Pongal or be it Bihu, our efforts should be made to involve the people of other states and other countries in the joy of festivals.
We have so many festivals in every state and in every region that people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in increasing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different.
I had said - let all of us celebrate this Diwali, the women power of India, and the noble success that they have achieved, that is, the honor of Laxmi of India
And soon after this, innumerable inspirational stories began to emerge in the social media.
Ramesh wrote on Namo App in Warangal that my mother is my power.
When my children died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today, we have five brothers in good business.
Ramesh ji, my greetings to our mothers
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him Major Khushboo is India's Laxmi who is a bus driver and led all the women teams of Assam Rifles.
For poet Tawari ji and Laxmi of India is his daughter, which is also his strength.
They are proud that their daughters do good paintings.
He has also achieved a very good category in the CLAT examination.
Megha Jain has written that an old woman of 92 years of age provides free water to travellers at the Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Laxmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by the people.
You must take inspiration and do something like that in your own surroundings.
I salute all these Lakshadweeps of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous poetess of the 17th century Sanchi Honamma had written a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The words that we are not talking about every Laxmi of India, the foundation of it was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how beautiful spirit and how excellent ideas are there in these poems of Kannada.
Our daughters, these are our pride and the glory of these daughters is a strong identity of our society and the future is bright.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
The influence of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tehran Gurudwara.
There is a lot that I can tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Devji but for that many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be required.
He always kept the spirit of service at the top.
Guru Nanak Devji believes that there cannot be any value for the selfless service.
He stood firmly against social evils like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji conveyed his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most commuters of our time.
He went to many places and won the hearts of all through his simple nature, humility and simplicity wherever he went.
Guru Nanak Devji undertook several important religious voyages, which were called sadness.
Taking the message of goodwill and equality, whether it is north or south or east or west, everywhere people, saints and sages met.
It is believed that the famous Saint Shankar Dev of Assam had also taken inspiration from him.
He travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji who constantly reminds us of it.
During a depression, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him Guru.
They are venerable in Uzbekistan, where they went.
During one of his delusions, he had also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They settled in the minds of millions of people who followed their teachings and are still doing so.
Just a few days ago, the ambassadors of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and this event marked the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these messengers not only visited the Golden Temple but also got the opportunity to know about the tradition and culture.
Thereafter, several envoys posted photographs on social media and wrote glorious about good experiences.
I wish that the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will inspire us to bring his ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I believe that the date of 31st October will certainly be remembered by all of you.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was a great leader to listen to the country.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a unique ability to bring people together, on the other hand, he used to integrate with those who had ideological differences.
Sardar Patel used to look at small things very deeply and take a look at them.
In the true sense, he was the Man of Details who insisted on the pen.
At the same time, he was a master of organisational skills.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country will participate in the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the systems of the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
It was decided that no one would have any shortage of water.
Moreover, he was observed to visit a delegate's luggage or pair of shoes at the convention site and you will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel had done this thing.
He urged the farmers to make Khadi pipelines.
The farmers have made pisses and sold to the delegates.
Wearing our shoes in these pigeons and keeping those pigeons with us, the tension in the minds of the representatives came to an end.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a remarkable role in the Constitution.
They did a very important job in deciding basic rights, so that there was no distinction between caste and sect.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a very great work of uniting the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai had the same speciality that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, there were discussions about certain regions in the integration of the country.
He told Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxmanaswamy Mudaliar that they should take the people of Travancore and travel there immediately and tri-color there should be a first tricolor in Lakshadweep.
The tricolor was fluttered immediately after his orders and the neighbouring country's neighbourhood to capture Lakshadweep was ruined.
After the incident, Sardar Patel tied up his mind to personally assure that Lakshadweep would get all necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, a statue of unity was dedicated to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
It has twice the height of the statue of the freedom fighter of the United States.
The tallest statue in the world makes every Indian proud.
Every Indian is respected by the princes.
You will be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the statue of unity.
This means that everyday 8,500 people will see the magnificence of the statue of unity.
He expressed his heartfelt devotion to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are several attraction centres of attraction such as Select Garden, Phulpakhu Park, Jungle Safari, Poshan Bhawan Park for children, Ekta Nursery etc. are continuously developing and the local economy is getting a boost and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming here, the people of many villages are providing such facilities in their homes and homesteads.
Business training is also being provided to those who provide homeless amenities at home.
I am sure that the people there have started the farming of dragon fruits and will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, the effigy of unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witnesses to how a place was developed in a year as a world famous tourist destination.
People from India and abroad come there.
Several systems like transportation, obstacles, guides, environmental supplementation are being developed one after another.
There is a huge economic disruption and people are facilitating it as per the requirements of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month, the effigy of unity among the 100 most important tourist destinations of the world has been placed at the forefront.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of your precious time to see the statue of unity.
However, I urge that every Indian who takes out his travel time should travel to at least 15 tourist places in India along with his family and wherever he goes, wherever he goes, he will continue to stay in the night.
Friends, As we know, 31st October is celebrated as National Unity Day every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country by paying us any price.
On 31st October, every year, Run for Unity is being organized.
This will be attended by people from all walks of life, from every section of society.
Run for Unity is a reflection of the fact that this country is one, moving in one direction and achieving a goal.
However, nowadays, there is a verse and verse about marathon in people.
The Run for Unity is also a provision for the same pace.
We have also been associated with Fit India and also with Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And because of this, not only the body but also the mind and the culture have to move towards Indias unity, to take India to new heights.
You can get information about the Run for Unity around you in the city where you live.
In this portal, the locations where the Run for Unity will be organised across the country have been informed.
All of us will certainly run on 31st October - for the unity of India, for the sake of our own good.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has made the country united.
This mantra of unity is like a value in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every level, at every juncture, at every juncture, at every juncture in the country full of diversity like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and conscientious to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010 when the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember that day, what was the atmosphere
How many people had come to the ground
How the interest groups were playing to take advantage of the situation.
What kind of language was used to fever the environment .
Attempts were also made to fill in different voices.
On the one hand, there were two weeks of atmosphere for fever but when the result came to an end in the Ram Janmabhoomi then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and sages gave a very moderate response.
Efforts to reduce stress in the environment.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is an example of how unity gives strength to the country.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31st October.
I pay my homage to the nation today.
My dear countrymen, today you can hear a story from every household far away, you can hear a tale from every village, from north to south, east to west, every corner of India that is about cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village feels happy about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
125 crore Indians are the owners of their results.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I have heard that I am thinking, let us also tell you.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature ranges from 50 to 60 degrees.
The air is called life-saving.
Even in such a difficult situation, it is not less than a bravery.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but they are also running the Clean Siachen Campaign.
I compliment the people of our country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that even some disruptions are difficult.
In such a scenario, segregation and management of waste is an important task.
In such a scenario, 130 tons of waste from glaciers and surrounding areas and how big it is in such a delicate environment
We all know that Siachen is such a part that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in lower areas and also using water from rivers like Nubra and Shyak.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a new ecstasy in all our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, something or the other is being bought from the market.
The more we try to purchase local goods, the greater the 150 Gandhi will become.
And I would like to urge you to buy something that was made by our weavers and the hands of our Khadiwala.
In this Diwali too, we must have purchased a lot before Diwali.
However, there would be a lot of people who would be thinking that if they go after Diwali then they would get a little cheaper.
There would have been a lot of people whose purchases would have been there.
While congratulating Deepawali, I would like to urge you to purchase local goods.
See how important the dream of Mahatma Gandhi can be played.
But sometimes there is a fire that remains unconscious.
There were wounds somewhere.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, be it any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is ever ready to express his joy and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recalled the mission-breaking attacks in 2016, when our soldiers reacted sufficiently to those who fought against terrorism.
In different parts of the country, your armed forces have exhibited exhibitions so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, can understand their strengths.
We can understand how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives behind us.
Like the Parakram Parv, I remind the youth of the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces and inspire us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and we are committed to encouraging it but it is not at all wrong with dignity and the value of the sovereignty of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a bravery of our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries that send more and more troops to the United Nations fast-paced peacekeeping forces.
For decades, our soldiers have played an important role in promoting peace across the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the aspirations of the people in the Republic Day programme is the Fly Paste in which our Air Force exhibits its capabilities by exhibiting leopard wireless air.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served the nation.
In 1947, when the Pakistani aggressor launched an indirect strike, the air force itself ensured that Indian soldiers and materials would reach the battlefield on time to defend Srinagar.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who knows the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from smuggling in 1999.
On Tiger Hill, the air force dumped the enemy by showering a bomb at night.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable achievements of these brave air warriors.
His work of combating natural calamities from floods, floods to forest fires is amazing.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring male and female equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of our departments for the girls.
Now, the Air Force is giving an option of 'Permanent Commission' along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that in our armed forces, women power is contributing in addition to male power.
Women are empowered and now they are getting armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our officers in the navy, Abhilash Tomy, was giving a brink of life and death.
The entire country was worried about how to save them.
You all are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a brave soldier.
He is the first Indian officer to travel in the world with a small name from any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, in the South Indian Ocean, he used to keep his speed on the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race. However, the Cyclonic Ocean Cyclonic Storm created a crisis in front of him but the brave Indian navy continued to wreak havoc in the sea for several days.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and that will inspire the young generation of our country with the strength of courage, courage, determination and determination.
My dear countrymen, small children are also aware of the importance of this day on 2nd October for our country.
On 2nd October this year, we have a special significance.
Two years from now, we are going to organize several programmes across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis ideas inspired the whole world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, the great vibhuti, everyone gained strength from Gandhijis ideals and fought a long way to give our people the right to equality and dignity.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to discuss another important work of our revered Bapu, more and more people should know about it.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was insisted on reforming these ideas, he added.
Respected Bapu put his thoughts before the countrymen on issues such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages, workers, spreading cleanliness and education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public collector.
It was his nature to connect people, to mix with them.
Everyone had certainly experienced the uniqueness of his past.
He gave everyone the experience that he was the most important and vital person for the country.
The biggest contribution in the freedom struggle is that they made this struggle a mass movement.
Representing Mahatma Gandhis call for the freedom movement, every section of the society, every section of the society, every section of the society humbled themselves.
Bapu had given you an inspirational mantra.
Can he gain control over his life and destiny
Whether this will enable crores of people to get Swaraj, those who are hungry and their soul is insufficient...
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and your ego has started to end.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, the growing economic strength of all the stakeholders, the growing purchasing power, can we remember Bapu for a moment when we are going to buy something
Whoever is lucky, whose purchase will benefit directly or indirectly...
If we benefit the poorest of the poor, I will be very happy.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind, while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the days to come, we must pay attention to the fact that some country should be built because of its purchase.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step of ours can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
But it was achieved that India got independence.
Today, we can feel that this small task of mine can also contribute to the economic progress of my country, to the economic empowerment of the poor and to the fight against poverty.
In today's era, this is the true patriotism, this is the work of revered Bapu.
He said that all these Khadi clothes have been made very carefully, and every thread should be used.
The feeling of intimacy towards the nation and affection for the countrymen was different from that of the great man of the child.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists.
With the name of Shastri ji, the feeling of indomitable faith emerges in the minds of the people of India.
His gentle personality is always a matter of pride for every citizen.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined to be a mountain.
His announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is a recognition of his immense personality.
This was the result of his unwavering penance towards the nation that he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country in a short span of about one and a half years.
My dear countrymen, if we remember the revered Bapu today then it is natural that we will not remain without talking about cleanliness.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in this programme and I got the good fortune of Shramdaan at Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to that school which was laid by the venerable Baba Saheb himself.
People from all over the country participated in the Shramdaan on the 15th of this month.
Hririri participated in the event.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, private enterprises, all made huge contributions to Swachhta Shramdaan.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these Swachhata lovers.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has proved to be a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world.
At this time, India is organizing the largest global cleanliness conclave in history, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers and experts from all over the world are collectively exploring their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude with the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on 2nd October, 2018.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: "Judicial Swaraj is the root cause of Swaraj. When there is talk of justice, the spirit of human rights is inherent in it.
This is especially essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the deprived and the underprivileged.
The Constitution of Baba Saheb Ambedkar provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on October 12, 1993.
The NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
The NHRC has worked towards protecting human rights as well as enhancing human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the country's former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clarified that human rights are not a different concept for us.
In a reflection of our National Human Rights Commission, all the buildings of the Vedic times have been depicted as Sukhina.
NHRC has created widespread awareness of human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing abuse.
In this 25 year journey, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society, for the best democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the National Level Human Rights Act.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and behave in a manner that is the basis of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas.
This year also, with your efforts, organize the Run for Unity in your village, city and metropolitan cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb for unity because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society through the 'Run for Unity' on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for the auspicious festival of Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today the festival of Rakhi Purnima is being celebrated across the country.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan is a symbol of love and trust between sisters and brothers.
Janmashtami will also be celebrated soon.
The hailstorms of 'Hathi, Ghoda, Palki-Jai Kanhaiyalal Ki, Govinda-Govinda' will be the hailstorm of all around.
The joy of going in the colour of Lord Sri Krishna is different .
Udai Sanskrit - Dinamasti.
Sanskrit languages like Sarala etc.
Brothers and sisters, Besides the Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as a Sanskrit Day.
We are also proud of the fact that from time immemorial to the present, Sanskrit has played a very important role in spreading knowledge.
In Sanskrit language and literature in this language, there is a sense of knowledge about every field of life.
Moreover, there is a mention of the mantras that give a detailed answer in the Sanskrit language of today's global problem, the challenge of sustainable growth.
You all will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language to speak.
You will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language can create new words in this language.
What is the importance of Guru Namka in life , it is said in a well-known subscription that Ekampi Akshramastu , Guru : disciples are in Prabodhya .
My dear countrymen, monsoon rain brings a new hope for our hardworking farmer brothers and sisters.
This is a boon for the sand, dried bushes, frozen reservoirs due to extreme heat.
However, for some time this extremely disastrous, catastrophic Mahapura can be brought.
Rainfall at most places has taken place at most places in the country.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity improve their nature at the earliest.
But even in such times, we see the philosophy of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody will provide all possible assistance to the manufacturers, be it in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He made tireless efforts to save the lives of people stuck in the floods.
Whether it is the Air Force or the Navy or the Air Force or the Army, the Border Security Force, CISF, RAF and the Army have played a very important role in the rescue and relief operations.
Let us pray that in this holy period of Onam, the country, particularly Kerala, should get the strength to come out of this crisis as soon as possible and get a good momentum in the development journey of Kerala.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of Kerala who have suffered such an extreme drought in the country that the entire country is with us in such a difficult situation.
For the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that even after ten years of age the common man in India had a great affection for Atal ji.
India will always be grateful to Atalji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has led to two important changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of States has been restricted to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limits set under the Contrary Act were one-third, increased to two-thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been fixed to ensure that the members who have made changes in their synergy are insufficient.
Atalji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for the country's budget was changed in the House.
In 2001, Atal ji changed his time to go for the budget in Parliament to the morning.
Some of the rules of the Convention enabled the tricolor to flutter public space.
It gave more and more Indians the opportunity to flag off our national flag.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our beloved Tricolor closer to the people.
As a opponent, people consider themselves as opponents.
He saw that I pay my homage to Atal ji by reiterating his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had pronounced the sentence of death penalty only for five days.
In Rajasthan, the courts there have been quick decisions regarding the atrocities of women in a similar manner.
The Act will play a pivotal role in curbing the atrocities committed against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the members have come together with an ideal text.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country at the public level.
My dear countrymen, today the attention of millions and millions of Indians is being drawn to the Asian Games.
Asian sports are still on.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has gone up, especially by our participants, it gives a very positive signal.
Let us look at our architecture because a healthy, healthy country can build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Greetings, I respect your emotions.
Everyone is amazed to see the 'ueen Ki Bau' built in the eleventh century in Patna, Gujarat.
The land of India will be called as a lab of engineering.
Several engineers in India have brought out these things that are possible only in concepts.
We have got such a glimpse in our tradition that shares the legacy of great engineers.
This is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Visvesvaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the Kaveri river is still benefitting lakhs of farmers, brothers and sisters.
In Kutch, it is called Bhunga.
My houses have seen and experienced 3-3 earthquakes.
I myself have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But just go inside, you don't see any damage.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature and geographical composition of this place.
After seeing that house, I was contemplated in my mind that even before many ages, the engineers of that period had done the same thing in accordance with the local situation and had studied the way they could keep the public safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think about the future.
Workshops should be taken at places .
What should we learn in the changing times
What things should people learn
How to connect
Nowadays, a lot of work has been done in disaster management.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
How can we have a new format of structural engineering
How will it have different courses
What should the student class learn about it
Several such things should be considered when the Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of celebrations.
At the same time, preparations for Diwali will also start.
We will continue to meet in Mann Ki Baat and talk about it.
At the same time, we will be working to take our country forward with all our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
Some people in some parts are still waiting for Varunaraja.
India is vast and there is diversity in it, but in this country sometimes the kingdom of Varun demonstrates its favouriteness.
In such a situation, the most important responsibility is that we all should become the protector of nature, protector of nature, protector of nature.
If we become nature-friendly then the balance of nature-specific things will automatically be achieved.
You must have seen this incident on television.
In fact, it takes usually a few hours to return back after going to that cave.
Now it is not possible to come out. After remembering this, these kids took shelter in a cave at some height.
However, he did not have a few days, but Tabbal stayed within 18 days.
Now you can imagine that when there is a direct death in front, how his moments would have been in a mental state.
On the one hand, these daughters were bowing to the crisis and on the other hand humanity in the whole world was united and manifesting the divine qualities.
Specially, after seeing everyone's very moderate behavior, I feel that this is a learning, a learning and a learning quality.
Those whose daughters were stubborn, their parents didn't feel sad or they didn't get hurt due to pain.
But with patience and patience, the peaceful behavior of the entire society is a very important thing.
A Thai Navy soldier had to lose his life in the entire mission of this assistance.
These soldiers showed the courage and patience of helping those who were stuck in the cave in a very difficult situation, full of water and darkness.
This incident demonstrated that whenever humanity was united, such strange things happen.
But for that, we need to focus only on peaceful and stable mindsets and focus on those things that we are working for.
A few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was a speciality.
He had great faith in himself along with hope, confidence and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and inspiring for all Indians.
However, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers brothers and all the youngsters.
Because there is a problem of admission to colleges during this period.
Millions of youth like Satyam are coming out of their lives and entering colleges.
Youngsters take steps on a new path of life and when they come out of the question then they come out on a cut-off.
Now the attention of the students comes from the house to the hostel.
Students have come out of the umbrella of their parents and come under the umbrella of their professors.
I am sure that my young friends may be very enthusiastic about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, you should leave your house and leave your village and go to the other side, you must get out of a safe environment and become yourself.
Many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you that stay calm and enjoy this life.
You have to study but you must have the natural eagerness of finding new things while learning.
Old friends have a special role.
I was watching about how a student named Asharam Choudhary, among a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh, had achieved academic success in facing many challenges in his life.
The entrance examination of MBBS for ASHARAM Jodhpurs AIIMS has expired in the first attempt.
Anushka Pandey, a Divyang Kanya of Gurgaon, is born with a genetic disease of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
All of them have achieved this thing that the entire world will be watching it with their determination and with all the difficulties faced by them.
If we look everywhere, we will find many such examples.
Any good incident in any part of the country or in any part of the country gives me energy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes fell on a news story, I had written, Two youths fulfilled the dream of Modi.
On reading the news, we realized that today our youngsters are using technology to bring about change in the lives of the common man.
The incident was that San Jose City in America was considered as the hub of technology and once I was talking to the Indian youth there.
At that time I urged them to think about how you can use the wisdom of yourself and how you can use Hushari for your India.
I had called for brain-drain solutions to this problem.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my request and brought in an innovative vision.
With the help of our professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly created a SmartGov App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the entire world but also provides information and information on our mobile phones through this app.
The residents of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, the head of the village Sarpanch, the District Penalty, the Chief District Officer, have created awareness among the people about the use of this app.
Well, you say that the legacy of Pandharpur is a wonderful journey.
Friends, this year, on the 23rd of July, Ashadi Ekadashi, Pandharpur is celebrated with great devotion.
Pandharpur is a holy city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In Palkhi, the great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, Warkari walks on foot towards Mridung Bawat Pandharpur while roaming around the Thoon Vithal Nama.
Vithal, who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang, can reach Pandharpur for his vision.
It is a deity that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion towards Panduranga.
Go to the temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
Important messages of goodwill, love and brotherhood have been given from the literature of these saints.
The Saints gave a mantra to give the strength to fight the society against superstitions.
And he also took the responsibility of eliminating old evils from the society and compassion, equality and sensitivity towards the minds of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak i. e.
The British consistently tried to prove him by running a sedition barrier three times in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell my countrymen a rage on the effigy of Lokmanya Tilak and his effigy in Ahmedabad.
At that time, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for his reception and during his visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with Tilak.
The personality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by the ideas.
On August 1, 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak was confronted, Patel decided to build a memorial for Tilak in Ahmedabad.
And Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial on 28th February, 1929, not by anyone else but by Mahatma Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, this effigy is very rare and Lokmanya Tilak has settled on a chair and has written that 'Swaraj Hamara Janmadhi Dhara Hai' is at the bottom of Tilak.
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium of social awareness, collective action, harmony and equality among the people along with traditional devotion and devotion.
In that particular period, there was a need to fight unitedly against the British.
And because of the festivals organised by the television teams, they used to work in the society to break the walls of the communities and unite them all.
The popularity of organising these festivals has increased in the Ogha of the time and it has been seen that today's young generation is also very attractive to the brave heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today, in many cities and in almost every street, a pavilion of Ganesh festivals is seen.
The Ganapati festival is organized by all the families of the streets.
Even here, our youth get good opportunities, their leadership, festival organizers, event organizers, coordinators, and their qualities can be developed.
Everything from the idol of Ganeshji to decorative items should be environment friendly.
Today, every Indian needs to get good results of good governance and development.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad brought his life but he never bowed down to foreign rule.
I am fortunate that Chandrashekhar Azad is the village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I got the opportunity to visit this village.
I got the opportunity to pay my homage to the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, I had promised that Chandrashekhar Azad would not have the courage to die by the bullets of foreigners, he would continue to fight for independence till the end of his life, he would have sacrificed his life after the independence.
This was a special feature of him.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and daughter of a landlord, Hima Das, won a gold medal in the 400-meter race of Geener Under-20 World Athletics winnership.
I have been sent an e-mail from Indonesia to answer my letter to another unity hub of the country and is currently preparing for the Asian Sports Championship.
The unity in our e-mail has been written that one of the most important moments in the life of an athlete is the moment when a player catches a tricolor in his hand.
Unity, we all feel proud of you.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
Unity has won gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 in Tunisia.
We have to move forward, play and keep developing.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place this month, but due to the monsoon season, there is a lot of illness in the house.
Once again I will meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I once again got the opportunity to interact with you through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
A few days ago, there was a historic battle of cricket in Bangalore.
You must have noticed that I would like to talk about the Cricket Cricket between India and Afghanistan.
The two sides showcased very good sports in this fight.
Rashid Khan, an Afghan warrior, had done a very good job in IPL this year.
I thank our Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
You represent what is best and best in Afghanistan.
We have come to know about the sportsperson's attitude, the feeling of sportspersonship.
Sports is a very good medium for uniting the society and showing the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that even after this, we will continue to play with each other and continue to grow.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different view.
Whether it is the European Parliament, the UN headquarters in New York or the Japanese Naval Warship, people are seen performing yoga all over the world.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic Yoga programme was organised and I came to know that women did the guidance of several asanas this time.
Indian and Chinese soldiers jointly practiced Yoga on the high altitude snow peak in Ladakh.
We are working to bridge the boundaries and connect everyone.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day with great fervor, beyond caste, religion, region, colour or sex.
Had people from all over the world participated in such exciting events on Yoga Day, wouldn't it have been an excitement for them in India
Our country's security forces have performed yoga at three places like Jawans, Pilgrims, Navy, Hawaii Dal.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga on Panbudi.
Some soldiers performed Yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors surprised everyone by performing Yoga in the sky at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
It should be said that he did not do yoga by sitting on the plane, he did Yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports fields, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has done the job of uniting people all over the world by crossing the boundaries of caste, creed and geographical boundaries and we have been living in the world since ancient times in the spirit of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'.
Our sages, saints and sages have always emphasized on this idea.
Today, Yoga has proved it in the right way and has shown it in the instrument.
Today, I believe that the idea of Wellness is working as a revolution.
As we see Mother as God, mother gives birth to us, we consider her as God, this is our culture.
Sometimes doctors give us reproduction.
The role of doctors is not limited to medication alone.
Not only do the doctors have medical knowledge but they also have a very good experience about the effects of their lifestyle, the impact of which Shaila can now be borne and how it has a good effect on our health.
Indian doctors have displayed their unlimited capabilities and skills and have created their own separate, independent identity across the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
India has a rich history.
When I was in Gujarat, when I was working there, people of the tradition of Saint Kabir had organized a big national session.
In the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Saint Kabir Das had embraced Maghar.
But did you know that Kabirdas ji chose this place for a moment
At that time he believed that those who die here are not able to find a place in heaven.
And on the contrary, those who sacrifice their lives in Kashi go to heaven.
But Sant Kabirdas had no faith in such things.
Saint Kabir Das ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through goodwill and compassion.
This was his ideal.
We see this ideal through their creations.
The meaning of this is that whoever considers the pain of another person is true fakir and saint .
And those who do not know the misery of others are loyal.
Kabirdas ji emphasised on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and they should be respected.
Even today, despite such a long time, Kabir's words are equally effective.
Today, we have read and heard about Kabir ji's words, we feel that these things are telling us about the ages of knowledge.
We feel that their thoughts are consistent with the present times.
Now we are talking about Saint Kabirdas ji. In this context, I remember one of his couplets, he says: Guru Gobind Dou Khadi, Kake Application
There is such a great Guru, Jagatguru-Guru Nanakdev.
He has shown the ways of crores of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is to serve God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the betterment of the society.
He brought in a socially discriminatory kitchen system, where a person belonging to any caste, creed or sect can feed on the kitchen and Guru Nanak Dev started the langar system.
The 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated by Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
The catastrophic catastrophe in Jallianwala Bagh will be 100 years in 2019, which will be a major blow to the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always victorious.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on his Jayanti and in today's programme, I will pay my tributes to Dr.
During the period 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had contributed immensely.
West Bengal was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Let's go, let's all talk about Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
It will be said that they have got the opportunity to go beyond the files and know about the changes in the lives of the people.
In remote and remote villages, youngsters are providing services to the elderly people of the villages through Common Service Centre, from wages to paperlessness.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to collect Sitafall and make her ice cream.
In Jharkhand, like Anjan Prakash, lakhs of youth across the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable rates in nearby villages.
I am extremely happy that the success of the common man is greater than the success of the government in this entire programme.
The government will not be credited with the hope, new enthusiasm and events that have taken place in the life of the common man in such a disappointing environment.
The incident of a small girl from a small village in remote and remote areas also inspires 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology, a moment spent with the beneficiaries through video bridge has become extremely pleasant and inspiring for me.
It gives new joy, new enthusiasm and new inspiration to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge programme and they gave me a new strength.
I would like to once again thank all of you for this.
On the one hand there are professionals and technologists, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters working in the fields.
Now you must also be wondering that agriculture and technology are two different businesses, what is their relationship
The schemes have been formulated and their successful efforts have been made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, from the production of cotton to its marketing, the role of farmer brothers is important and on the other hand, we are trying to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profits.
Friends
This work that you have done in your youth is really inspiring youngsters.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
I would like to give the most credit to the States for bringing about One Nation, One Tax reforms.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the States together decided for the interest of the nation and thereafter tax reforms can be done at such a large scale in the country.
Till date, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and the meeting is attended by people with different political views.
There were 17 different types of taxation systems in the country before the GST but now only one tax system has been implemented in the new system throughout the country.
GST is a victory of honesty and it is also a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, there were complaints regarding Inspectorraj in tax cases several times.
GST may be the biggest tax reform in the world.
Generally, a period of 5-7 years would have been enforced to improve the situation of such a massive Lok Sabha and to stabilize the entire scheme in a complete manner.
Namaskar had recently held 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
When there is such an environment, someone can remain untouched by it.
This was the time when people from all over the country wanted to think about which sports persons would play today.
How many medals we have won, how many medals we have achieved, all these were very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well by fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal in a short while.
Whether it is neembaji or cottage, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton India has done its best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze India has earned a total of 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
Winning a medal is a matter of pride and joy for every sportsperson.
It is a moment of great pride for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be shortened to express that feeling.
But I would like to tell you what I have heard from these players.
This is because there were many such things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions she took.
She is the first Indian female sportsperson who won Indias first gold medal in the individual table tennis event.
India won the highest medal.
15-year-old Indian cinematographer Anish Bharar became the youngest sportsperson to win the Gold in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary, who won the Commonwealth Games medal, is the only Indian para power elevator.
This time the sports competition was special because most of the medal winners were the women sportspersons.
Women sportspersons showcased excellent performances such as squash, boxing, weightlifting, sportsmanship.
Everyone was anxious about this fight, both medals would be received by India - all witnessed the fight.
The sportspersons from different parts of the country had come from small towns.
His friends have also contributed, who have raised his patience in every situation.
Last month in Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen, especially to our youth for Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India, represent Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have written letters showing their support, have sent letters and shared their health mantra on social media - Fit India Gatha.
A householder, Shashikant Bhosale, shared his illustrations in the water conservation pond, My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I am happy and healthy because of the morning walk.
And they say: Four me - fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, which we are happy.
There is no doubt that there is health in happiness.
While sharing his photograph of mountaineering, Dhawal Prajapati wrote, "Tour and Mountaineering for me is Fit India".
I am very happy to see that many famous personalities are encouraging our youth in a very attractive manner for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on the Twitter.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences while participating in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
One more thing I will definitely say - Yoga is the name of Fit India Movement without spending any money.
On 21st June, the significance of International Day of Yoga is now being adopted by the whole world.
You will also be ready from now on.
Your cities, your villages, your departments, your schools, your colleges, every person of any age - male or female, should try to participate in yoga.
Today, I would like to invite you to do a new job and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new during this time.
My young friends, I urge you to participate in a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, Human Resource Development or Drinking Water Department, have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, youngsters from NCC, youngsters from NSS, youth from Nehru Yuva Kendras, who want to make changes in society, who want to become participants
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will enjoy doing something before that. And I also tell you that those who have been the best trainees who have done good work in colleges, those who have done excellent work in the universities will be given the National Awards.
Moreover, the UGC will provide two credit points to the trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this internship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship on Mygov.
I hope that our youngsters will certainly succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these vacations as an opportunity to experience a new one.
This group of youngsters has launched a massive campaign to educate children on roads and slums.
Initially, due to the situation of the children who had asked for money or the small and big things on the roads, they shook themselves completely in this work.
Starting from 15 children in the slums near Gita Colony in Delhi, the mission has now reached 2,000 children in 12 locations in the capital.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this mission have participated in this buzzing effort to bring about a social change by taking two hours out of their busy days.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the hilly region of Uttarakhand have been a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fate not only of their own but also of our region by collective efforts.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, Maka or Java are mainly cooked in Mandwa, Chaulai.
He started making biscuits from this farm crop and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative society in Munnar village and they have opened a factory to produce biscuits there.
Taking into account the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to the fifty Anganwadi center of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has not only reached 10-15 lakh rupees, but it has also reduced the migration from the district due to the employment opportunities being given to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks of this thing but isn't it our responsibility
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every individual should be responsible.
Over the centuries our ancestors have demonstrated this.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered new ways to save every drop of water.
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have written great inscriptions in some temples of Tamil Nadu regarding irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will see great inscriptions everywhere.
Even today, different wildlife are popular as tourist destinations but we do not forget that these are the living proofs of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors.
The queen of Adlaj and Patan in Gujarat is a UNESCO World Heritage, whose magnificence is worth seeing.
Vihiri is in a way a water temple .
If you go to Rajasthan then you will definitely visit Chand Vihar in Jodhpur .
This is India's largest and well-known destination and the most important thing is that there is water scarcity in the region.
April, May, June, July is the best time to harvest rain water and if we prepare it before then we will get the maximum benefit.
The MNREGA fund is also used for this water conservation work.
In the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts towards water conservation and water conservation.
In addition to the MNREGA fund every year, an average expenditure of Rs 32,000 crore has been incurred on water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, 55 of the total outlay of Rs. 64 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by these water conservation and water conservation measures.
The district administration under MNREGA has taken up the responsibility of large scale land and water conservation.
With the help of people from about 40 to 45 villages, the dry rivers have been revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this is a big success.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June and July, we should take some responsibilities for water conservation, we should also formulate some schemes and we should do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages, letters and phone calls from all sides.
Ian Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on Mygov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the philosophy of the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's life in peace, beautiful and honesty.
Please discuss this topic in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can get information about it.
I express my gratitude to Ianji for drawing the attention of all the companions of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a man of wisdom and wisdom, whose writing has created a stupendous impact on all.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person, but he was a teacher every moment.
I was used to listening to Rabindra Sangeet early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to listen to this poem Anandaloke and Aguner, Poroshmani then I got a new emotion.
You must have composed Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The holy month of Ramzan will begin in a few days.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full devotion and respect all over the world.
The collective objective of the day is that when a person is hungry, he also feels the hungryness of others.
When he feels thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the Prophets: What is the best thing in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, Whether you know them or not, to provide food to the poor and the needy and to judge everyone in a smooth manner.
Mohammad believed in his knowledge and compassion.
They were not arrogant about anything.
They used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Mohammad believed that a person is not because of his wealth but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcases the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds Lord Buddha of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, unity and fraternity.
These are human values that are most important in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to insist that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people be it dalits, oppressed, exploited or deprived by the slaughter.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion.
Mercy was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha to understand the misery of the people.
It is said that the Buddhist monks traveled to different countries, taking along with them the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha and this always happens.
Throughout Asia, the legacy of the teachings of Lord Buddha has been obtained.
Many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar have deepened many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings. And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist destinations in Southeast Asia to important Buddhist destinations in India.
I am very happy that the Government of India is a partner in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Ananda Temple in Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, everywhere in the world there is conflict and human misery, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end the enlightenment.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have believed in the principle of compassion and devotion to Lord Buddha all over the world.
Lord Buddha seeks blessings for the entire world so that we can fulfill our obligation to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Laughing Buddha, it is believed that laughing Buddha brings good fortunes, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in Indias defence history.
Now you are wondering what is the relation between smiling Buddha and the military power of India
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998 atomic tests were conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Twenty years have been completed and this test was conducted on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus India showed its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that those days have been marked in the history of India as its military strength.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we are strong as a country, we all walk peacefully with each other.
Since nuclear tests were conducted in the month of May 1998, this month is not only important for the country but the way these tests were conducted is important.
This incident showed the whole world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and India can attain new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
When we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 11th May, 1998, then every young man should take a pledge to contribute to making a modern India by assimilating the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan' that Atalji had given us for Indias strength.
Participate your strength in the strength of India.
We can also get a new joy and a new satisfaction of taking the journey that Atalji had started.
My dear countrymen, visit the next Mann Ki Baat programme and beat up more.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
A few days ago, on 26th January, when all the heads of the ASEAN countries had come here, the art gallery of that country had also come here with them.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of them presented the Ramayana to us.
It means that the Ramayana and the Ramayana are not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, as usual, I have received a large number of letters, emails, phone calls and responses from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about the launch of Sanskrit online class on MyGov.
I read a copy of Shri Dhanshyam Kumar ji from Barkar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed on the depletion of ground water is of course very important.
Shree Shree Shakal Shastri ji of Karnataka wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when it is Ayushman Bhoomi.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji says that I should talk about the health of the youth.
If we compare ourselves with other Asian countries, Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that this time I will talk to all about health in detail - Strong India.
Prashant ji had shared all those photos and videos on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi App.
Now, please lick that photo and revite it to your friends.
Anagha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written to me the gratitude cards they have given behind the book "Exam Warrior".
Angha, Jayesh and all the other children, I would like to tell you all that your letters make me feel tired of the day.
I got so many letters, so many phone calls and reactions that I could read all these things.
Even if I decide to tell you the same thing today, I will have to tell you the same thing every month.
More and more journals have been sent to the children and they have also taken up examinations.
I have been told about our planets in the winter.
Animals and birds do not get water in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers about the farming fairs and those things that are happening in the country.
Some awakening citizens have suggested measures for water conservation.
Ever since we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio, I have experienced a method since then, more and more letters come to the topics related to summer.
Pre-examination journals cover the examination of students.
It means that things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things of our minds change the weather in some other life and why not change the weather
When I get to read in your letters how Raksha Mantri Ahmad Ali from Karimganj in Assam has built nine schools for poor children with the strength of his will power, then I see the indomitable will power of our country.
When I got to hear about Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary of Kanpur, he goes to the pavement to feed the poor and also provides free medicines then I get the opportunity to feel the brotherhood of the country.
Several travelers travelling in their cabs helped them a lot.
An engineer girl paid her first full salary.
Thus, after 12 years of collection of funds, the untiring efforts of Shri Saidul Laskar have been successful.
Today, due to his resolve and hard work, he has made a sickle house with a provision of about 30 beds in Punari village near Kolkata.
Today, the vision of the entire world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, then it is the fulfilment of these sons and daughters of Mother India.
A positive atmosphere of hope and confidence has emerged.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfill our resolve of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Scientists, Lohiaji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all of them consider agriculture and farmers as an integral part of the economy and general life of the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri also emphasized on the protection of trees, plants and plants and better agricultural infrastructure.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh had urged the farmers to use new technologies, innovate and use them.
This state, which has a very small area, has made great strides.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have achieved record production during 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have proved from their experience that when the goals are fixed, there are solid resolves and will powers to realize that they are fulfilled.
Brothers and sisters, Important decisions have been taken in this budget to ensure that the farmers get the right price.
It has been decided that the notified crops will be guaranteed at least one and a half times the cost of their production.
The cost of production that will be taken into account for the humidity, the wages and expenses of the labourers working on the farm, the cost of animal labour, equipment, equipment or animals, the cost of seeds, the price of all types of fertilizers used by the state government, the value of all types of fertilizers given to the state government, the value of the fertilizer, the value of the fertilizer given to the state government, the farming land is not only on the lease but also on the lease of the land.
Besides, the work of reforming the agriculture sector across the country is also going on at a comprehensive level to ensure that farmers get proper marketing.
Efforts are being made to bring together local markets, grocery markets and global markets in the villages.
In order to ensure that farmers do not have to go far away from selling their produce, they are being modernized by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country, thereafter they will be linked to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to link agriculture to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our pledge, but also how can we bring together 125 crore citizens to commemorate Gandhijis best wishes
How should Gandhi 150 be the logo of the theme
All of us must pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
It was earlier understood that the Health Ministry had the responsibility of doing all the work related to health in the country.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
Preventive care of health is the cheapest and easiest solution.
This will benefit the individuals, the family and the society as much as we are aware of healthcare.
Besides, work is going on at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up a healthcare centre across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity across the world today in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong due to yoga
Due to the commitment of all of us in Yoga, Yoga has become a mass movement today, it has become a mass movement.
This year, on International Day of Yoga, that is, on 21st June, there are more than 100 days.
In the last three years, people participated in every International Yoga Day event in every part of the country and around the world with great enthusiasm.
This year too, we will do yoga ourselves and motivate our entire family, our friends and all others to do yoga.
We have to make it more popular with new, attractive methods of Yoga, children, youth and senior citizens and women and men of every age group.
However, through the medium of television and electronic media in the country, Yoga programmes are being organized throughout the year.
However, from today to Yoga, can some programmes that create awareness about Yoga be taken up as a campaign
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher but a Yoga practitioner.
However, some people have made me a Yoga practitioner using their innovations and some of my Yoga practitioners have made an animated video.
I will be able to share with you this video powder, that is, we can study asana and pranayama.
Today, more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at very affordable rates.
Work is also underway to set up more new centres.
I would like to urge the people of Mann Ki Baat that they must send information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy, that is, their medicine costs will be very low and they will be very big service.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The price of knee implants has been reduced by 50 to 70 per cent.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, nearly 10 crore households, that is, for the treatment of nearly 50 crore citizens, five lakh rupees will be provided by the Government of India and insurance companies in a year.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
We aim to make the entire country TB-free by 2025.
This is a very big task.
Every individual needs to be awakened and you need help for that.
To get rid of tuberculosis all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, this is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He believed that the poorest of the poor could also be provided employment because of the industries.
Today, Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a scenario, the dream that Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of becoming an Industrial Power is inspiring us.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the world economy, the world's largest foreign direct investment is being made in India today.
The entire world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
Keeping these ideas in mind, Smart City Mission and Urban Mission have been launched to provide good roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in his self-reliance.
It was not acceptable for someone to lead a life in poverty.
Besides, he believed that the poor would not be able to get rid of their poverty by providing them with a thrilling facility.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India are bringing young innovators and young entrepreneurs to the country.
He had seen Jal Shakti as a nation power.
The importance of waterways in the development of the country was emphasized on it, and it was Baba Saheb's vision to set up several river-blocked authorities and different water-related commissions.
Today, historical efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in old ports.
During the forty decades, there were major issues of discussion, other great wars, cool wars and conflicts.
In a way, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of the spirit of 'Team India'.
He spoke of the importance of the federal system and emphasized the need for the Centre and States to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federalism in every sphere of the government and competitive cooperative federalism.
And most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of backward classes like me.
They have shown us that there is no need to be born in a reputed family to move forward in life, but those who are born in a poor family in India can also fulfil their dreams and they can succeed in it.
Sometimes many people attacked Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India of Ambedkar, of the poor, of the backward classes.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
It will provide a wide range of programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, several festivals like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming in the coming days.
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is a day of learning from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who gave the message of non-violence, are inspiring for us all.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
He recalled the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus, and gave the message of peace, goodwill, justice, kindness and compassion to the people of mankind.
In April the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India .
Many Thanks
We are the first to see the colour of the ocean blue but in everyday life we feel that water is colorless, it does not have color.
Whether it is river or sea or water, whether it looks colorful or not
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
A great scientist of modern India emerged from this question.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
He is known as Raman Effect.
On 28th February, Raman had discovered the light scattering, so every year we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day, he received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
This country has given several great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there was a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other hand, Surat and Charaka have a place of pride in healthcare.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose, scientists are the pride of India.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose has also been given the name of the famous Boson particle.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme of the Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
Artificial intelligence helps in the creation of robots and specially working machines.
Nowadays machines are smarting their own intellect by self-scheduling.
This technology can be used to ease the lives of the poor, the deprived and the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make the lives of differently abled brothers and sisters easier.
Can we imagine the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to visit Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There a young man had developed such a digital device that he could not speak, he wrote that his voice was transformed and he could interact with this person just as he spoke to a person.
I believe that in many such places we can use artificial intelligence.
The instrument works as you wish.
But what we want to do from the system depends on us.
The human objective here is important, the use of science for human welfare, the use of science for attaining the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the light of electricity, was often devastated by his many experiments.
When asked about this, he told them that I have discovered ten thousand methods of how not to make lights of electricity, that is, Adison has made his own strength.
Today, through Yoga, I am here in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and asked for responsibilities against their rule.
As a great sage, he raised questions about every aspect of his life.
He showed the path to humanity by exploring the answer.
The spirit of repeated questions is important to understand the truth.
Behind the scientific discovery this very hole is also an inspiration .
Whether or not the answers to these questions should not be restored.
On National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and scientific field.
May our younger generation inspire for the discovery of truth and knowledge and inspire us to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of complications, in times of crisis, security and disasters.
From Pune, Rabindra Singh has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile Power on the subject of Professional Security.
He wrote that the quality of safety in our country is not that good at factories and construction sites.
On the occasion of Indias National Safety Day on 4th March, the Prime Minister said, "Safety should be taken up in this programme, which will enhance awareness among the people about safety.
When we talk about Public Safety, two things are important, privacy and preparation.
Safety is of two types one that is essential during disaster and the other is essential in daily life.
In our daily lives, we were not aware of security, but it was difficult to secure during disasters.
We are conscious that if we follow the necessary rules then we can not only protect our lives but also save our society from the worst accidents.
We see that there are many things written about safety at workplace but it does not seem to be following.
The municipal corporations who have fire engines should go to different schools in a week or month to drive a mock drill in front of the students.
It will have two benefits, the Agricultural Party will also have the habit of staying alert and the new generation will also get education about it and it will not need to spend differently, in a way it will become a part of education.
Speaking of disasters and disasters, India is geographically diverse.
This country has witnessed some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management in the country.
Disaster-related NDMAs such as earthquakes, floods, plains and landslides are rushing.
Training and awareness have an important role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in the heat wave and then NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness about it.
This shows that if we give priority to security then we can achieve security.
Fire Services, National Disaster Response Force, Armed Forces, Armed Forces, Ex-Servicemen are helping the people not to preserve their lives in times of crisis.
NCCs and scouts also assist in this work and impart training.
The joint disaster management exercise of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal was also the first and wider endeavour.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this period's budget, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the emphasis has been laid on creating energy from waste to wealth and waste to the village through biogas.
Initiatives have been initiated to rename cow dung money, organic bio agro resource.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from poultry and biological fertilizers but it was not utilized in India with full potential.
We are moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
The target is to utilise livestock poultry, farm waste and kitchen waste to generate biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers of rural India will be encouraged to look at the waste and waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in cleaning the villages.
It will help in increasing income for farmers and animal husbandry.
Garbage, transportation and sale of biogas will increase employment opportunities.
An on-line platform will be created for proper implementation of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers to the consumer and will provide a fair price to the poultry and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take the lead by creating a savings group and by creating a cooperative society.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement for clean energy and green employment and take initiatives to convert the waste of our villages into wealth and transform the sewage into wealth.
Different artifacts were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people about all aspects of waste management.
Everyone took up innovative ideas about cleanliness and presented poems.
An atmosphere of cleanliness was created.
Particularly schoolchildren participated in it.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation and Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the festival was celebrated.
Every year 8th March is celebrated as International Women's Day.
Several events are organized in the country and around the world.
Women who have done remarkable work in different fields are honoured this day.
Today, the country is moving ahead with the development of women under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I recall Swami Vivekananda's thoughts, he had said, Ideal women's concept is freedom.
125 years ago, Swami ji's thoughts reflect the idea of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
We are a part of a tradition where men are recognized by women, the son of success, the son of skill, the son of Gandhi.
Women are empowered, empowered and equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good thing to me, he said that on 8th March there are several programmes on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahi 50 thousand Raj Mistri.
You can imagine what a big event is.
The women of Jharkhand have demonstrated that women power is the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into a peoples mood in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I had told that electricity had reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and after that it had spread its joy.
You know that this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
For 70 years, there was darkness in the lives of the people of Rajbander, Morbandar and Set Port in three villages in Elephant.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
I am glad that the Elephanta village and the caves are now brightened.
This is not just a power but a new beginning.
What could be a matter of greater joy than to enjoy the lives of the people of the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated Mahashivaratri.
The unique feature of this month is the culmination of cooks and nectar clearances during the month of March.
We love this month for the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March, Holi will be celebrated across the country with enthusiasm.
Holi is as important as Holika Dahna. It is a day to burn the evil spirit.
May this festival be auspicious in the lives of our people.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much. Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
For the first time in 2018, we are interacting with ourselves through Mann Ki Baat.
Two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The event was attended by the honourable guests from ten countries for the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathi.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are progressing in every sector in India, they are moving ahead and the values of the country are rising.
It is a matter of immense pride and honour for the women of our country since ancient times and their contribution to the society.
There is a great tradition of great enemies in India.
Several adversaries in India have an important contribution in the creation of Vedas.
Lopadumra, Gargi, Maitreyi, many names can be taken.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society and her family in the throne of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar like Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi of the Vedic times, a saint like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, or a saint of great enlightenment and devotional paths like Ahilyabai Holkar or a brave girl like Rani Laxmibai, women power is always inspiring us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that the journey of our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman from the Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft will inspire him.
The three brave women who have become fighter arbitrators are now trained in Sukhoi-30.
A few days ago, the Honble President started a new chapter.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met a group of women who have made extraordinary performances in their respective fields for the first time.
Our women power has done extraordinary work to solve the traditions of the society and established a new record.
He demonstrated that if there is any difficulty, if there is any obstacle then he can cross it, cross it and create a new path by crossing it.
Now this path not only inspires our contemporary people but also inspires generations to come forward.
This book is available in the form of 'Narendra Modi Website' Varsuddha e-book.
Today, women power of this country plays a very important role in the positive transformation in the country and society.
Today, when we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station here.
Now we must have thought about the relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga railway station in Mumbai which has all the women employees.
There are women employees in all the departments at this station.
Several people wrote on the Twitter and other social media after seeing the deliberations of the Republic Day that all women had participated in the BSF Bikar Continent.
These women were experiencing very adventurous experiments and they also surprised the visitors who came from abroad.
Both words empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today, our women are leading.
They are also becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have produced a new picture in front of the country.
The area of Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh is under Maoist influence.
The violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols and the Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere here.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a dangerous area by running e-rickshaws.
Whether any social life is introduced or not, whether it has changed its own way or not
Continuous efforts are being made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and evils and practices.
Just a few days back, a good effort was made in Bihar.
It was the world's longest human chain that was built in the state to destroy social evils at a distance of more than 13,000 kilometers.
In this campaign, people created awareness among the society against evil practices such as child marriage, hoonda etc.
The entire state took a pledge to fight against evils like Hunda and Balwah.
Young people, mothers and sisters, all of them participated in this campaign.
Starting from the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patan, this human chain was connected to the border of the state.
Our society should be free from such evils so that all the people of the society need to benefit from the true meaning of development.
Let us collectively pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state and every person associated with the human chain.
However, after getting information about Jan AushadhiKendras, they have started buying medicines from there and now the cost of their father's medicines has come down by 75.
It helps the common man, especially the senior citizens of the country, to get a lot of financial assistance.
The generic medicines being procured are similar to the standards set by the WHO.
This is why good quality medicines can be made available at affordable rates.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at Amrit Stores of Hospitals.
The only objective of all these schemes is to provide affordable and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Yut Mangesh has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App from Maharashtra.
My focus on the separation of this photo will be on him.
In this photo, a grandson along with his brothers participated in the Clean Morana River Cleanliness campaign.
I was told that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the 'Morana River' in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Another painful thing is that wild grass, waterfalls were foiled in the river's plate.
Waste and dirt were being thrown on the river and its woods too.
The villagers prepared an action plan and constructed a Swachh Morna Mohim on 13th January, one day before the Makar Sankranti, according to which two works of the Morana river were cleaned at four kilometres in the first phase.
I have been told that till the Morana river is completely cleaned, the Akolekar mission will continue every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then something is impossible.
It can bring about transformation through mass movement.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of discussion about the Padma Awards.
Every year there is a tradition of awarding Padma awards but for the last three years the entire process of awards has been changed.
Now any citizen can give a name for the award.
The entire process has become transparent due to online process.
Now the importance of the work done by the individual is being taken into consideration and the introduction is given to him in order to give him the award.
You must have heard that you will be happy to know the work done by Arvind Gupta ji.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has saved his life in making sports for young children.
They are constantly trying to find out the scientific experiments of the children with useless, frozen things.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showcased the paintings made in 18 different languages and inspired children.
Similar is the story of Sitawa Joddhi of Karnataka.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the past three decades, Sitava has played a major role in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
In the seventh year of his age, he himself had dedicated himself as a devotee, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasi.
Not only this, they have also done great work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor and tribal family.
He used to do a simple job for the purpose of pausing but he had the rhythm to paint traditional tribal paintings.
It is because of this verse that he has received respect not only in India but also in the whole world.
His exhibitions have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The Padma Shri award has been given to him by recognizing the talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who has named India abroad.
He has built more than five hundred medicinal plants on the basis of his memories.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri Award for his social work after exploring the folk artists.
Today, I would like to mention another name here, the 75-year-old sister of West Bengal, Mistry, has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
Subhasini Mistri sold utensils and vegetables in the houses of others for the construction of the hospital.
This life-threatening crisis inspired them to build hospitals for the poor.
Today, free medicines are being provided to thousands of poor people in the hospitals built by their hard work.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who are working around us for the society, who are working for the society, who are dedicating their lives for the society, who are working with some special goals and who have been working for the society sometimes they should be brought to the society.
Such people dont work for dignity at all.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.
Revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India on 9th January from South Africa.
On this day, we are celebrating the festival of unwavering bonds between Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be happy to know that the Mayor, Parliamentarians and Lok Delegates from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and USA and many other countries have participated in the event.
I would like to thank the European Union for doing a remarkable job, creating the identity of the people of the original Indian origin and giving this information to the people of the whole world through a guideline.
Those who showed us a new path are the venerable Bapus death anniversary on 30th January.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or the world, the individual or the family or the society.
Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat is the last event in this rainy season and Yoga is also the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout this year, we talked about several things together and shared a lot of things.
The innumerable letters and reactions that you have received for Mann Ki Baat, the exchange of ideas, all these always gave me new energy.
Now this year is going to change in a few hours but we will continue to talk about this thing, we will continue to talk about it.
In the coming year too, we will discuss new topics and share new experiences.
Many congratulations to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, the Christmas Festival was celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm.
We also see the essence of the spirit of service in the Bible.
The Son of Man Haj Cum, Not to Be Served, But to Serve, And to Giveh His Life, Age Blassingtu All Humankind.
These bends showcase the importance of service, the greatness of service.
Anything that happens in this world, be it religion or tradition or be it alphabet, but the invaluable form of humanity comes from service.
In our country, we are talking about Nishkam Karma, Nikam Karma does not expect anything, it is serving.
We have also been called Seva Parmo Dharma.
Life-service is Shiva-Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhansa has said, "Service yourself with the spirit of life.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The bravery and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh Ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived on the basis of the same values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji inspired people in all such roles as a Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against tyranny and injustice.
He taught people to bind the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these endeavours, he was able to get a lot of money at a personal level.
But he never gave up the spirit of compassion.
Every moment in life, he gave a message of love, sacrifice and peace.
It shows how great and unique his personality was.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the light festival organized in Patna Sahib on the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
One January, 2018.
You will also be surprised to know that the new year will come and it will come every year on 1st January.
But when I say 'specific', that thing is really special.
And I urge all of you to register your names as voters.
The whole of India is keen to welcome us as a voter in the 21st century.
Being a voter in the 21st century, you must be feeling that you are also receiving some respect.
Our opinion is the basis of New India.
The power of vote in democracy is the biggest strength.
Votes are the most effective tools to bring about positive changes in the lives of millions.
We just have the right to vote.
So, what kind of India should we have in the 21st century What should we have in the 21st century India
You will also be the builder of India in the 21st century and it will start from January 1.
I am confident that the vision of New India will be realised by the strength of the skills of this vibrant youth.
When we talk about New India, this new India should be free from toxicities like casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from unhygienic and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guide.
Let the youth of New India come forward and discuss how New India should be.
They should also set a path for us which will be linked to it and this kind of big group will be formed.
We should keep moving ahead and the country will also move forward.
Just as I was talking to you, I got an idea in my mind that can we organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Can youngsters from the age group of 18 to 25 years come together to deliberate on the issue of New India and find ways and make them youngsters
How can we realise our resolve before 2022
What can we do to build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi gave the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, today the need of the hour is that we too should create a mass movement for a grand and divine India in the 21st century.
Today, innumerable new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and getting successful.
I believe that we should create an independent robust system by ensuring that the youth of New India can get information about these schemes in one place.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had told you about the significance of 'sociality'.
Positiveness and zeal are possible for those individuals.
The people in English say: "Pacific Lides to Weekness, Optimism to Power" in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had urged the countrymen to share the positive moments that we experienced in the year 2017 and welcome them in such a positive environment in 2018.
People gave a very positive response on social media, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people have made special strides in their personal lives.

Our area had a very serious problem of water and for the last 40 years we were dependent on the waterways of Armi.
Now there is a free movement for us.
Let us enter the New Year with the same joy and joy, let us take decisive steps to move forward from a positive India to a progressive India in the beginning of New Year.
Now we are talking about positiveness, so I also want to share one thing here.
Recently, I would like to encourage the information about Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who has been ranked top in the administrative service examination in Kashmir.
Terrorism and arbitrariness came out of the atmosphere and secured the first position in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He wrote the story of success in his own hands.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the country.
Anjumana has proved that however evil the situation may be, through positive actions they do the dirt and ruins of disappointment.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet some of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the last week.
I used to know about the will power, the enthusiasm and the dreams of them.
They used to say that in what field they want to make progress in their lives, they used to say that they had a lot of hope in their hearts.
I felt that there was no disappointment in him.
They had enthusiasm, joy, excitement, energy, big dreams and solemn pledges.
I also got a lot of inspiration from these Kashmiris during the time I spent with them.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala when it was discussed not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world.
Every year crores of devotees come to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
P.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every pilgrim considers a part of the worship of God and does something or the other clean.
Now no matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how big a person is, no matter how big a person is, no matter how big a person is, everybody is participating in this programme like a common traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
There is also a strong pledge of cleanliness along with strict versions.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the auspicious occasion of Bapu's birth anniversary, all of us have made a pledge to make a Swachh Bharat, a Clean India free from untouchability.
Efforts are being made on a massive scale across the country towards cleanliness.
Peoples participation in rural as well as urban areas is also showing change.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan-2018 is scheduled to be held from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the extent of sanitation levels in the urban areas and achievements in the Swachhta Mission.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4,000 cities and around 40 crore population of the country.
Whether it is free from open defecation in cities, collection of waste, transportation system, scientific waste management or the efforts to change the habits of the people, what kind of peoples participation in this thing, what kind of efforts are being made to create capacities and to use some innovations for sanitation
During this survey, different teams will be inspecting cities.
They will interact with the citizens and understand their reactions.
How Swachhata Apps are utilized and analysed to improve various types of services.
This is not just the government's task of maintaining cleanliness.
However, every citizen and civil society association is also very responsible for maintaining cleanliness.
And I appeal to every citizen to participate in the Swachhta Survekshan in large numbers.
And make a solemn pledge that you don't fall prey to cleanliness in the city.
I am sure you must have had the habit of classifying dry waste and wet waste and you would have been using different waste hats like blue and green waste.
Reduce, Reuse and Recycling principles are very effective for waste management.
Clean cities will be ranked on the basis of this survey and if the population of our city is more than one lakh, then it should be our dream that if the population of our city is less than one lakh, then it should be the highest in the regional sequence.
And we should also make efforts.
And all of you should have a dream of 'Our City- Our Efforts', 'Our Progress of the Country'.
Let us make a solemn pledge that once again we should commemorate the revered Bapu and try to fulfil the resolution of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that are very small to see but if we look at them as a society then we become familiar.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
I was convinced that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj, she cannot go to 'Maharam' or her male Palakavina.
Specially, these bonds, rules are not in Islamic countries.
In India, however, only Muslim women did not have this right.
And I am very happy to mention here that our government should take care of it.
I have full faith, and I firmly believe that the journey of Indias development will continue to move forward on the strength of our women power, on the beliefs of their talent.
Therefore, our efforts should be made to ensure that our women also have equal rights and equal opportunities with men. And we need to move forward on the path of progress with women and men.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered with special significance.
This year, leaders of all ten ASEAN countries will be visiting India as Chief Guests.
This year, on the Republic Day, there will be not one but ten Chief Guests.
2017 has been specialised in both ASEANs country and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years in 2017 and Indias partnership with ASEAN completed 25 years in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to join these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, the day of festivals is going on and our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps no such day can be said that no festival is celebrated on that day.
May the coming New Year bring joy, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move ahead with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new joy and new resolve.
In the month of January, the festival of Makar Sankranti is being celebrated in the month of January, which is linked to nature.
In Rajasthan, Sankranti is called Magh-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals have special significance.
All these festivals are usually celebrated on 13th January 17th.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we will repeat this thing in 2018.
Indians will not be able to discover that there is no respect for them.
At that age, they are much bigger than all of us and are witnesses to the various phases of the country.
I had the privilege of communicating with Din on telephone before departing for a foreign trip.
It was a lovely interaction between us and our elder sisters in a small way.
I am not really talking about such personal interactions.
Listen, even after this change of life, Latadi is eager to do everything related to the country.
The spirit of satisfaction in their lives is linked to India's progress, it is linked to the changing India, it is linked to India that has scaled new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I am on a plane journey.
Lata ji: Good, good.
What to celebrate birthdays
And the accomplishment that we have achieved has been achieved through meditation and penance.
I don't really have anything.
Lata ji: Ho
Your letters are also available to me and I keep getting the gifts you sent me.
I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I can see how much work you are doing and how many things you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy because of your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: but I will soon join.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Our homes will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
This is called Deepawali darkness.
Most of these words are not just words but it is an order for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Whenever sweets, clothes and gifts come to our houses, we should go out for a moment.
Definitely do the job of giving outside to the needy things that are not used in our households.
In many cities, many such institutions work with the start-ups of young friends.
They collect clothes, cereals and food from the households of the people and discover them and deliver them to them.
The laughter grown on the faces of many poor families will double our joy of the festival, will shine on our faces, our lamps will be more shining and our lamps will shine even more.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi is welcomed in the traditional form of laxmi as a gift for good fortune and prosperity in Diwali.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this year
In our culture, girls have been considered as Lakshmi because girls bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organize this year's honourable programmes for girls in our society, villages and cities
Can we do this programme in Diwali this year for the honour of these Laxmis of India
There will be a lot of girls around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Someone would be doing the job of teaching poor children, someone would be doing the job of spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, someone would be serving the society by being a doctor or an engineer and a lawyer and trying to give justice to someone.
Our society should recognize such people, honour them and take pride in them.
Such a honour should be organised across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Share more information about the success of these girls through social media and use Bharat ki Laxmi Hashtag.
We had launched the Selfie with Daughter and it was spread all over the world. Similarly, this time we will also launch the mission of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
Promoting India's Laxmi Programme means empowering the nation and the nation's prosperity.
My dear countrymen, I had said behind me that Mann Ki Baat programme has a huge advantage that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect interaction with many familiar and unique persons.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayang, has sent me a leaflet and he has written in it.
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This year, when I got the results of my examination, some people asked me if you read the book Exam Warriors.
I told them that I have not read this book.
But again I bought this book and read it two or three times.
My experience after that was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination, I would have benefited a lot.
I believe that if you think about the new version of this book then you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers and some other labourers.
Thank you very much for reading and reading the book Exam Warriors twice or thrice.
My small friend has entrusted me with one thing and has instructed me to do something.
I will certainly follow our orders.
You have said that when a new version of this book comes, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and the teachers.
But I would urge you all to help me in this work.
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Tayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, through the newspapers, through television you are getting information about the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India.
However, you are aware that I am an ordinary person like you, an ordinary citizen. And that is why the impact of an ordinary life affects me in my life as well because I am also one of you.
Then I also heard that speech and also saw a confrontation.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by the Grand Slam winner and Emperor of Tennis World Rafael Nadal.
The audience present there enthusiastically welcomed him to speak.
He also appreciated Donald Livelihood Nadal for inspiring millions of youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the fight against indecision, he praised his competitive canal and set an example of sportspersonship in front of the world.
In fact, on the other hand, winner Nadal also praised Danil for his sporting performance.
There is a lot that every class and person of every age can learn.
These are moments, they are beyond winning or defeat, when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The thoughts of our ancestors were really commendable.
Mani Kanchan Sanyog: Janmayti Loksya Lochan Anandam means that when a person simultaneously possesses qualifications and humility, then who will not win a good heart
In fact, these young sportspersons have won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is really going to tell you for your good.
The debate will continue, the differences between the parties will persist, but if some things are stopped before they are spreading at a rapid pace then it will be of great benefit to them.
It becomes difficult to stop the things that are growing at a rapid pace and spreading frequently.
But in the beginning, if we get awakened and stop it then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel that today, especially my dear youngsters have something to say.
You all are aware that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit intoxication.
Because of the nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
Its consumption during adolescence has adverse effects on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that restrictions have been imposed on e-cigarettes in India recently.
E-cigarette is an electronic device different from regular cigarettes.
In cigarette because of hot nicotine rich liquid substance there is a kind of chemical smoke , through which nicotine is consumed .
We may be aware of the dangers of cigarettes often, but an illusion about e-cigarette has been shown that there is no danger due to e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are used in this so that its odour does not spread through other cigarettes .
We have seen around you that in many households there are chainsmokers but they prevent others from smoking at home.
E cigarette is different.
If someone smokes around us then he understands us from his habitat.
If there is a cigarette pocket in someone's pocket then also he gets to know from the pocket only.
However, it is not like this that many adolescents and youngsters can be seen roaming around with e-cigarettes in their books, in their pockets, in their pockets and in their pockets with pride and fashion statements.
Young generation is the future of the country.
The cigarettes have been banned so that these types of intoxication cannot be destroyed by our youth.
These restrictions have been laid so that the dreams of the family can not be saved from being destroyed, the lives of the children should not be deprived of the country, the habit of addiction should not spread to the society.
I urge you all to quit this addiction of tobacco and do not take any precautions about e-cigarettes .
Let us together build a healthy India.
You remember Fit India, don't you
Fit India does not mean that we should go to the gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
For Fit India, we have to stay away from all these addictions.
My dear brothers and sisters, Our country has been the birthplace and workplace of many exceptional people who have spent their lives for the welfare of the country and others.
India is the birthplace of many exceptional people, workplace and these are the people who have sacrificed their lives not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others.
A similar person will be honored in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will proclaim Mary Thresia as the Saint on October 13.
The work that Mr. Mary Thresia has done for the welfare of mankind in just 50 years of her young life is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very fond of social service and education.
He set up several schools, lodges and orphanages.
They have set up the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling their values and missions.
Once again I pay my homage to Mr. Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Krishi brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not for the whole of India but for the whole world that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single use plastic.
Looking at the leadership that India has taken in the direction of environmental protection, the views of countries around the world are now being applied to India.
I am confident that all of you will participate in the drive to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way but a young man from our country has started a mission in a unique way.
When I noticed their work, I interacted with them on telephone and tried to understand their new experiments.
Perhaps the interaction with them will help some other people of the country.
Shri Ripudaman Bewaliji is making a unique effort.
When I first heard the word Plogging, it was also new to me.
You are organising this programme in an innovative way and especially in a manner that the youth likes.
I congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart.
Friends, This year, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of respected Bapu.
Two kilometer plugging on October 2.
This programme will be organized across the country.
We have heard from the experience of repayment of the programmes, programmes and programmes.
Through this campaign, awareness about cleanliness along with public awareness about health is also increasing among the people.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step towards eliminating single use plastic, then India will move up 130 crore steps at a time.
Rupudman ji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you, to your team and to your innovation.
I would like to tell you something about one thing.
In fact, I would like to elaborate on the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, but today I am telling you that we should get the opportunity to prepare.
You must remember that on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is being celebrated.
So we should start preparations for that right now.
I will talk about it in detail but it is still time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can be formulated.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit fifteen places in India.
Programme at least fifteen places and intermittent nights.
Let us see, understand and experience India.
We have so much variety.
And when people come on vacations on the occasion of Diwali then they definitely go to tour. So I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, now on 27th September, the World Tourism Day was celebrated and some of the responsible institutions of the world present the tourism scenario and you will be happy to know that India has improved in the competitive index of tourism.
And all this has become possible due to the cooperation of all of us, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we do more, we will certainly be able to get top positions in the world's main tourist destinations when we complete 75 years of our independence.
There should be happiness and enthusiasm too.
Our festivals are celebrated collectively, celebrated together so that we also get culture from this collectiveity, we get a new strength of collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
Vijay Karnataka Newspaper of Times Group launched an initiative, in which he urged the children to send a letter to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if he gives more information about nature to the children, he will help in protecting the environment in the future.
Laxmeshwara's daughter Rida Nadaf has written that she is the daughter of a soldier in the army and she feels proud of it.
Wouldn't any Indian feel proud of the army personnel
And you are the youngster, it is quite natural to feel proud.
Irfana Begum from Kalaburagi has said that her school is 5 kilometers away from her village, so she has to leave early and she is also late to return home.
Therefore, they cannot play much with their friends, they should have schools near their homes.
My countrymen, I got the opportunity to take this kind of initiative by taking the initiative of a newspaper and I got the opportunity to save those letters.
It was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, on this very day, the Constituent Assembly adopted the event of India.
The implementation of the Constitution began on 26th January, 1950 and therefore, we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to recall the members of the Constitution.
He worked hard for nearly three years to create a Constitution.
No field in life, no matter whatsoever in nature has changed.
Equality and sensitivity for all are the hallmarks of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the letter of our Constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators, everyone should behave in accordance with the Constitution.
This is the message of the Rajya Sabha that no one should be harmed.
The Mussooda Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of that committee.
He played a very big role.
He said that the welfare of every section of society will be ensured.
On 6th December, we remember him on his Mahaparinirvana.
Baba Saheb has played a very big role in empowering and prospering the country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the 15th of December.
Sardar Patel, who made the identity of the farmer from son to iron, also did extraordinary work to build the country in a common thread.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constitution.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
But the country cannot forget that even nine years ago, on 26-11 days, there was a terrorist attack in Mumbai.
I remember the brave civilians, police and security guards who lost their lives today.
The nation will never forget their sacrifices.
It has become efficient to destroy human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social structure.
And that is why the need of the hour is to be more aware of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we will celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy protects our maritime shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Be it the Indus river or the Ganges or the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and seas are both economically and strategically important.
These are the gateways for the entire world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the navy of the king was counted among the most capable ships during the Mass Community.
In the expansion of the Mass Empire, he was supposed to be his navy in naming the Empire as the Economic General at that time.
Several examples of marble naval missions and research journeys are still available in confluence literature.
Most of the ships around the world have been allowed to join women in a very short span of time.
However, even during the Mass Communications Navy, 800-900 years ago, women had performed the Mass Community.
The women were also involved in the war.
Marshal rulers had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can we forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his navy when the Navy is mentioned
The territory of Konkan having a maritime heritage was included in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts related to Shivaji Maharaj - Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurga - were either in the coastal areas or in the sea.
Marathas navy protected these forts.
The Marathas comprised large and small boats.
Their navy was capable of attacking any enemy and defending themselves from the attack.
It is impossible to discuss Maratha Armaan and not mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new grandeur to the Marathas, and set up the Maratha Sainiks base at many places.
Even after Independence, the Indian Navy has gained valour many times.
Whether it is the Goa Freedom Struggle or the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War.
The INS Sumitra of his navy helped in quick rescue and delivered several fishermen safely out of the water to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three boats of our ship immediately reached there and they helped the government and the people there.
The warship INS Katiyal of our navy had humanitarian assistance in Rohingya in Bangladesh.
In June, the Papua New Guinea government gave us the SOS message and assisted our navy to save the fishermen on their fishing boats.
The INS Trikand of our navy also flew to warships during a merchant cyclone attack on a merchant ship in the West Galf on 21 November.
This year, the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special drive from 1st to 7th December.
Throughout the week, small children, big boys, everyone should flag off the national flag.
There should be a movement to shower respect for the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
Anyone in our acquaintance can post their experiences, their courageous actions, their paintings and photographs at the armedforcesflagday.
Invite people of the army in schools, colleges and invite them to know more about the army's work.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the army.
This is also an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all the soldiers of our defence forces.
The fund is utilized by the Sainik Welfare Board for the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of martyrs and injured soldiers in the war.
Let us also contribute to the morale of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
We should also bear the responsibility for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is World Soil Day.
I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters too.
Soil is an important component of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How fast is life
This was discussed a long time ago in our culture and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil from a long time ago.
In our culture, the feeling of devotion to agriculture, soil and respect must have been very natural in the minds of the people. And with the use of many scientific methods, soil was also being nurtured.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, two things have a great significance, we will be able to take care of our soil with devotion and scientific perspective.
We all feel proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are also aware of modern sciences and use them in agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj block and the farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used chemical fertilizers in an unbalanced manner so that the quality of soil was lowered.
Production was declining, thereby reducing the income of the farmers and also reducing the productivity of soil.
Some awakened farmers of the village were aware of the seriousness of the situation and after that the farmers of the village examined their soil, they acknowledged the amount of fertilizers, nutrients and organic fertilizers that they were advised to use.
You will be surprised to know that the information given to the farmers through the Soil Health Card has a positive impact on the implementation of the guidance given to the farmers.
In Rabi 2016-17, wheat production increased by one to three times and income also increased by one to four thousand rupees.
If we take care of the crops then we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the mother dam then it will also take care of us.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have prepared soil health cards so that they can get better information about their soil and sow their crops.
We worship Mother Dam, however, however, did we think about how dangerous the health of this damp mother is like a urea
More than necessary urea causes damage to the ground, it has been proved by many scientific experiments.
The farmer is the son of this dam Maa, how can he make his mother sick
It is the need of the hour to revive this relationship between mother and son.
Whether our farmers can make a solemn pledge to utilise the urea for our farming by 2022 that will mark 75 years of our independence
Once the sons of Damish mothers and farmers made a pledge that the health of the land will improve rapidly and the production will also increase.
There will be a change in the lives of the farmers in the true sense.
Now we have started experiencing global temperatures, climate change.
There was a time when winters started before Diwali.
Now after December it is a hustle-bustle and extremely cold is going on.
It is our experience that the winter is not coming out of the throne.
However, even in such a weather, people who are aware work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But the determination and determination were greater and stronger than all of them.
The eight-year-old son could not speak, but he took the support of the Shitti.
When he got up at 5 in the morning, he used to go to the house of the village and ask him not to go out in the open.
This potter village became Open Defecation Free due to the efforts of this child who taught cleanliness by visiting at least 30-40 households everyday.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today, they are performing well in every sphere.
Be it sports or competitions or social initiatives, our disabled people are not lagging behind in any case.
You must be recalling that in the Rio Olympics, our Divyang sportspersons had earned 4 medals with excellent sports and they also won the T-Twenty cricket of the blind.
There are several types of competitions going on across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Water Conservation Competition was organised in Udaipur.
In 80 of his body there are no muscles, but look at his patience, determination and hard work.
He also won a gold medal in the 70th National Para Water Contest, which led to the selection of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) for 20-20 Paralympics.
32 Para water conservators will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to young Jigar Thakkar.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born on this day.
I extend my warm greetings to all my fellow citizens and hope that this festival of Eid will give us a new inspiration, new energy and new resolve to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am talking to Neeraj Singh from Kanpur.
I would like to urge you to once again tell us the best ten things that you have talked about through Mann Ki Baat throughout the year so that we can recall them and we can learn more new things.
You have made a very good suggestion.
After listening to your speech, I would like to take a lot more into it and change it.
The old people who live in our villages always tell us, forget the sorrows and do not forget the happiness.
Whether it is a photo, a small story or a small television or a small television, I invite you to welcome 2018 in a good atmosphere, to do it with good memories, to do it with positive thoughts.
Share positive things on NarendraModi App, MyGov or on social media.
Give a boost to the events that inspire others.
We all see the strength of these collective efforts and its impact.
In the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely try to reach out to the countrymen on the Positive India Hashtag Positive India.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with all of you for Mann Ki Baat next month.
There will be a lot of opportunities to talk about.
Many thanks
Celebrated six days after Deepavali is one of the most sincere celebrations of our country.
In which traditional rules ranging from food to dressing were followed.
The unparalleled festival of Chhath Puja is completely linked to the worship of nature and nature.
Sun and water are the centres of sixth sermons, while bamboo and earthen utensils and mud are useful materials for this worship.
Dunia worships Ugwati, but in Chhathupuja, she also commemorates her prayers.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Cleanliness of the entire house before Chhathpuja, along with the cleanliness of the rivers, ponds, shores and shores, all the people are very enthusiastic.
Suryavanandana or Chhath Puja - Mountaineering is a festival of protection, prevention and discipline.
Normally, we can find that there is a lack of food, this feeling of inferiority
However, in Chhathupujya, after half of the morning, after eating prasad, this is a special tradition.
This is the reason that the ego gets destroyed and the ego is such a feeling that it hinders the progress of the individual.
It is very natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has been built in 100 per cent seminar with the people of the country.
Take Khadi and Handloom examples.
I would always urge Gandhi Jayanti for handloom, Khadi and you will be happy to know what is the result.
I was told that on the 17th of October this month, on the day of Dhantriya, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore 20 lakh was recorded at Khadi Village Industries Building Store in Delhi.
You might be happy to know that Khadi and Handloom are being sold at such a large scale from the same store.
During Deepawali, sales in Khadi's Gift Kupan have grown by nearly 680.
The sale of Khadi and Handicrafts products also showed an increase of nearly 90 this year as compared to last year.
Today, youngsters, elderly people, women, people of every age group like Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine the benefits of this business to the weavers, the poor families and the families working on handlooms.
However, from the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion are now replaced by Khadi for Transformation.
Khadi becomes a tool for the poorest of the poor by bringing about changes in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the village industry.
Shri Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he would like to know about the experiences of my security forces and to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shri Tejas Gaikwad has also asked the Narendra Modi App whether arrangements can be made to provide sweets to our security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali also brought a special experience for me.
I respect every soldier of the security forces with all the countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of the security forces who fought against the odds and odds of the border.
When we get time, when we get time, we should understand the experiences of the soldiers and listen to their glory.
Many of you don't know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also taking important roles in world peace.
Everyone is aware of the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace throughout the world and their positive landscape.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is my family in the world.
With this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives since its inception.
You all are aware of the fact that India's declining proposal and UN Charter's proposal were started in both words Woody the People.
India has always emphasized on women equality and the UN declaration on human rights is a living example of that.
All Main R. Borne Free and Equal, which was promoted in his Initial Frame, was replaced by the efforts of India's representative Hansa Mehta and later accepted the All Human Beings R Borne Free and Equality.
It was a small change, but a powerful thought was observed in it.
India's role in UN Peacekeeping Operations is what India has contributed to.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in the UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Presently, seven thousand soldiers were added to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
This peace effort has been made in some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, 20,000 patients were treated in the Indian Army Hospital and saved countless people.
Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also won the hearts of those people.
Indian women have also played an important role in building peace.
India is the only country that very few people know that India will send women police units to Library in the Peace Campaign.
And this step of India will inspire the nations of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to know that India's role is not only related to the peacekeeping mission, but also in 85 countries.
Our ex-servicemen from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peace Campaign, this is not an easy task.
Our security guards had to work in remote areas.
His memory blossoms the pride of every countryman.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was honored with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji created a unique identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, in the 72nd year, he was appointed as a Force Commander for Operations in Namibia and he served the country for ensuring independence.
General Themaiya, who was the Chief of the Army Staff, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and embraced the peace process.
As a peace ambassador, India always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone should move ahead with the vision of peace, goodwill and a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our land of reverence has been decorated with such great personalities who have served humanity for their own sake.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Sister Nivedita, is also one of these extraordinary people.
He was born in Ireland as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
Pendit means fully dedicated
Later, he proved himself to be in accordance with the name.
Yesterday, the 150th birth anniversary of Shri Nivedita.
The work of Swami Vivekanand Ji was so impressed that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was very distressed by the atrocities in the British Raj.
Not only did the British make our country a rose, but they also tried to make us a psychological rose.
Our culture has always been less inferior to our inferiority complex.
Sister Nivedita ji re-established the glory of Indian culture.
He said that people should unite by creating a national consciousness.
He went to various countries across the world and raised his voice against anti-socialism and philosophy.
Famous nationalists and Tamil poets Subramanian Bharati, our revolutionary poems are famous for Pudumari Penn, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It was believed that his inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita Ji also assisted the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Through our writings and conferences, Basu helped in research and propagation.
It is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are the best examples of this.
In 1899, there was a black plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
Sister Nivedita did not take care of her health and started the work of cleaning the roads.
She was such a woman who could lead a comfortable life but she was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from them and helped them in their service.
He taught people about cleanliness and service in their work.
On his monument, Shri Nivedita Hu Gave is relaxing every all to India, who has given her all to India.
No doubt, they have done the same.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
They are the heroes of building a New India.
Our anxiety is going on at a very young age and it is going on at the last stage of life that they are also seen in small kids.
Even youngsters used to suffer such diseases with exceptions.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorders .
In the youth, there should be such diseases that are less physical activity and changes in food habits.
Societies and families need to pay attention to these things.
When we think about it, we will realise that there is no need to move forward.
There is only a need to change our habits by routinely changing our habits.
Instead of going to Lifton, you should adopt the habit of climbing the jinna.
After dinner, the entire family should try to go with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in embracing a lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders.
The unique feature of Yoga for 30 minutes before school is that Yoga is easy and universal.
And I would like to say that Yoga can easily be done by a person of any age group.
It can be easily learnt about the simple methods and it can be done in every possible way.
There is no need for special resources and ground for this.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the field of sports in the past few days.
Our sportspersons have brightened the country in different fields.
India won the Asia Cup hockey trophy in hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best and on this strength, India became the Asia Cup champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India had become Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to these hockey teams and their teams from across the country.
After Hockey, there is a Changla report in Badminton too.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the Denmark Open Trophy for the countrys pride.
This is his third Super Series Premiere Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, Friends, FIFA Under Saventin World Cup was organized this month.
Many associations from across the world came to India and showcased their skills on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to face a fight.
Sportspersons were enthusiastic.
This big event of the World Cup, the whole world was watching us.
I was glad to see such a huge fight and the energy, enthusiasm and enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
The World Cup was successful and all the associations performed the best.
Even though India did not get a cup, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of all.
All the worlds including India have enjoyed this festival of sports and this entire competition has become thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
There are indications that the future of football is bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, I will have to do the Mann Ki Baat programme everyday to justify the emotions of the people who have written about Swachh Bharat.
Some young children send photos of their efforts and some youngsters are in it.
If there is a story of a new initiative related to cleanliness, then there is a news of changes in the zeal of an officer.
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report, in which there is a narrative of the law in the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
At the same time, a voluntary organization called the Eco-protection Organization (EPO) launched the Swachhta Abhiyan at the Chandrapur Fort.
In the campaign that lasted for two hundred days, people did not stop or get tired, they did the work of cleaning the fort.
I was enchanted to see the photos. Anyone who sees this photo, who has despaired of the surrounding cleanliness in his mind, would have felt that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled. I would like to tell my people that you can see the pictures of the youth of the Ecosystem Protection Organization, the sufferings they have taken, the image of Umadevi and their resolve.
It will change our frustration by looking at it.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
Guru Nanak Devji is not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Jagadguru.
He spoke of the well-being of the entire humanity, and addressed all the communities as equals.
He emphasized on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28,000 kilometers and during this journey he taught the truth of humanity.
He interacted with the people, and showed the path of truth, sacrifice and devotion.
He conveyed the message of social equality and showed this lesson not only by speaking, but by doing his work.
They started anchoring and it created a sense of service among the people.
The spirit of unity and equality among the people was awakened by the consumption of food sitting together.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of meaningful life - Remember the supreme spirit, work hard, work and assist whenever needed.
Guru Nanak Devji created Gurbani to tell his elements.
In 2019, we will celebrate the 55th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us strive on the path of their message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation of an integral modern India.
Today we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The characteristic of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was not merely a transformative idea, but he was bent on finding practical solutions from complex problems to achieve that.
He was skilled in realizing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel made India a hub.
It is ensured that crores of Indians can be brought under the umbrella of one nation and one Constitution.
He empowered his decision-making to overcome all odds.
They respected wherever they needed to be respected.
Wherever there was a need to use force, they used force.
He set a goal and resolved with that goal.
Only he could do the job of keeping the country together.
He dreamt of a nation where all the people would be equal.
I believe that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels ideas are always inspiring.
He had said, "No discrimination of caste can stop us, all are daughters of India, we should love our country and we should create a future on mutual love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and convergent for our Vision of New India.
And his birth anniversary was celebrated as the National Unity Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
Dear countrymen, after Diwali holidays, with a new resolve and with a new resolve, all of you must have come to your daily lives.
My best wishes to Deshbandhan for all his dreams.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Through All India Radio, Mann Ki Baat has completed three years.
Today it is the 36th part.
Most of them inspire me.
There are a lot of things to reform the government.
There are also some personal grievances.
I take half an hour every month but people keep sending their messages on Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
As a result, the government has also got sensitivity.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is an unforgettable journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time I have got the opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of the common man of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say that non-governmental, non-governmental mushrooms are effective.
This thing has been kept away from the political colors and instead of being distracted in the subject that has been distracted at that time, instead of being distracted, we have tried to connect with us with a stable mind.
I am aware that after three years, social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this idea will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should not go there while eating, we should take as much as we need, we need to worry about food being eaten.
After that I saw a large number of letters from every nook and corner of the country.
Several social organisations, many youngsters have already been working on it.
I came to know that there are many people who are working to bring together the food that is being supplied to it.
Once I saw the Selfie with Daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I told them in Mann Ki Baat.
Well, not only in India but also in the whole world, a big campaign of self-discipline has started.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This event has created a new self-confidence, a new pride for each of us.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people going outside that wherever you go on the topic of 'Incredible India', you send photos of that place and millions of photographs have come.
It has come from every nook and corner of India and in a way it is a big achievement for the people working in the tourism sector.
Mann Ki Baat has made me realize how a small event can create a massive movement.
I was thinking that Mann Ki Baat had started for three years. At that time several incidents of the last three years have touched my heart.
Every minute it is being considered to go the right path of the country.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the other, for the betterment of the society, for the progress of the country.
I have understood, understood and learnt from the countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I bow down to the countrymen from the bottom.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
Once again I would like to urge you to continue with the Khadi campaign that has started.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with this feeling that we will burn the lamps of Deepawali in the houses of the poor.
This work will give strength to the poor of our country and that is why we should do this thing.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance production capacity, how to handle solar energy
We are thinking about how we can revive the old 20-20, 25-25 and 30-30 years of shutdown.
Now the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been associated with it.
Many people were provided new employment opportunities.
In Pampore, Kashmir, Khadi and Village Industries have started their training centres once again and there is a lot to contribute to this region.
Now with the resumption of this training centre, it is going to help in modernizing the new generation, weaving clothes and inclusion of new things.
People have also started giving Khadi goods while visiting each other.
It will connect people with cleanliness.
Our respected President started this work and the entire nation participated in it.
Be it the elderly, the men or women or the cities or the villages, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
When I say that Sankalp se Siddhi, we all see how this cleanliness drive is moving towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts this movement, cooperates and contributes something or the other to realize it.
I express my gratitude to the Honble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it as its work.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programmes and I have seen that some people are continuously working and the results will continue to work till now.
There is one thing that we should clean up somewhere, the other thing is that we should not be aware of cleanliness, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then a ideological movement is also needed.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign has witnessed a series of competitions.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children took out pictures.
Using his ideas, he took out pictures on the subject of cleanliness.
Several people wrote poetry and in these days, I also post the pictures that our child friends and young boys have sent in social media.
I never forget to thank the people of the media when it comes to cleanliness.
These people have taken this movement forward in a very good manner.
They are also leading the Swachhta movement in their own way.
We can see how much electronic media and print media can serve the country in this Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days ago, some of my friends had taken note of the fact that a 18-year-old young man from Srinagar was Bill Dar.
No, there is nothing like that.
Bill Dar has been working for cleanliness for the last five-two and a half years from the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest pond in Asia is near Srinagar, be it plastic, polyethylene, polythene or waste or dirt, if it is dirty then it cleanses the pond.
Bill Dar is younger than his age, but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that future history is born out of the womb of history and when it comes to history, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is on the 11th of October, the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and on 25th September is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and was engaged in the work of Gramodaya. It is very natural to have respect for the work of his village when he is celebrating his centenary year.
Abdul Kalam ji used to talk about Nanaji Deshmukhs rural development during his interaction with the youngsters.
He used to mention Nanajis work with great respect and he himself went to the villages to see Nanajis work.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji, like Mahatma Gandhi, spoke of the last person in the society.
Sardar Saheb had brought the whole country together.
Now we should also move ahead with the mantra of unity.
We simply say that unity in diversity is the characteristic of India.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen of India that especially to my younger generation, we are awakening.
There are summer vacations, Diwali days, it is going to go out somewhere in our country.
People go out for tourism and it is very natural.
However, sometimes it is a matter of concern that our people dont see our country, they dont know the diversity of the country.
You must go to the outside country, I don't oppose it, but should you ever visit the places of your country
Looking at the lives of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, one more thing is that when all these people visited India, they took a look at India and at the same time they used to live for India and they got a new inspiration to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had made extensive visits to India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand India.
The value addition in tourism will be such that when we do not go to the top of our beloved son-in-law, we become a student and we try to understand his life.
I have got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four and a half hundred districts. And today, when I take care of this great responsibility in India, I am feeling a lot of confusion.
It does not take time at all.
I urge all of you that in this vast India, there is not just a declaration of unity in diversity, it is a repository of our unconventional strength.
There are many types of food habits in our country .
Even if we keep eating a new substance throughout our life, there are so many types that the first thing will not come again.
Now, this is a big strength for our tourism.
I am sure that even if you go out somewhere during this time, you will carry forward my first mission.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you meet the people there, send them photographs.
I have an idea that what can be the seven best tourist destinations in our state to promote tourism in India, every Indian should know about the seven special places in our state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we know something about these places
Can we make this information available on Narendra Modi App
Can we know about Hashtag Incredible India
Just imagine, if all the people of a state start giving such good information then I will tell the government that they should snatch the information that has come from every state and prepare a literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
This means that how can tourist places be encouraged in a way by the peoples intentions
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
From this month of October to March, you can also become a major and important partner in promoting tourism in the country.
I am inviting you for that.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
There is a rift in my mind.
Something on my mind goes awkward.
In the end, I am a human being like you.
The Indian Army has been awarded two brave as Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
As a matter of extraordinary reason, both Swati and Nidhi were martyred while serving Mother India.
You can imagine that if the processor gets damaged at such a young age, then what will be the state of mind
However, Swati Mahadik, wife of Shahid Karnal Santosh Mahadik, decided to face this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He completed his training for 11 months with hard work and spent his life to fulfil the dream of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dubey was acting as a hero in the army and became a martyr in the motherland.
So his wife Nidhi decided that we should be recruited in the army and they have fulfilled their determination.
It is natural for every countryman to respect these brave hearts of our mothers and sisters.
I heartily congratulate these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, during the festival of Navratri and Diwali, there has been a great opportunity for the youth of the country.
Our country is celebrating this year's FIFA World Cup under 17 years.
I believe that I will have to hear the soccer announcement all around.
Generations in each age will grow interest in football.
It will not be possible to see our youngsters playing in the fields of schools and colleges in India.
Well, the entire world is coming to play on the soil of India, so that we can make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navratri festival is going on.
There is a time of worship of Mother Durga .
How the entire atmosphere is filled with sacred aroma .
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the entire nation celebrates festivals, on the other hand, when there is a news of violence from any part of India then it is natural for the country to worry about it, this is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
Sardar Patel is a country that brings his life to the country's hearing.
Our ancestors of generations have accepted the values of public life, the values of non-violence with equal respect.
We have been listening to non-violence, supreme religion since childhood.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be carried out in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief or belief in political ideology, be it faith in the individual or belief in the tradition or belief in the name of faith, nobody has the right to take law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the countrymen that laws will be taken, those people who suppress the path of violence or groups will never tolerate this country and no government will tolerate it.
Everyone will have to bow before the law.
Because there is a cultural tradition of thousands of years, if we look at cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events then perhaps there will not be a single day in 365 days that will remain untouched.
Now you must have seen that our festivals are going on according to the cycle of nature .
There is a simple relationship with nature .
Most of our festivals are connected to the farmers.
First of all, I would like to call you "Michami Dukkadam".
Yesterday, the festival of Sansatsari was celebrated in Jain society.
In Jain society a festival is organized in the month of Bhadrama .
On the last day of the auspicious festival, there is a festival day.
This is a unique tradition .
The day of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also gets frozen on the day of Kama-Vani and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other ' Dukkadam ' .
We have heard these things and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say - forgiveness is the speciality of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama the importance of compassion in The Marchant of Venice, "Marcy is two blest, "With blesset the him that gives and him that takes forgiveness and whoever has been forgiven, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great joy in every corner of the country.
It is natural to speak on the Ganesh Festival when the subject of Ganesh Chaturthi comes up .
The festival of Ganesh-Chaturthi is celebrated for ten days.
This Mahasan is considered a symbol of unity, equality and goodwill.
Ganeshotsav greetings to all fellow countrymen.
Recently, the festival of Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the most prestigious festivals of Kerala in various parts of India.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
At present these festivals are seen to be the cause of attraction for tourism .
I would like to tell my countrymen that like Navratri festival in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way.
Besides, our other festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
In the series of these festivals, Id-ul-uha festival will be celebrated across the country within a few days.
Id-ul-uha greetings to all my countrymen.
The festival is a symbol of faith and belief for us.
Our New India is going to reflect cleanliness.
In family life, festivals are associated with cleanliness.
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it needs to be a social nature.
Cleanliness should become an integral part of our country, not just in the house, in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernisation is changing.
A big campaign called Eco-friendly Ganapati has been launched.
If you look at YouTube then the daughters of every household are making Ganapati by bringing the soil.
Somebody is painting vegetables, somebody is sticking to paper pieces.
Different types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
And it seems rare when we know new experiments.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
Toilet power has reached nearly 67 per cent from 39 per cent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood was less then dirt was spread everywhere .
Workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhaner, Banaskantha district of Gujarat performed 22 temples and 3 mosques in a sequential manner.
Automatic sweat broke out, all the people came out.
Excellent examples of unity for cleanliness, inspiring examples, were given by all the activists of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.
We have dedicated ourselves to cleanliness and if it becomes our sustainable spirit then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I challenge all of you that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, when I used to say: 'Swachhta Hi Seva', 'Swachhta Hi Seva', 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
Create a clean environment throughout the country.
We should explore opportunities whenever we get the opportunity.
But we all come together.
On holidays or Sundays we will come together and work together .
We will go to the neighbourhood settlements but we will work with a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social and cultural political leaders, government officials, collectors and Sarpanches to create an atmosphere of unprecedented cleanliness for 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.
In a department has been set up where after the construction of toilets you can write your name and the name of the family that you have helped.
My friends of social media can run some constructive campaigns and actually work on the lines of the world.
The campaign is being organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in the Swachh Sankalp Campaign, where essay competitions, short film making competitions, painting competitions are being organized.
In this we can write essays in different languages and there is no bond of age in them.
You can make short films with your mobile.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that will inspire for cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness campaign.
Once again, I would like to reiterate that on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti should take a pledge to commemorate Swachhta on 2nd October.
We took some steps for cleanliness.
Make a part of it by working yourself.
You see how the theme will shine on Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
You can imagine that it will be a pleasant pleasure to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, I specially want to accept our debt.
I would like to express my gratitude to you people not because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time, I would like to express my gratitude to you people for accepting the loans that millions of people have been connected to the country through Mann Ki Baat programme.
I get the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
I look forward to my message as eagerly as you look forward to Mann Ki Baat.
I am impatient because I get to learn something from all of you.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for your contribution.
We are connected to our mobile phones and we become a part of these wrong habits.
Prime Minister, I speak from Pune.
I would like to tell you about my friendship that he always tried to help the people but I was tired of seeing a habit of it.
I had gone to the shopping mall with him once.
We make payments at a very large place, but we conspire with our hardworking brothers and sisters and we disbelieve them.
Do we not think that there is always a relationship with the sellers, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, sometimes with the Otto rickshaw drivers, when we come in contact with those who are suffering, then we express our feelings to them.
Not only this, he wants to reduce the amount of two to five rupees and he wants to go to a big hotel and he doesn't even see the bill, he pays money.
The question for him is not of rupee but of how much pain his heart may be.
He is poor and hence he has doubted his honesty that there will not be a difference in your lives for two or five rupees.
Madam, I am grateful that you have given me a message by calling the heart touching phone.
I believe that even my countrymen will leave such behavior with the poor.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire nation is celebrating National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of great hockey player and magician of hockey Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey is incomparable.
I would like to recall this thing that I believe that we should connect with the new generation of sports in our country.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are young countries of the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical fitness, intellectual purity, emotional co-existence.
What do I think more than that
In a way, sports is a burden that connects the heart.
Our young generation should come forward in the field of sports. Today, in the age of computers, I want to tell you that sports are important from sports stations.
Playing FIFA on the computer but performing something on the outer field .
The joy of playing crickets on the open ground is different from the cricket on the computer .
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and ask their mothers that you would come home.
Today, the situation is such that when children come home and watch games or cartoon films on a mobile phone, then they have to ask their mother whether you are going to go out or not.
There was a time when the mother said to the child, 'You are such a time today that you will go out and go out
Our youngsters are happy to note that the FIFA World Cup is being organized under 17 years from 6th to 28th October.
Today, as I used to talk about sports, I would like to tell the people that the event that touched my heart last week.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl. Some of them were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes we spent 30-30 days in water, this is the first incident in the world with snow in the waves of the sea.
Who would be an Indian who would not be proud of impossible girls
I salute the daughters of these daughters and I asked them to share this experience with all the countrymen.
I am also going to provide a different place for Narendra Modi Power for his fondness.
Because you must read their experiences because it is an adventurous story, a story of self-respect and I am glad that these daughters have reached us.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we celebrate Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of the former President of our country, Dr.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Teachers have an important role in awakening creative emotions and knowledge among our students.
Can we make a solemn pledge when we celebrate Teachers' Day
I would like to guide everyone to make a solemn pledge for five years and after five years you will be able to enjoy yourself with the joy of fulfilling your solemn pledge.
There is an incident in the life of every teacher that his efforts would have changed due to changes in somebodys life.
If we make a collective effort then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana economic inclination is a matter of discussion not only of India but of the pundits of the entire world.
The scheme was started on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the scheme is being completed by three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been withdrawn.
Today I am happy that the poor people of the society have been made the part of the economy of the country.
Now an atmosphere of restraint has been created.
He feels that money will be used for children.
Some good things can be done in the future.
Moreover, if a poor person looks at RuPay card in his pocket then he feels like a saint, in his pocket there is a credit card, in my pocket there is RuPay card.
It feels comfortable.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the times to come and the insurance for the accounts that have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been distributed.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is one rupee, thirty rupees.
In many families, if something happens to the mainstream of the family due to an expenditure of one rupee then his family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Today is not enough time but I will tell the people of the bank to upload it to my gov. in.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all.
Thank you very much.
The human mind is such that he feels very charming in the rainy season.
Animals, birds, trees, nature - all are pleased with the arrival of monsoons.
However, this rain sometimes takes the form of a record and then it is realized that there is a great power to bring about destruction in water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes its terrible form in the natural calamities of floods and earthquakes is terrible.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing weather and the environment, they are also having a very negative effect.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in the states of Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
The flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Whether it is the soldiers of the army, the air force, the NDRF, the paramilitary forces or the army, all of them confront the service of the disaster during this period.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electrification and connectivity are all affected.
People are also telling their problems.
Gradually, we can also prepare timelines for our work according to the weather estimates, which can prevent potential losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing for it more than me.
I have received a lot of letters on the subject of GST, a lot of phone calls have been received and people are still expressing happiness and condolences about GST.
One of these phone calls will also be heard by you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I speak to Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST was launched in our country on the same date last month.
What kind of expectations have been made by the government about this decision and whether the results are available after one month or not
I would like to hear your thoughts about this.
It has been almost a month since GST came into force and its benefits are also visible.
If a poor person writes a letter to me about how the prices of essential items have come down due to GST then I feel very happy.
Initially, there was a fear of GST because it was not known, but now it is learnt about it, so it seems to be easier to work in the remote mountains of Ishaanya.
All these facilities are available, but they are also getting support for achieving economic momentum.
The speed at which this change has taken place smoothly, the speed at which it has been transformed, the speed at which it has been re-registered has created an atmosphere of confidence in the entire country.
Scholars in the field of economics, scholars in the field of management, experts in the field of technology will ever explore the use of Indias GST as an ideal system in the world.
It will become a hairstyle for many universities of the world.
It is a big step to successfully implement this tax in such a vast country with the participation of crores of people.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the States and the Centre.
As a result, every government has prioritized that GST should not burden the expenditure on the food grains of the poor.
You are well aware of the fact that what was the price of something before GST, what was the price of a new situation, all the information is available on the GST App on the mobile.
I sincerely congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments, all the central and state government employees for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a concept but a system that strengthens a new authentic culture.
In a way, it is also a mission to bring about social reform.
Once again I offer my heartfelt congratulations to crores of countrymen for the smooth functioning of such a big task.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, several such incidents have taken place in the month of August that are specially related to the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people would be aware that the slogan 'Leave India' was Dr.
Yusuf Meher Ali.
Your new generation should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What could be a bigger inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle in the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had made the country free from the British rule.
This was the time when every citizen of India, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, be it cities, be it educated or uneducated, be it poor or decent, had become a part of the uit India Movement.
Responsing to Mahatma Gandhi's call, millions of Indians were pushing their lives in a struggle with the mantra of 'Karo'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had quit their education and slit their books.
The great men like Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan played a key role.
Gandhijis two different forms are seen in both the 'Assistance Movement' and 'India uit India Movement' - 1920 and 1942.
The pattern of the Cooperation Movement was different and in the 42nd, such a situation arose so fast that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo Maro'.
It was the peoples support, the peoples power, the peoples resolve and the peoples struggle behind all these successes.
Sarah was fighting unitedly.
Sometimes I believe that the first freedom struggle of India was established in 1857 when we saw the leaves of history connected a little.
Starting from 1857, this freedom struggle was going on in some parts of the country by 1942.
This lengthy period awakened the spirit of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to something or the other in that direction.
Generations have changed but the pledges have not collapsed.
People used to come, they were connected, they went out, new people came and the country was making every effort to disturb the British rule.
Only five years would have been decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We became independent in 1947.
Today, the year 2017 is going on.
The incident took about 70 years.
The governments came and grew in time.
Arrangements have been made, changed, changed and increased.
Everyone has tried their best to make the country problem free.
Efforts have been made to increase the employment of the country and to remove poverty.
Pain was also raised in your own way.
Success was also achieved.
He added that heights are also higher.
For example, from 1942 to 1947, it was five years of resolution.
Similarly, I see that the five-year period from 2017 to 2022 is now in front of you.
Let us celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as a solemn pledge, and when we complete 75 years of our Independence in 2022, we will fulfill that pledge.
Today, it is not the announcement of 'Karenge ki Marenge' but it is the resolve of a New India, it is a matter of great satisfaction and achieving success.
We want to live and fight with this resolution.
On 9th August this year, I will run a grand campaign from the resolution to its achievement.
Every Indian, social institutions, local systems, schools, colleges, different organisations, everybody should make a new resolve for New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will become a part of this solemn pledge and today we will not be anywhere else but we will definitely be online.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially those coming to the online world, to come forward to contribute in their innovative ways in the creation of a New India.
Use technology to take up all these things like video, post, blog, eyes, innovative ideas.
May this mission become a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be launched for young friends on the NarendraModiApp.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread it on a wide scale.
My dear countrymen, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort as a Prime Minister of India on 15th August.
I am only on the occasion.
Send your views on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to get this idea in the time I get it on 15th August.
During the last three years, I have received a complaint about my 15th August address that my speech is a little longer.
I will complete it in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economics in the economy of India.
And that economics has never been written down.
Our festivals are not just a matter of joy and happiness.
Our festivals are also the medium of social reform.
At the same time, every festival of yours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganeshotsav after that, the fourth moon after that, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja and Diwali will be celebrated in one place and this is the time when the poor gets the opportunity to connect their economies.
And a natural joy mixes in these festivals.
And if we talk about the economy then several months before the festival of Rakhi, hundreds of families start making supplies through small and medium enterprises.
Nowadays people are getting more interested in homemade and household reservoirs.
The business of thousands and millions of people is linked to this festival.
It is directly related to those poor families who make small lamps of soil.
But today I would like to take up the issue of environment while talking about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals.
And they have urged me to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh Murthy in the context of Ganeshotsav so that people can imagine the idols of soil from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to these aware citizens.
They only urged me to discuss this topic beforehand.
This year's Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
I am sure that all of you will be connected with this solemn pledge.
And this will provide employment to the poor artisans and the poor artisans who make these idols.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, let us connect our festivals with the economy of the poor, let us enjoy our festivals as a festival of economic benefits for the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the coming festivals and festivals.
We feel proud and proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters demonstrated their sports with the Women Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
I felt very nice to talk to them, but I realized that there was a lot of bitterness in his mind that the World Cup did not win.
This trauma was visible on their faces.
I had a separate analysis of myself.
I said, "Look, today there is such a time of fame that the expectations are increased.
It is being increased so much that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations change in aspirations.
We have seen many such games in which the sportspersons of India are angry with the sportspersons.
Some people leave their limits and talk about things that are extremely painful.
But it was for the first time that even though our daughters did not win the world power, 125 crore Indians took the burden of defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the country.
Once again I congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters from the bottom of my heart.
Every citizen of the country should make a solemn pledge and every citizen of the country should make a solemn pledge in the next five years.
Let us move forward together, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
The summer was also very strong this year.
However, the monsoon rains have stopped in time and the following steps are being taken smoothly.
Heavy rains in many parts of the country have caused hazardous conditions.
In the last few days due to heavy rains, we have got relief from the scorching heat.
And all of you have seen that no matter how driven by life, no matter how tension, personal life or public life, the advent of rain changes our mindset.
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in many parts of the country today.
Now in some parts of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor of the country is connected with Lord Jagannath ji.
The people who came to Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been studied and he must have seen that he should admire the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath as it involves social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramadan was celebrated with a sacred spirit.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of of offering prayers.
It is a month of enjoyment and the more enjoyment you get, the more enjoyment you have.
Let us all come together and take inspiration from these holy festivals and take joy and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a very inspiring incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of about three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in those small villages. In a way, the population of the brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more.
During this Ramzan period, the villagers have decided to construct toilets together.
The government also provides assistance to these individual toilets and assisted them with an amount of about Rs. 17 lakhs.
You spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy day into the opportunity of the welfare of the society.
Their one thing is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, they made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
You are aware that three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people for completing this work.
Then somewhere that organ of the body or the mind falls.
This is also the subject of cleanliness.
These evil habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of it.
Everybody will have to pay attention.
A good inspirational event will be remembered again and again.
And Im happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is becoming a movement for the common man.
And the people sitting in the government also take this work forward with the participation of the people, it increases its strength several times.
Recently, an excellent event came to my notice, which I would like to tell you.
This is the incident in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken up a major task from the peoples participation.
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Build toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and administration have successfully completed 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages became Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate the people of the government, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district. They have set a very inspiring example of tireless hard work.
Prakash Tripathys awareness of democracy is admirable.
And democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
Awareness in the inner world is the price of liberation.
Regular awareness of democracy is essential and therefore we used to remember those things that had attacked democracy and moved forward towards the good things of democracy.
June 1975-25 was such a period that no democratic lover could forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into Turung.
The opponent tunes were pressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country, including Shri Jayprakash Narayan, were also present at the venue.
Even the judiciary was not able to escape from that terrible shadow of crisis.
Newspapers were made completely unemployed.
Today's journalistic students from all over the world, people working in democracy are constantly trying to increase awareness about democracy by remembering that black period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in Turunga.
When Aribani completed one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and described the situation in his poem.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world was composed of Yoga.
From the sea to the mountains, people used to welcome the sun rays in the morning and evening through yoga.
There would be no Indian who would not be proud of it.
Its not like that there was no practice of yoga before, but today when Yoga has been built in the threshold of the world, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
People performed Yoga at The Great Wall of China, China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the world heritage site of Machu-Pichu, Peru.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of IFEL tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different dimension to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Friendship Dam, the Salma Dam.
Yoga classes were organized with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people performed Yoga at one go and recorded a new world record.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time I will be fortunate to do Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers practiced Yoga in Siachen where they used to be 20, 25, 40 degrees Celsius.
Our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, ITBPs, CRPFs, all have made Yogasanas their heritage with their work.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this is the third International Day of Yoga, so I had said that three generations of my family should send their photographs of Yoga together.
Some television channels also took up this issue.
Several photographs have been sent to me, some of them have been collected on the NarendraModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to attend my favourite programme.
In Kerala, for the last few years, P.
N.
A good programme is organised through Panikar Pratishthan, and reading months are celebrated to make people aware about the habit of booking, reading public books.
Now I also remember what I had dealt with carefully.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we should not give floral tributes but we should give a book or welcome it by giving a handkerchief.
That too is Khadi's handkerchief so that Khadi can be encouraged.
When I was in Gujarat, we all had become habituated, but after coming here I had become habituated.
However, he went to Kerala and once again that habit became aware.
And now I have started informing the lower people in the government.
We can also gradually become the nature.
Pushpuguchchis lived very little.
Once I took it in my hand and I kept it there.
But if you give a book then you will become a part of your house, you will become a part of your family.
When I am talking about this thing then how historical values were there for such things.
Last year when I had gone to England, ueen Elizabeth of Britain had invited me to eat.
For many years, however, Rani Elizabeth has maintained the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was there, she showed me with great joy.
And when I was looking at it, he was urging me to touch it.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change every night, and whenever they say so, the vaccine becomes wealthy.
However, we have to say these things, we have to keep trying.
Now I cant say that if I go anywhere and someone offers me a floral gift then I will refuse it.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are many things to do.
I used to invest in files but I have developed a habit that I read a few letters from the letters I receive everyday and that is why I get the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters are written, different types of Manse are written.
Recently, I got a letter reading, I feel that I must tell you about that.
Arulmozhi Sarwan, a housewife from Madurai in Tamil Nadu, afar off South India, sent me a letter.
And what was happening then he wrote that he thought of taking some financial initiatives in his family keeping in mind the education of children etc. so that the family could get some financial help.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started working towards supplying some goods from the market.
I would like to tell the people of the country that you should also get the same opportunity so that the EPFO on the internet can also get the same opportunity.
There is a new kind of arrangement to visit GeM.
Whoever wants to supply the goods to the government, who wants to sell the bamboo, who wants to sell the bamboo, who wants to send the table, he can register his name on it.
All the departments of the government are watching the people who register under EEGM.
Without agents, many goods are available inexpensively.
The Arulmozhi Madamani Government has registered all the goods that they can provide on this website.
And it is a matter of great interest that the letters he wrote to me are very interesting.
He has written that once he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I wrote about what I could supply to E-GEM and I received orders from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what would be required by the Prime Minister's Office.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arulmozhi did not write letters to me, I wouldn't have noticed that in the e-GEM system, a housewife is working far and wide, its goods can be purchased from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-GeM
I want someone who wants to sell his goods to the government in such a way that he can add more and more to it.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maximum Governance are an excellent example of this and what is the goal - Minimum Price and Maximum Access, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can take pride in our success in space sciences.
And this is the uniqueness of India that if our feet are on the ground for Yoga, then our dreams are to overcome the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in sports and science too.
Today, India is pushing its address not only on the ground but also in space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Small Satellites, including Cartosat-2 Malicket satellite.
And in addition to India, these satellites included satellites from around 14 countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
And Indias Small Satellite Campaign will greatly help in the field of agriculture, in the field of natural disasters.
A few days ago, you would have noticed that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And it was the weightiest satellite in the satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
You can imagine how much our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June, the Mars mission was completed for 1,000 days.
You all would be aware that when we successfully got a place in the field for the Mars mission, the entire mission was for a period of six months.
I am sending photographs, information and scientific information but I have been working for more than a fixed life.
It is a matter of great importance for our space journey for our scientific journey to complete one thousand days.
We are also seeing that the performance of our youth is improving in the field of sports.
Recently, Indian badminton Kidambi Srikanth won the open competition in Indonesia and enhanced the country's pride.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his trainers for this victory.
A few days ago, I was fond of playing P.
T.
Usha got the opportunity to participate in the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
We will encourage sports as well as sports.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in holistic personality development is unusual.
There is no shortage of talented sportspersons in the country.
If the children of your family are fond of sports then they should be given opportunities.
They should not be moved from the field to the room and practiced.
They should also study and showcase their brilliant performances. But if they are fond of sports, then schools, colleges, families and surrounding people should strengthen them and encourage them.
Everyone has a dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year.
Just wait for the rain.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the auspicious occasion of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially the Muslim community on this auspicious month.
In Ramadan prayer , spirituality and Dan Dharma are given a lot of importance .
We are very fortunate in India that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can proud of this thing that we can proud of 1. 25 billion Indians that all the communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God.
There are people who worship the idol and there are people who oppose the statue.
Every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition is here, we have inspired the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion, sect, ideology or tradition, all these things give us the same message: peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely help in taking this path of peace, unity and harmony forward.
Once again I convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am very happy to say that many people have responded to it.
Individually, everyone showed me the enthusiasm to talk to me.
I have not read anything, I have not heard the message of everyone, so many things have come up.
But when we look at these messages then some people have tried to learn music, some people try to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, they are learning new languages.
Some people are learning pockets, some are learning dance, some are taking dramatics.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems.
Some people are trying to understand nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I would like to tell you a phone call.
"I speak Daksha Katyal.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I experienced how much struggle and sacrifices were being made for India's independence.
I was very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters and the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their lives for freedom in Turunga, several youths climbed the throne of fasci.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
You must have seen that in the freedom movement, the great men who laid down their lives during the time of independence did a great job of writing, studying and their writings also strengthened India's independence.
Just a few years ago, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar.
I had also visited the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book My Birthday in Turung.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were locked in small places.
The freedom fighters must have suffered.
When I read Savarkar's book My Birthday, it inspired me to see the Cellular Jail.
A television programme is also presented there which is very inspiring.
There will not be any such state in India, there will not be a single linguistic group in India, in which no one has spent his life in the Cellular Turunga, in the Turunga of Andaman, who had been punished for the sake of freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we have not seen.
If you are very tired then open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe in the fresh air, you get a new consciousness.
When we get in touch with those five great personalities who formed our bodies then there was a new consciousness in our body, a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this, but we never take care of it, we dont bind it in a single thread, in a formula.
You must see that when you get in touch with your natural condition, there will be a new consciousness within you.
And therefore, the global mission to be associated with the nature of 5th June should become our own mission.
We are getting some benefits from our ancestors protecting the environment.
If we protect the environment then it will benefit the future generations.
And if we look at Atharvaveda then it is the most guiding edition of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Bhumi: Sono Aham Prithviva.
The Vedas said that the purity that we have in us is due to the Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her son.
If we recall Lord Buddha then one thing is clearly visible that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all these three events have taken place under the trees.
But it needs to be pursued in modern words, with modern logic.
Through Yoga, we have connected the world with a formula.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, it brings together today.
Today's lifestyle is becoming difficult due to rushing and increasing responsibilities.
From a very young age, this stressful mind seems to be deteriorating.
Yoga has an important role to play in leading a stress-free life in such a time when medicines are being taken and the days are getting shattered.
Yoga is a way of ensuring health and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise.
If we want to experience an intermediate journey with the health of the body, mind and thought, then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders from all over the world.
Last year I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some bakis.
Gradually, the work will move forward in that direction.
I have received a suggestion and I congratulate the valuable vision providers.
It is a very psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga, and on this occasion, you should urge three generations of family to do Yoga together.
Aaji-azoba, i-baba, son-in-law-the-three generations should do yogasana together and upload their photographs.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will have such a beautiful breakthrough that will give Yoga a new dimension.
I am grateful to you for this idea. And I also feel that the way we had started the campaign of selfie with daughter and got a very interesting experience, similarly these three generations will be able to commemorate Yoga in the country and around the world.
You must send a collective picture of those three generations of people where three generations are performing Yoga. You must send it on NarendraModiApp and MyGov.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will be the photos that will ensure a golden future.
I invite you.
The International Day of Yoga is still a three-week drive.
In a way, it is a movement for health care.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
When you people entrusted me with the responsibility of your chief servant, when I got the opportunity to speak for the first time from the Red Fort on 15th August in my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on from different parts of India and I have noticed that where Modi is going, what Modi has done.
This is because I have received a very careful telephone call and I must have thought in the same way as they said.
But I am grateful to them for taking this thing into consideration.
You have also heard this telephone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi Ji TV and on social media, I always see that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people should collectively adopt cleanliness as a mission.
The elders are not only participants but also children are aware of cleanliness.
Small kids can often be seen stopping the roads from dirt.
The cleanliness drive that you have started from the ghats of Kashi has taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
You are really saying that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but in recent times there is also a festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before I reach there, seven days ago, ten days ago, a large number of cleanliness programmes are being organized.
Just a few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a huge cleanliness drive.
But I didn't know about these two things.
But after this telephone call, I thought it was true.
You can imagine how happy I might have noticed this thing. And the country too is imagining this thing in such a way.
What would be a matter of greater happiness for me than being associated with cleanliness with my visits
There is a habit of preparing for the rest for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness has become a key factor in it.
This thing is also enjoyable and inspiring for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagine it is very good but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that this movement should stand up and instead of giving a visit to some goods, memory, it is a good thing to be given a soft tonne of garbage from the cleanliness drive.
It will be a great humanity.
Once we started considering this waste as a wealth that many innovative methods of waste management will come forward.
Youth associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and new instruments.
The Government of India has decided to open a massive mission of waste management with the help of the governments of the states and the representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities will have similar tools to collect solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of garbage will be provided, one of them will be green and the other will be blue.
Two types of waste are made - one wet waste and the other dry waste.
These wastes will be stored in 4,000 cities and we will put dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste.
For example, the garbage that comes out of the kitchen, be it vegetable salts, roasted food, egg shields, papaya, this is all wet waste and put it in green waste.
Other types of wastes include paper, lips, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken bags, rubber, metal etc.
I am sure that we will develop such a culture and we will have to take a new step in the direction of cleanliness, then we will be able to fulfil the dream of cleanliness that Gandhiji has seen.
Today, I want to mention one thing with pride that even if one person decides on his mind, he can build a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such task.
For nearly 80-90 weeks, the Versova sea shores were transformed and thousands of tons of waste were wasted and today Versova beach has become clean and beautiful.
Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) had taken up the entire responsibility of this work.
Brothers and sisters, today I have been told with great pleasure that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Reasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Reasi Block, the administrators there, for setting an example for Jammu and Kashmir.
And I have also been told that the leadership of this entire movement was women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out a torch morch there for awareness and inspired people from homes and streets.
I congratulate those mothers and sisters from the bottom of my heart and congratulate the administrators of that place who have started the best by making a black hungry free on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, three years of the present government has been reviewed from the newspapers, TV channels and social media since last month-Pandhara.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
The tenure of these three years has been crossed every step.
People from all sections of the society have analyzed it.
Some of them have been praised, somebody has supported, some of them have registered some errors, I consider all these things important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have made critical and important reactions.
If there is light on errors and deficiencies then there is an opportunity to improve them.
It is essential for a conscious nation and a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and the impact of a good-white is similar to that of a common man.
It seems as if I have been interested in the things of the household sitting in the household.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, when we meet again, every nook and corner of the country must have reached the rains, the weather has changed, the results of the examinations may have come, the start of a new student life will be there and a new joy and fragrance will come along with the coming of the rains.
Let us all move ahead in such a way that we love nature.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, the innumerable contribution of the people who have lost their lives for the society, on the other hand, often the government is not being looked into.
Every time the information that comes to Mann Ki Baat, there was a detailed analysis in the government.
What are the types of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Normally, it has been found that the nature of man is to advise others.
If someone coughs while going to the bus then immediately come and ask him to do this.
Consultation , giving information as if something is in our nature .
Most of them are those who provide information, they are those people who are trying to reach me who really do something or the other in their lives.
And when I came to know about this, I realized that these are not general information but they are talking about it.
Some people also do this because they feel that if they listen to the ideas where they are working, if they get a broader form then many people can benefit from it.
Therefore, they have a natural desire to mention it in Mann Ki Baat, all these things are very positive in my view.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the people who are mostly deserving of information, who do something or the other for the society.
Not only this, when I mention something then I feel very happy to know something like this.
Last time some people in Mann Ki Baat had informed me about food and expressed concern about it and I had mentioned it.
And after that, many people from every nook and corner of the country used to use innovative ideas on the NarendraModiApp.
I have never thought that today, especially the younger generation in our country has been doing this thing for many years.
We have been listening to some social institutions for the past few years. However, the youth of my country have been involved in this work.
Many have sent me videos.
There are several places where there is a bank of poultry.
People deposit their pockets in these pockets, collect vegetables and take away the required people from there.
Those who give satisfaction also dont feel humiliated.
This is an example of what kind of work is being done with the help of society.
Today is the last day of April.
The States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are being established on 1st May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States have consistently tried to scale new heights of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and the lives of the great men of both the states continue to inspire us in every sphere of our society and in the memory of these great men, we should make a solemn pledge to take our state, our society, our city, our family on the foundation day of 2022, 75 years of independence.
We should plan to take that resolution and move ahead with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The summer of May-June in our country is like a spectacle of experience in March-April.
And when I was taking people's information on Mann Ki Baat, most of the people have informed me about what to do during these summer days.
s.
Many such friends have expressed concern about birds.
They have said that they should keep water on the verandahs, on the verandahs and I have seen that small kids from the family do this thing.
Once they came to know that they had to fill the water with ten times a day so that they could see if there is water in the utensils that have been kept and they keep looking at whether the birds had come.
We feel that this is their sporting activity but indeed there is a wonderful experience of awakening this feeling in the minds of small children.
You can also see a little flock of animals and birds feeling a new joy.
Just a few days ago, Shri Jagat Bhai had sent a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows and he had expressed concern about the decreasing number of chimneys.
However, in our country, animals and birds, nature has coloured them with co-living, but it is essential that these efforts should be collectively strengthened.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Syedna Saheb, had completed 100 years.
He lived for 103 years.
And on his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a massive campaign to save the images of Burhani.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He had distributed about 52 thousand bird feeders to every corner of the world.
He has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy, we are suppliers of milk, vegetables, postman, somebody comes to our house but we forget that there are days of summer, why should we ask them if they want water
Young friends, I also want to make some mistakes with you.
I sometimes take care that many of our younger generations are happy to spend their comfortable lives.
Mothers also keep meeting them in a protective condition .
There are others on the other side, but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the examinations are over and plans have been made to enjoy holidays.
It feels better even if it is hot and hot.
However, I would like to say something about how to make your vacation a friend.
I am sure some people will experiment and tell me.
If you use these vacations, I offer three of them then it is a very good thing but try to do something out of three.
New space, new experience, new skills.
Sometimes seeing something on television or reading in books or listening to the familiars and experiencing that thing by oneself , there is a difference between land and air in both .
Experiments should be positive and should be able to lead beyond comfort.
We are from middle class families, we are from happy families.
Sometimes you may feel that I don't say this again, do it once again.
Take the time of the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or take the literature of any sports activity and go to a poor village.
Play with those poor children yourself, you will see that you will often get the pleasure of sports before.
Whenever the children living in such a society get the opportunity to play with you, you have ever imagined how big a change will be brought about in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will repeat it again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several NGOs are working serving.
Sometimes very hot camps are there .
Personality is of development, it is of development and it can be participated in it.
However, at the same time, you feel that you have done such a bright exercise, you have done a course of personality development without any change, you reach out to those people of the society who have not got the opportunity and teach those whom you have learnt.
You can teach them how to do it.
I am also worried that technology has come to reduce the gap and technology has come to an end.
Every demographic technologies have been set up on the other side.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing and the idea of doing something is a good thing.
But also see that the human element within us is not confused, we are not far away from human qualities.
Whether it can be filled with skill development or with a little filling.
Try to spend time with oneself, away from technology.
Be it Tamil or Telugu or Assamese or Bengali or Malayalam or Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi in a new language.
If we look at the diversity of our country then we can find somebody or the other who teaches around us.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, don't get good pictures, but try to put something on paper.
The sensitivity within you will have to be revealed.
Sometimes we say small things that we dont want to learn.
You see, all these new experiments, these skills will give you joy and will bring you out of what you have built in a hub of life.
Please do something outside Chakori.
This is an opportunity to lead a life.
And you may be wondering if all the examinations are over, if you study on the new lines of work then that opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you have the verse of learning magic then learn the magic of the letters.
Keep showing magic to our friends.
You must try to know something that you don't know.
Your inner human power will be conscious and it will be a great opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that you cannot imagine how much we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new campuses.
He stayed for three days, four days after going to a place.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days or four days.
This will help you to learn a lot.
When you go, please send me a photo.
Have you seen what new
Where do we go
You can share your experiences using the hashtag incredible India.
Friends, The Government of India has also given you immense opportunity in this regard.
The new generation is getting rid of barriers.
You too do it but you can also earn from this scheme.
The Government of India has a scheme.
If you download the BHIM App, you will also be using it.
10 will be deposited by the government in your accounts.
If you have done it by 20 people in a day, you can earn 200 rupees by evening.
Businesses can also earn and students can earn.
And the scheme is scheduled till October 14.
You will be contributing to making Digital India.
He became a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience was saying that Lal Divas used to fall on the vehicle, it used to fall on the vehicle, but gradually he used to succumb to the head and this VIP culture has deepened in his head.
Now only the red lamp has gone, so no one can claim that the red lamp in the head must have come out.
I have received an interesting telephone.
He has expressed courage in this telephone, but this time the telephone shows that the common man does not like it.
He feels a kind of indifference in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I say Shiva Choubey, Jabalpur is from Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear that the everry India is a VIP on a road written in the newspaper. And I was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic congestion and I don't have to stop for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this decision.
Going to red divine by government decisions is a part of the system.
However, we have to remove it from our minds.
If we all make a concerted effort then we will be able to get rid of it.
Our concept of New India is to increase the importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country. And when I say EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is evident - Averi Person is Important.
Every individual has a significance, every individual has a importance.
If we accept the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians, if we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians then how powerful it will be to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we should recall our history, our culture, our traditions.
It gives us energy, inspiration.
This year we are celebrating a thousandth anniversary of 1. 25 billion Deshbandhav Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
Because of some reason we were so tired that we were thinking about it for centuries.
For other countries around the world, centuries have a great significance.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years old memories in its destiny.
Just imagine it.
Even today, there is a lot of difficulty in saying social conventional solutions.
How can it be done a thousand years ago
They themselves had done their behaviour to the society whom they considered untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he had organised a movement to enter his temple and had successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every age, great men have emerged from our societies to destroy the evils of our society.
While celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya ji, we have the strength to listen to the society, we should draw inspiration from them to awaken this spirit.
The Government of India will also publish a postage stamp to commemorate Saint Shri Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute Saint Shri Ramanujacharya Ji and pay my respects.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 1st May has one more importance.
It is also celebrated as Workers Day in many parts of the world.
And when it comes to Labour Day, Labour Discussions, Labour Discussions were held then it is natural for me to recall Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions that have been given to the workers today.
The contribution made by Baba Saheb for the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Saint Ramnujacharya Ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer Jagat Guru Basweshwar Ji of Karnataka in the 12th century.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
It was a programme to dedicate his pledge to the nation.
In Kannada, he had said - "What Kailas" means that you can achieve the Kailash of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work.
In other words, hard work is Shiva.
I used to talk about Shrameet Jayate again and again.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to recall Dattu Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems faced by the world today, violence, war, destruction, arms race, whenever the world sees such an environment, Buddhas thoughts are very relevant.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated by the United Nations on the auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will get a brighter opportunity.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and related facilities of this satellite will be very helpful in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
This is a remarkable example of our commitment to South Asia.
In most parts of the country, a large number of families will be in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have taken place, there will be some stress-free environment and those whose examinations are still going on, there will be some tension in those houses.
However, I would like to say this thing that in the past I had once again heard what I had told the students from Mann Ki Baat.
We will certainly be able to use those things during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26 March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Wang Brothers.
Today, on this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should progress and develop and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
We are a good friend and we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in this entire region by putting our shoulders together.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore has a shared heritage in his memory.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British had given him the title "Nighthood".
When in 1919 the British had killed civilians in large quantities in Jallianwala Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore was one of those great men who raised their voice against this incident .
This was the period when this incident had a peculiar effect on the mind of a child of 12 years of age.
During the adolescence, the young man who laughs in the fields, who laughs at the plantations, had given a new inspiration to the brutal genocide of Jallianwala Bagh.
In 1919, he was 12 years old, that is, our ladies and gentlemen, inspired by Shahid Bhattasingh.
Three days ago on 23rd March, Bhat Singh ji, his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we are aware of the incident on 23rd March.
At that time, the service of Mother India was satisfied and there was no fear of death on the faces of Bhagtsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
He had sacrificed all his dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still inspiring for us.
The ballads of the martyrdom of Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be adorned with words.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit that place, I felt that there are special pomps in that land and I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to visit Punjab then you must visit the tomb of Bhagsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and Bhagsingh.
This was the time when the pace of freedom, its intensity, its expansion continued to grow.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for a strong revolution.
So just a hundred years ago, on April 10, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian Freedom Struggle, a manifestation of Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian style was seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of the freedom struggle, especially from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
This was the time, the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the elimination of the mill workers in Ahmedabad and the deepest impact of Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and work style.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji in our hearts.
Imagine a person returns to India in 1915 and only two years of work.
It was just the beginning that the country was not aware of them, they were not influenced.
You can imagine how much hard work they had to face at that time.
Champaran Satyagraha was an event in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's strength to identify the nerves of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's struggle against the British Rajwati, organising, motivating and fighting the poorest of the poor, uneducated and therefore we experience the valour of Mahatma Gandhi.
We can learn this from them. And that was the time when Gandhiji, Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani, all of us were sent to the village.
And the British couldn't know what was the way Gandhiji's work, there was a struggle and there was a new construction too.
One side was conflict and the other was creation.
On the one hand, we have to lay down ourselves on the other hand in constructive work.
This is the desire to transform the 125 crore Indians. This is the reason that the foundation of a New India will be laid.
New India is not a government programme or a declaration of any political party.
New India is an appeal to 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who often go to hospitals, they serve patients, there are many people who run for blood only when they need it.
Many people are worried about their stomach.
Our country is multi-dimensional.
The service of the people is divided into our nerves.
If we look at it collectively, if we look at it in an organised manner then it is a great power.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will follow the rules of transport, if every citizen decides that he will fulfill his responsibilities honestly, if every citizen decides that he will not use petrol-diesel for a day in a week, he can see that things are small.
You will see that the dream of a New India and 1. 25 billion Indians will be fulfilled before your eyes.
I mean to say that every citizen should follow his religion, follow his duty.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude.
In the last few days, an environment has been created in our country that people have participated in the Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
After demonetization, various types of digital payments have been seen to increase.
BHIM App has been started for just two-two months but so far about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians will make a solemn pledge to dedicate 2. 5 billion digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget.
125 crore countrymen dont have to wait for one year if they take up this task on their minds.
This work can be done in six months.
2500 crore digital transactions, if we are going to pay a fee in our school then we will pay a digital payment in the journey of our railways.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several digitization fairs have been organized for public education and public awareness.
It is a pledge to have 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been organized.
There was also a Bakshis scheme in it.
About 1. 5 lakh people have been benefitted under the Bhagwan Consumer Scheme.
Seventy thousand traders have secured their deposits.
A big event will be held at the end of 100 days.
There is a large settlement system in it.
I believe that we will propagate BHIM App in the number of days that are still in our hands for Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
We will also participate in reducing the cash consumption and reducing the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to say that every time I ask for information from people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several different types of information but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness every time.
Honble Prime Minister, my greetings, I congratulate you all for the first time that you have won these elections with great fanfare.
I would like to share with you my thoughts.
I want to say that people themselves should understand the need for cleanliness.
Everyday I go through that river where most people pollute the river by putting garbage in large quantities.
This river flows from the other side of the Rispna bridge and reaches my house.
I would like to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a new paper.
Look, brothers and sisters, how difficult is the girl who learns in abundance.
How much anger is there on seeing the carpet in the river .
I consider this a good sign.
This is what I want that 125 crore Indians have a lot of filth in their minds.
Since the Swachhta movement has started, there has been awareness among the people.
Everyone has been connected with it positively.
Now this campaign has become a movement.
There is an increase in vaccination about cleanliness.
It has a different significance to create awareness and increase active participation.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than movement.
This is a movement to change the habits of the movement and it is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be collectively.
The work is difficult but we have to do it.
I believe that the spirit that has emerged among the new generation, children, students and youth of the country will automatically indicate good results.
Today, I would like to tell my fellow countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be the message of all of us.
Have you ever thought about how many nasaris we do in the food we put in these raw foods
Have you ever thought that it is not a waste of food, it is not a waste of food but it can fill the belly of the poor
This is not a subject that has to be explained.
When our mothers and sisters feed their children, they say that the more they want, the more they want them.
There are some attempts but the disgust in this regard is a social treachery.
This is an injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if savings are done then the family will get economic benefits.
I don't want to say much about this, but I believe that awareness should increase.
I am aware of some youngsters who run such campaigns.
He has prepared a mobile app.
Wherever such food is eaten or eaten, they speak to other people and utilize that food.
The youth of our country are doing such a great job.
We will find such people in every state of India.
Their lives also inspire us not to waste food, increase food as much as you want.
See, there are ways to change, those who are aware of health are often saying that the stomach should remain a little empty.
I will tell my countrymen, depression is not an incurable disease.
A psychological environment has to be created and then treatment starts .
Its first mantra is to reflect on despair rather than suppress it.
Tell your friends, friends, parents, feelings and teachers openly, what were you doing
Sometimes the problem of integrity is more in the students living in hostels .
They don't come to the food table.
Have you ever noticed why he does that
This is the first step towards depression.
If he avoids staying with his family, if he goes to a single corpse then it will not happen.
Those with whom he speaks openly, he will remain in the company of such people.
Make him laugh, motivate him to become a man, open the knot in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can become the cause of mental and physical diseases .
The way diabetes invites all diseases , like fighting , adventure , decision-making capabilities , destruction of this ability .
Your friends, your family, your atmosphere can keep you away from distress and if you are disappointed then you can get out of that mood too.
There is one more solution.
If we cannot be open to the people of our neighbourhood, do one thing, go to a place where the work is being done with the help of service.
If we try to understand their grief with service, we will have a new confidence in our minds.
By combining with others, serving someone and serving in a selfless manner, the stress on the mind becomes easier.
As such yoga is also a good way of keeping mind healthy .
Yoga helps in getting rid of stress, getting rid of stress and enjoying happiness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
You should also prepare from now and celebrate the collective yoga festival in the number of lakhs.
If you want to make some suggestions about Yoga Day, then you should guide me through my mobile application.
You can compose songs, poems about Yoga so that this topic can reach out to the people easily.
However, in the last few days, the Government of India has taken a major decision.
It is a matter of gratitude that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He takes care of the responsibility of the family, the financial responsibility of the household, which sometimes leads to injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken a major decision in this regard.
The women employed will now be given 26 weeks of maternity leave at the time of delivery and 12 weeks before the pregnancy.
Two or three countries are ahead of us in this regard.
India has taken a major decision for our sisters.
Its root cause should be the care of a newborn who is the future citizen of India.
If he gets the love of his mother, then this child will be the pride of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence the benefit of this important decision will be to nearly 18 lakh women.
May the lives of all these great men inspire us to make a solemn pledge for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Samvatsar, best wishes to you for the New Year.
It is time for the farmers to start cooking after the season of monsoon and the fruits of their hard work.
The New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country in different ways.
Gudipadwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Samvatsar Pooja in Awadh province, Jud-Shital in Mithila province of Bihar, Satwani in the province of Magadha.
India is a country with countless diversity.
I convey my best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Many thanks.
Windows are now over.
Monsoon has entered the life of all of us .
The fascinating splendor of the fruit of summer season is visible in the season of monsoon .
At the same time, peacock flowers in the fields renew the minds of the farmers.
Pulses of ribs indicate that holi has come.
Amir Khusro has described the moments of change that takes place in nature.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Fool Rahi Sarson becomes gross, Ambawa Foot, Tesu Phule, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
"When nature is happy and the environment is happy, humans also enjoy this season.
The festivals of Masan Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi fills the colour of happiness in human life.
We will sail in the last month of Falgun in an atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity and we will be decorated for the reception of the coming Chaitra month.
The monsoon season is the confluence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for a vote from you people, I get a lot of information.
Thank you very much for recalling this glorious achievement of India.
Be it poverty alleviation or prevention of diseases or be it attachment to the world or be it knowledge or be it attachment to the world, technology and science have underlined our importance.
15 February 2017 is a glorious day for Indias lives.
Our scientists have raised Indias head in front of the world and we all are aware that in the last few years, ISRO has successfully completed several missions.
ISRO has established a global record in the space sector in the last few days after its successful deployment of aircraft under Mars Mission on Mars.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for the entire country.
ISRO's Coast Efficient Efficient Space Programme is a wonder for the world and the world has openly acknowledged the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is Cartosat 2D. It is India's satellite and Mola is going to be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure, development information and urban development planning.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water resources are there in the country and how can we use them
It is also a matter of happiness for us that our young scientists and our women scientists have led this campaign .
It is a matter of great pride for the success of ISRO that such a large participation of youngsters and women is a matter of pride.
On behalf of the people of our country, I congratulate the ISRO scientists.
These scientists have retained the aim of using space science for the service of the nation to the common man and are recording new records.
Whatever we congratulate our scientists and their team, it will be less.
India's scientists have shown this thing.
The capability of this missile is that even if there is a missile to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometres, our missile will destroy it in space.
When we see a new technology, a new scientific exploration starts, we are happy.
Those who don't get the same answer, they don't stay healthy.
And if we observe the journey of thousands of years of human evolution then we can say that this journey of development is not complete.
New science, new technologies are generated and every technologies, every new form of science, every new era is born.
My dear young ladies, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said from Mann Ki Baat that our young generation should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientists can be a cause of sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
A few days ago, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organized a very different competition on the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful discoveries were invited.
Sometimes the problem underscores the importance of science to find answers.
Mumbai received heavy rainfall in 2005, floods in Mahapura, floods in the sea and several hurdles.
Whenever there is any natural calamity, the most critical is that of the poor.
Both of them worked tirelessly and developed a system of housing that will save the household, save the people living in the house, save the water from coming home and save the diseases that occur due to polluted water.
Mechanisms are also being technologically developed.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there has been an increase in the emphasis on DG-funds.
Especially the younger generation has a habit of making digital payments through their mobile phones.
I believe that this is a good sign.
In our country, in the last few days, the Bhagwan Consumer Scheme and Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana have received good support.
It took about two months, 15 thousand people are getting one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a mass movement has been welcomed all over the country.
It is heartening to note that today 10 lakh people have been rescued under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have been given remuneration and more than Rs.
More than 100 subscribers are those who have received Rs. 1 lakh per annum.
There are four thousand traders who have received 50-55 thousand rupees.
From Mysore, Shri Santosh expressed his happiness and wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a prize of Rs. 1,000 under the fortunate consumer scheme.
But I believe that he has written a very important thing to you.
He wrote that when he got a thousand rupees, he realized that a poor woman's house had a fire and all the goods were burnt in that fire.
Santosh ji, our boat and our work are giving us happiness.
You have done a very inspiring job.
Twenty-twenty-two-year-old Karkar Bhai Sabir, who is now associated with digital transactions, got a lakh rupees in the government's lucky consumer scheme.
Pooja graduates and postgraduate courses are being conducted by a young student from Maharashtra, who are also experiencing the use of RuPay cards and e-wallet in their families and enjoying their happiness.
One lakh rupees are important for him, but he has taken up this work as a watchdog and is also connecting others with it.
This movement has a very big role in the fight against justice, corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, in my view, is the anti-corruption cadre of the country and the anti-corruption path.
In a way, you are the soldiers of Shutcha.
On 14th April, a huge settlement of Rs.
There are approximately forty-five days.
Remembering them, we should teach at least 125 people to download BHIM App.
Teach us how to transcend and transcend.
Particularly teach those small and medium traders around us.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and BHIM App, give it special importance.
And that is why I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
BHIM App has to be added to every household, to 125 crore hands.
The movement that has started for the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in many urban settlements, several villages and several cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has played a very big role in the root cause of the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic momentum of the country.
Today, I would like to tell you a very happy thing.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the stores with hard work.
This year's record production is due to the hardships of the farmers of our country.
All the records are telling us that our farmers have made the records of the past.
This year there has been such a crop in the fields that everyday it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is more than eight times more than the previous record of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented success in itself.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the fact that along with traditional crops, the poor of the country should take the production of pulses because the poorest of the poor get the most prosperous from pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and laid several pulses on the ground for nearly two hundred ninety five lakh hectares.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
My request is that my farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for the way my farmers have worked hard and produced record pulses.
My dear countrymen, in this country, the government has taken some initiatives in the field of cleanliness from the society, from the institutions and from the organizations.
In a way everyone is aware of cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government is also making constant efforts.
A few days ago, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments led by our Secretaries was organised in Telangana under the leadership of our Government of Indias drinking water and sanitation department.
What is the importance of sensitivity in the closed rooms of the state of Telangana
Using this thing toilet pitting exercises were organized in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February .
The toilets of six houses were cleaned by evacuating them and the authorities themselves showed that the toilets used by the Twin Pit toilets can be used again by evacuating them.
They also demonstrated how convenient toilets are being constructed using these new technology and there is no difficulty in cleaning the toilets while evacuating them.
The more we clean up the toilets, the more we clean up the toilets.
And it is the cleanliness of the toilet potholes. If we look at the fertilizer as a fertilizer, then in a way, it is black gold.
We can see how waste to wealth is produced and this has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for the family of six people, this model will be filled in about five years.
After that, it can be easily removed from the waste and moved to the other side.
In the six to twelve months, waste waste waste was dissolved.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium are full of nutritive substances and it is considered a very good fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken initiatives.
Now a special programme has been started on Doordarshan.
The more such things will be broadcast in it, the more it will benefit.
Different departments of the government regularly organize Swachhta Pandharwada.
In the second phase of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are aware that when any citizen of our country does something good, then the entire country feels a new energy, it increases self-confidence.
We welcomed the performance of our disabled sportspersons at the Rio Para Olympics.
The country is proud of the success of these Divyang friends.
I often believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, they are determined, they are brave and conscious.
Every moment, we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
She has moved ahead with her step by step and brightening her name with her success. Just a few days ago, our women's team won a silver medal in the Asian Rabby Sevens Trophy competition.
I convey my best wishes to all these sportspersons.
Womens Day is celebrated in the world on 8th March.
In India too, there should be greater awareness and sensitivity in the family and the society to give importance to the daughters.
Moulgi Bachao-Mulgi Shikshawa is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today it is not just a government programme.
It has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
This initiative has been linked to the common man in the last two years.
This initiative has played a crucial role in every corner of the country.
The old rituals of the rainy season have changed the mindset of the people.
It is a matter of great joy when we get a news that a festival was celebrated after the birth of a daughter.
In a way, positive thoughts about daughters are becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kuddalor district has brought a special ban on child marriage under a special drive.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been linked with the scheme 'Mulgi Bachao-Mulgi Shikshawa' and efforts are being made by the district administration to ensure that orphan girls get their education along with organizing Gram Sabhas.
In the 'Har Ghar Dak' programme in Madhya Pradesh, education campaign for every household girl is going on in the villages.
Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign is being run in Rajasthan to motivate the girls who have left schools to re-school and educate them.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed according to local needs.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: "Women, Woman, Power, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman.
We were also actively participating.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
This celebration reminds the Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and their commitment to democracy, that is, a celebration that enriches democracy on generations to come, that is, an awareness of the responsibility of fulfilling democracy.
However, the more widespread discussions about the rights and responsibilities of the citizens in our country, the more widespread discussions should not take place.
I hope that at every level, the more important the rights are given, the more important the work should be done.
I salute the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
On the 30th of January, at 11 o'clock, we know that this two-minute silence should become a society and a country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of the brave soldiers who were honored with various gallantry awards.
The awards include various categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Special Service Medal etc.
I especially appeal to the youth of the country, you are extremely active on social media.
Can you do one thing Can you find out the details of the heroes who have received this honour at this time and write two good words about them and reach out to their friends
When we talk about the courage, valour and valour of these heroes in depth, then we are surprised, proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the news of 26 January when we were enthusiastic, while on the other hand, soldiers in Kashmir had to lose their lives due to snowfall.
I pay my homage to all those brave soldiers and bow down to them.
My young friends, you are aware of the fact that I constantly tell you my Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March and April is a period of great hardship in each family.
Almost every household has one or two children's examinations, but all the families used to go under the supervision of that examination.
Then I felt that this time is appropriate to interact with my student friends, their parents and teachers because for many years, wherever I visit those people, there is a great reason for the exams of children.
A very strange mental condition is visible in every household that the family is worried, the students are careful and the teachers are desperate.
When I was told that many teachers, parents and students had sent me a message, they asked me questions and sent some information, they mentioned the problems and difficulties faced by us.
I would like to share with you the ideas that have come to my mind by reading them.
I received a telephone message from the universe.
Sir, let me tell you that in the days of exams, our households, neighbours, our societies have created a terrible atmosphere.
It does not mean that the minds of the students are enhanced, but we become depressed.
I have so much to ask you whether this environment cannot be pleasant
"It is true to ask questions in creation but it will be in your hearts.
There are very few people who see pleasures in the examination.
Most of them used to have a pressurvey.
It is true that you have to decide the pleasure.
The pleasure that will be faced in this examination will get the same triangular fruit and the time of regret will come upon the processure that will take shape.
Therefore, I believe that you should fight the exams as if something is a sign.
This is the strength of festivals.
The entire family should enthusiastically fulfil their role in taking this festival forward.
The picture will change when seen.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are only three or four months of examination.
These three-four months should be converted into festivals in accordance with your traditions, in accordance with your family environment.
And that is why I will tell you, Smile More, Score More.
In a stressful situation, all the doors are closed, nothing can go inside from outside and can not come out inside.
The thought process stops and these things get overwhelmed.
And you dont have knowledge, lack of information, lack of hard work, where is it
But if there is tension then your knowledge, your information is suppressed under it and stress is there only.
It is important to keep in mind A happy mind the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes we feel that we don't look at the examination from the right point of view.
It is our mentality that there should be a question of life and death.
Whatever study you have done during the year is just about that.
You will not have to bear the burden of your entire life.
It is not a test of all these things that how you have lived, how you are living, what kind of life you want to lead.
Besides the examination conducted by the businessmen in the classroom, you must have gone through a number of cases.
And let us be free from this kind of bitterness, let us all know that the former President of India, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge facing education in today's era is that of education.
Marks are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress on the mindset of the students.
I would like to know your thoughts about the current trend of education and its future.
Though he has answered the question in his own way, he wants me to convey my views on this subject.
There is a limited use of qualities and qualities.
If you believe in these things then Mark will be behind you, you will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to harness your knowledge in your lives, you will be able to harness your confidence and determination.
Would you like to see a marksheet when you go to a lawyer to fight your big deal
Its experience, knowledge and a successful journey in the field of lawyers can be seen there.
That is why Mark's stance sometimes stops us from moving in the right direction.
Richa ji has also raised the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a very big mental battle.
It is easy to understand the examples of sports.
Most of the successful sportspersons have a unique feature that they compete automatically.
Let us take the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
Twenty years have always been a journey of ourselves, of losing ourselves and going ahead.
It should be a wonderful one because he followed the path of self-competing rather than competing with others.
Even in every field of AYUSH, you asked yourself the same question as studying in every field of AYUSH.
Earlier it was too late to wake up in the morning, why should we get up soon
Isn't it possible to sleep because of exam pressure earlier
He further said, My mother was not very educated.
However, I had to settle down with me and get rid of maths.
I would just like to tell the parents that they should focus on three things, accept, teach and give time.
Parents will experience that the expectations of their teachers and their children are at the root of many problems.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask a single question about the cause of that person.
He started listening to Vinodi Chuccha.
In just four or five minutes, the atmosphere was stagnant.
They keep getting scared by talking about the diseases going to meet the patient .
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we are very well aware of the affection of our children.
Have we ever thought of providing a happy, smiling environment to the children during the examination
Do that, the environment will change.
I have got a bigger phone call.
He says, "Namaskar Prime Minister, I cannot call myself because my childhood works.
Once I had tried to copy my child.
And when I tried to copy it directly, I was caught in it, I had a lot of trouble with my close friends.
These short-cut roads become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this many times.
I will say the same again.
Even if you look at it, you will see the effect of copying.
The same creativity, if the time is spent on the examination then perhaps there is no need to copy.
I have got a phone call, she says, "My name is Monica, I am a 12th student, so I would like to ask you some questions related to the board exams.
My first question is about the increasing tension during these examinations, how can it be reduced
"If I talk about sports during the examination days, your teacher, your parents will be on me.
It would be a matter of dissatisfaction to say how the Prime Minister is going to tell the children to play in the examination period.
Because sports have noticed that the focus on studies is very low.
This thinking is fundamentally wrong.
The problem is the root of it.
Let us take a couple of moments out of our study and see the sky, let us look at the trees around us, let us stir up a little bit and then sit in our room.
Whether or not for five minutes give this rest time to yourself .
You will see that the work was even more progressive.
Whether everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me the same.
There is no need to sit in the room for that.
Go to the chair, take a five minute long breath and then study.
Some people understand that if you wake up late at night then it will be a lot of practice.
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as you need .
Your efficiency will increase as much as possible.
When I go for the telecast for the elections, sometimes my voice starts shouting.
In one such meeting, I had come to visit a folk singer.
They asked me, 'How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously .
If you do, you will be able to live with me in your house.
It is a very big medicine to keep mind , intelligence , body alert .
Young friends, you are engaged in the preparation of examinations and I am stuck in my minds.
Kunas Thawk, perhaps this speech of mine will help you overcome the stress on your mind.
But at the same time, I would also like to say that do not take any action against those things that I have said.
If you want to gather then do it or dont do it or else it will also become a burden.
Don't bear the burden of expectations on the children, I am also impossible to tell your parents.
Our determined mindsets should be overcome by believing in oneself.
My best wishes are with you.
Give the form of a festival to cross every trick.
There will be no examination.
You should move ahead with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, on 1st February, 2017, we are completing 40 years of Indian Takshak Force.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers of the Armed Forces and the personnel of the Armed Forces for their service to the nation.
The Indian Task Force, including 126 Self-made ships and 62 aircraft, is supposed to be the fourth largest Task Force in the world.
Our Armed Forces personnel are embarked upon to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime areas of the country, guiding by their ideals.
Last year, the Takshak forces had taken pride in making our countrys coast clean with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in it.
They are truly grateful for taking care of the hygiene of these shores along the coastal security.
Very few people would be aware that not only men are there in the troop of our country but women are also playing their responsibility in the same manner by putting their shoulders on their shoulders.
Our women officers of the Task Force are aeronautical, observers and are also taking care of the responsibility of the Howercraft.
On his 40th anniversary, I salute the Indian Coast Guard for safeguarding Indias coastline as it becomes a question of global coastal security.
Festival of Festival will be celebrated on 1st February.
It is considered the time of the prayer of the student.
Not only this, it is an inspirational period for the heroes.
The song Mera Rang de Basanti Chola shows the same inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, while broadcasting Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio also fills it with its innovations.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a huge opportunity to connect with you.
Many congratulations.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, many congratulations to all of you.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and doing things in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said, We don't want the poor to take advantage of us but we have to accept it.
St. Luke has written in Ganspel, it has not only served the poor but also appreciated the service done by the poor and in the true sense it is empowerment.
A story related to it is well known.
In that statement, it has been said that Yessu was standing near a temple treasure.
Many Shrimantas came and made a lot of donations.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and she kept two copper coins in it.
Now if we go to see what is the value of two copper tins .
The devotees standing there were surprised.
Yessoon said that the widow has donated the most, but this woman has donated everything to her.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in Varanasi, where Malviya ji's penance was on.
I laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution made by Atal ji.
Under his leadership, he also raised the country's pride in the field of nuclear energy.
Whether it is a party leader or a Member of Parliament or a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has created an ideal in every field.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray for his good health.
As an activist, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awakened before my eyes today.
When I tweeted this morning, I also shared an old picture of how Atal ji's affection as a small activist would be sure to see it in the picture.
Today, on the day of bathing, the citizens of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn from each other and understand it.
In order to promote this process, the Central Governments Promotion Scheme for Consumers and Small Businesses is being launched from today so that the process becomes a habit of e-payments.
The Bhagyavan Consumer Scheme is a scheme to promote consumers and the Digi Dhan Business Scheme is an initiative to promote traders.
The scheme will start from today and continue for the next 100 days.
Each day 15,000 people will get Rs. 1,000 each.
At the same time, it will be a day-long settlement for the customers who will receive lakhs of rupees and after three months, on 14th April, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a great code on the day where crores of rupees will be saved.
Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businesses should themselves participate in the scheme and also involve consumers to prevent their transactions.
Independent deposits will also be provided for such traders and these deposits will also be in thousands.
Businesses will continue to be self-employed and they will also get the opportunity to win Buxis.
The scheme has been formulated keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class citizens at the centre.
More than 3000 buyers will not get the benefit of these deposits.
The poorest of the poor can also use USSD to purchase goods through feature phones or simple phones, sell goods and also provide money and all of them can be beneficiaries of this scheme.
In rural areas, they can also purchase and sell through AEPS.
30 crore citizens can join this Bakshis scheme immediately.
It is very simple, the easier it is to send messages from Whatsapp.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see that awareness about how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments is increasing at a fast pace.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision to promote this.
Traders will certainly be able to guess how big this decision is.
The income tax has been levied to traders who will exchange digital transactions, who will facilitate online payments instead of cash in their cargo.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Shri Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes on their own but they have started their implementation.
Someone told me that the Assam government has decided to give 10 percent concession on payment of freight tax and trading permissible fees through digital.
The bank branches of rural banks, which will be able to handle at least two digital transactions from January to March, will receive a deposit of Rs. 50,000 by the government.
He also announced a saving of Rs. 5 lakh under the Good Panchayat for Digital Transactions to 100 Digital Transaction villages by 31st March, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced a subsidy of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who have fully digitally paid seeds and fertilizers under Digital Farmer Shiromani Yojana for the farmers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all those who have taken such initiatives.
Several organisations have successfully experimented in promoting digital transactions among the poor farmers in the villages.
Someone told me that in a short span of days, about 35,000 farmers have purchased 5 lakhs of fertilizers through digital channels and purchased all these fertilizers in just two weeks.
It is a matter of pride that this year's fertilizer sales have increased by 27 compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the coverage of the informal sector has increased in our lifestyle. And most of the time these people are given labour money, work money or wages, cash payments and the labourers continue to be exploited.
Wherever you want to get 100 rupees, you will get 80 rupees.
They are also empowering the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have also made great strides in the field of start-ups.
These are golden days of digital movement.
Our youngsters can empower this region with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, all of you must participate in the mission to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge the people to give their advice before Mann Ki Baat every month.
80-90 percent of the suggestions received on MyGov and Narendra Modi Power are in the context of corruption and the fight against black money.
When I saw all these things, I was able to divide them into three parts.
It has been written in detail about the problems faced by some people and the problems faced by them.
The people of other types have written that despite the work being done for the welfare of the country, the work is going on in such a holy manner.
Third kind of people have insisted that this fight continues to be fought in support of what happened.
It is also remarkable that corruption, black money should be completely eliminated and strict action should be taken if required.
I express my gratitude to all my fellow citizens who have helped me by sending such letters.
Shri Gurumani Kewal pointed out that this step taken to prevent transactions of timelines is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like military forces.
The words written on the notes are false, the rates of sweets have increased, the deduction of two thousand rupees will be cancelled, the deduction of 500 and 100 rupees will be cancelled.
However, the people of this country were stunned to hear all these rumors.
Moreover, many people landed in the fields, they used their skills and wisdom to bring the true face of those who spread the evils, proved that Afwa was wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
My greetings to the people for their strength.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 1. 25 billion Indians stand with us then nothing is impossible.
Jan Janardan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this great vision of corruption and black money.
I felt that there should be widespread discussions in the House regarding the fight against corruption and black money.
Had the work of the House been done, there would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading the message of all kinds of concessions to political parties.
The law is the same for all.
Be it individuals, organisations or political parties, everyone should follow the law and everyone has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in search of government errors.
There is a question of repeated changes in the rules.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, what power has been involved in this period of dishonesty and corruption
When I decided to fight these people, they started a new effort to defeat the government.
On the other hand, many citizens have also written letters to discuss non-transactions and other aspects.
The common man is giving more information than the information that comes from the government system.
Our success comes from the common citizens awareness.
The government has prepared an e-mail address to provide information on such types of information which can be sent to them.
I express my gratitude to all those who have written such letters and their letters have faith and blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stopping. And there is no question of getting rid of the work for which 125 crore people are blessed.
In our country, we know that there is a law relating to Benami Property which was enacted in 1988.
He was buried in basana.
We have brought it out and implemented the Effective Anonymous Assets Act.
In the coming days, this law will show its impact.
Our top priority has been to do whatever is to be done for the benefit of the country and for the welfare of the people.
Indias ranking in the World Banks Enterprises Report has improved.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and have jumped 19 places in 2016 in the World Banks Domestic Performance Index.
The evaluation of several reports is guiding India to move faster.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country were disappointed by the session of Parliament.
Everyone expressed his anger at the passing away of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also openly expressed dissatisfaction over it.
However, in such a situation, there are some good things and the mind gets satisfaction.
A good work has been done in the Gadarol of the Parliament but the country has not noticed it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that my government has been moving ahead with the mission for the Divyangjans in a legislative parliament.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this thing. I thank them for the crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to the Divyangjans too.
I have personally tried to speed up this campaign.
I wanted the persons with disabilities to get their rights and get their due respect.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have renewed our efforts and confidence by winning four medals at the Paralympics.
With his victory, he raised the values of the country and also surprised the people with his ability.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have an invaluable legacy and power like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after the passage of this Bill for the benefit of the persons with disabilities, they will get more employment opportunities.
Reservation limit has also been increased to 4 per cent in government jobs.
The Government has enacted a new legislation in accordance with the UN concept.
14 categories have been added.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have also been proud of the fields of sports.
The Indian Cricket Association (ICT) has won 4-0 of its continuation against the United Kingdom.
Some young sportspersons commended them.
If our young sportsperson Karun Nair tries, then K.
L.
Behal played 199 drives.
Virat Kohli, the architect of the Kasauti Sangh, led the team while doing good work.
Indian Cricket Association of Spinner Golandaj R.
Shri Ashwin was declared as "Cricketter of the Year" by ICC in 2016 and "Cricket of the Best Crickette" by ICC.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you.
Even in the field of hockey, Tabbal has received a good news after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey Association has won the World Cup.
After 15 years of Tabbal, the Junior Hockey Association has named the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is auspicious for the future of the Indian Hockey Association.
Our women sportspersons also performed well last month.
Indian Womens Hockey Federation won the Asian Games and recently the Indian Womens Federation won a bronze medal in the Asian Championships less than 18 years ago.
I heartily congratulate all the sportspersons of Cricket and Hockey Team.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 should be a year of joy and enthusiasm, let all our resolves be fulfilled and let us scale new heights of development.
This New Year should also give the poor the opportunity to lead a life of happiness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for this year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I had gone to India-China Simmer to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the high altitude of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP, the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Every time, but the experience of this Diwali was a bit different.
The unique way in which 1. 25 billion people of the country sacrificed their lives, sacrificed their lives to the security forces, the same reflection came on the faces of every soldier and the feelings were filled with fervour.
Some poetry, somebody took out pictures, somebody took out a cartoon, some people made a video.
I was surprised to know that every household was in the army's post and when I read these letters then I was surprised.
These letters are full of emotions.
At the same time, an information was received on MyGov whether the coffee table book could be created by collecting the selected things in it.
One of the soldiers of our armed forces wrote to me: Prime Minister, the holi of our soldiers, Diwali and every festival is on the border.
It seems as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, what kind of emotions you have expressed about our armed forces in this Diwali will be limited to just a few occasions.
I urge you that as a society, as a nation, we should adopt this habit, be it any festival or festival, we should keep in mind the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire nation stood with the army, the strength of our army grew by 1. 25 billion times.
A few days ago, the Sarpanchs of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
He was a member of the JK Panchayat Summit.
They had come from different parts of Kashmir valley, they were about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time.
He had come up with issues related to the development of his village.
They had some demands and when our dialogue started, the atmosphere of Kashmir, the law and order situation, the future of the children came out.
And I saw that all the people of our country faced the same pain and sorrow as they had.
He says that the future of the children is not a school.
I urged them to pay attention to the future of these children.
Just a few days ago, there was a board examination and about 95 percent of the students and students of Kashmir had tested the board.
I would not only congratulate him for his enthusiasm, but I heartily thank his parents, relatives, teachers and Sarpanches of all Gram Panchayats.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked for your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat then I can say that I have sent information on one subject.
All of them had said that we should talk about 500 and 1000 notes in detail.
I was also aware that we will have to face many new challenges in our daily lives.
There cannot be a way to get rid of the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by us.
This is the decision of the five hundred and thousand dedications and such a large country, such a treasure of treasure, a billionaire note and this decision.
The entire world is looking at Barkain, every economist makes a detailed analysis.
In the entire country, the central government, the state government, the departments of local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and friends have been working day and night with the spirit of dedication.
Despite numerous tensions, all of them are working very peacefully, considering this work as a sacrifice of service to the nation and as an attempt to transform it.
They start in the morning, when will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such events emerge from television, newspapers and discussions everyday.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stakeholders who have worked hard in this great vision.
The identification of strength was only when success was achieved after a slap.
I remember Changal when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees had taken the burden on their shoulders and the work they had done in 70 years.
Today, once again he has accepted that challenge and I believe that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective strength of all, will give a new strength to this nation.
But bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not have that bad habit.
However, some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, these unaccounted money, benami money, some of them will be brought back to the system after finding some roads.
They are finding unlawful ways to save our money.
Sadly, he has chosen a way to use the poor in this regard.
They are trying to save money by paying money in their accounts by misleading the poor by showing temptations and temptations.
I would like to tell such people today, whether it is our will to reform or not to amend the laws or not to follow the laws.
But do not play with the lives of the poor by making a warm welcome.
And the government doesnt want our countrymen to face difficulties.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, J. Hadara and Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have shut down 5000 notes.
I would like to bring many such examples from Mann Ki Baat to the public that people welcomed this tough step for the advancement of the nation even after having lost their loved ones.
Because we used to say that good days will come but no one can imagine that we will take such a big step.
The people of black money and corruption have got a lot of strength after seeing the notes of 500 and thousand rupees.
It will never be a good day for every Indian.
I am so happy that I feel so proud that what is the unique potential of the common man of my country.
People go there, eat there and after 2-4-6 days when they go back then they pay money.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is a sense of service, devotion and honesty.
During the elections, I had organized the 'Chai Pe Charcha' initiative and it was played all over the world.
But I don't know that we are married to 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave only tea to the people who were married to her.
Once I saw news on TV, when I came to Ushira at night, I saw that there is a small village named Dhekiajuli in Assam.
What did they do when they got a deduction of 2000 rupees
Nearby, four neighbouring women came together and went to the market and collectively purchased and made money using a note of Rs. 2000.
See how changes are taking place in the lives of the villages.
Some people immediately benefited from this mission.
I got information from small towns.
It was found from nearly 40-50 cities that due to the closure of these notes, the people who were left behind were not paying the money.
We are aware of the fact that poor people dont pay the money two days back.
Those big people who are not familiar with it, those who knew that no one would ever ask them, they wouldn't give money and they would be very tired of it.
50 of the GST rates are credited to each municipality.
However, due to the decision dated 8th, everyone was able to gather their old notes.
Last year, about three-seven thousand crore rupees were deposited in 47 urban areas.
You will be surprised to know that in this week, Rs. 13,000 crore has been deposited with them.
But I specially congratulate the farmers of my country today.
I have already figured out the sugarcane production in this season.
The farmers have found ways even after facing difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in increasing economic conditions.
We have taken an important decision in the previous budget, just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the village will be able to do their business for 24 hours.
Initiatives were taken to provide loans to them through Mudra Yojana.
However, due to this decision, it was natural for them to face problems.
I would like to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank accounts on your mobile phone and you should also keep POS machines for credit cards.
Let us learn how business can be done without a note.
You see, the big malls, the way they enhance their business through technology, a small trader can enhance their business through a common "User Friendly Technology".
There is no possibility of any deterioration and there is an opportunity to increase it.
I invite you that you can contribute a lot to the creation of a cashless society.
Technology roads are safe, trustworthy and fast.
I believe that I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers and the hardworking brothers and sisters that you are very exploited.
Friends, You are my true soldiers and my dear friends.
There is a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and to take the country to the economic heights.
The world is not as old as we have experienced.
We are aware of the fact that the previous generation did not know what was the case.
We know how online banking and online ticket booking are being done.
There is nothing special about it.
However, today the country wants to do the great work, the dream that you have, the Cashless Society, it is true that we will not succeed 100 but we have not started it.
If we start the Cashless Society, the goal is not far away.
Wallet means E-Pakit.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards.
However, the poor have started using RuPay cards after 8th star, which has grown by nearly 300.
Just as you get prepaid cards for mobile phones and you get prepaid cards for spending money in bank accounts.
It is so easy to do that just as we send Whatsapp.
The uneducated people are well aware of how to forward Whatsapp.
Not only this, technology is getting so easy that there is no need for smart phones for this work.
Whether it is a washerman or a vegetable seller or a milk seller or a current letter or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have put emphasis on making this system easier.
All banks are working on it.
You must have read in the current letter of the last two-four days, when you have lifted the burden of levy of such cards.
The technology that is required to spend online will be in your mobile phone.
Otherwise, you can ask at least 10 families to spend half an hour or two hours a day to tell them what technology is being used and how can we download our bank accounts
We have to lead this campaign to make the country free of corruption, to make the country free of black money, to free people from difficulties and problems.
I believe that if the common man learns this system then he will get rid of the work and if all the youth of India bow down to it then it will not take a long time.
Within a month, we can stand as a modern India in the world.
And you can do this thing through mobile phones and you can do it everyday by visiting 10 houses.
I invite you not to stop by just supporting you, to become a force of change and to bring about change.
Let us take this fight forward to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters of that country have changed the lives of the nation and revolution took place only from the youth.
Kenya set up a mobile system called M-PESA, using technology, named M-PESA.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My young friends, I again urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to do this work in a collective manner in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSS, individuals.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, is moving ahead with the spirit of Swachhata campaign.
It seems that cleanliness is inherent in their nerves and that is why they remember the work of cleanliness on the occasion of the birth anniversary of their father.
He writes a poem by Harivansh Rai ji, one of them is Ol, soil stem, mind-set life, my introduction to Harivansh Rai Harivansh Rai.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with my thoughts, feelings and letters through Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat programme is broadcast at 11 o'clock, but you will soon be able to hear the translation from regional languages.
In every corner of India, Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other in the country.
This festival is the second name of the life of the Indians. Anyone who sees it will feel that it is natural.
Since Vedas, the tradition of festivals in India has changed over time.
However, one thing has been noticed in all these journeys that this entire journey of the festivals that are being celebrated in India, its scope, its accomplishment, its impact on the masses to the entire world.
The main objective behind this is to expand individual and personality, to expand our limited ideas from society to universe, and to achieve all these through festivals.
Our ancestors have scientifically participated in the festivals that are being celebrated in India in the form of sports, climate, climate, climate in which climate should be eaten, what kind of crops should be eaten, what kind of crops should be eaten by the farmers, how the day of cooking will be added to the festivals, what kind of culture should be there in terms of health.
Today, the whole world is discussing the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of festivals in India is going to enhance love for nature, enhance the love for nature from children to adults.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate the festival of creating a sense of compassion for everyone.
We take a ride on Sunday, but the older generation of workers, the Koli Bandhav used to take a break on the new moon and the dawn.
This darkness is not the darkness that comes due to lack of light, but it is also the blindness of darkness.
On the occasion of Diwali, it is an attempt to lit the light of positivity by lighting the lamps on the occasion of Diwali and eliminating the darkness of the society, the evil darkness of the individuals.
Even though the households of the poor are pottery, they are clean and shiny during Diwali days.
In that context, Insolvency and Bankruptcy is a mission of cleanliness.
But not only at home but the entire area needs cleanliness, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village.
We should expand this tradition of cleanliness with that synthesis.
This festival of Diwali is no longer confined to India's borders.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments around the world, parliament and administrators there want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
Perhaps you would be aware that the US Post Office has issued a Postage Stamp on Diwali this year.
The Canadian Prime Minister has also shared his photos of lights on Diwali on Twitter.
The Prime Minister of Britain organized a grand event to bring together all the societies on Diwali in London and participated in it.
There is not a single city in Britain that does not celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm.
What is the photograph that the Singapore Prime Minister has put on instagram and has shared with the whole world with pride
The 16 women MPs of the Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament from the Indian side.
He told me that the Prime Minister of New ealand had come here recently, and that he would like to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
On this occasion, I would like to say that this festival of light of Deepawali is also a festival of inspiration to the global community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Deepavali along with new clothes and various tasty food items crackers are played with great interest .
Small kids and youngsters are fond of fluttering.
Sometimes children don't get enthusiastic, sometimes they don't get enthusiastic, sometimes they try to make a big noise together and sometimes they invite a big crisis.
Whether our neighbours are likely to have a fire or not
In the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, news of fire and death is a matter of concern.
In the days of Diwali, many doctors are busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is going on for a long time.
While celebrating Diwali, we also prepare for Chhathpuja.
In the eastern part of India, Chhathpuja is a very big festival. This festival, which is considered a festival, is celebrated for four days.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
Whatever Surya Devata gives us, it is difficult to realise what we get from direct and indirect Surya Devata.
Chhath Puja is a festival of the worship of Surya .
It is said that people worship the rising sun in the world.
But Chhathpuja is such a festival in which the surya is also worshipped.
And through that also a great social message is given.
My future is a feeling of gratitude for the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces and I have come to mind with the same feeling that this Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen for the mission of Message to Soldiers.
Today, I would like to bow down to the people of India that there is no feeling of love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The way this feeling has been expressed, it has given every citizen a different power.
Through the message of all of you, the soldiers of our security forces have got new patience and freshness.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons or actresses, all of them have expressed their feelings.
The media has recognized this festival as an opportunity to express gratitude towards the nation.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, at the same time somebody is standing in the desert, somebody is protecting the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the industries and somebody is watching the safety of the airport, all these soldiers are performing innumerable responsibilities.
I can imagine this moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
Sandesh to Soldiers has expressed innumerable sentiments in a comprehensive manner.
Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has sent a poem to me.
I am talking about Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers are getting a big boost with the mission of Sandesh to Soldiers that we have launched on this Diwali.
My friends and sisters were both officers in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are several officers in the Armi Circle on the borders of the country, who are receiving very good messages and they are getting a big boost.
I would like to inform you that along with the officers and soldiers of the army, their entire family and their wives also sacrifice a lot.
Through our messages, the entire army community is receiving very good messages and I would like to convey my best wishes to you all on Diwali.
Whether it is a natural calamity, a law and order situation, whether it is a problem in deterrence of law and order, whether it is handling the enemy or the daring to bring the youth back on the wrong path, our soldiers continue to be inspired by the nation in every sphere of their lives.
I would like to tell you about one incident and I would like to tell you what things can inspire you to achieve success.
We have an ITBP trooper in the security forces, development is inhabited by a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Bada.
Our ITBP jawans had gone to their villages in winter.
That is why Himachal Pradesh could truly become an open defecation free state.
Very few people go to that village.
The engineering students of the city, who were a little away from that village, had no toilets here.
NCC faculty, members of NSS and engineering students decided to construct toilets in this village.
All the materials, vitamins, cement and other essential items that were required to construct toilets were used by these youngsters on their shoulders and piped the entire day to that village.
They built toilets in that village with their own hard work and demonstrated a small village in the remotest part of the jungle with open defecation.
That is why Kerala will soon become an Open Defecation Free State.
Gujarat has declared that all municipal corporations and more than 150 locations are Open Defecation Free.
10 districts have been made Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee Festival on 1st November and it has decided to make our state Open Defecation Free within a few months.
So far, 7 districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I sincerely congratulate the people of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for contributing to eliminating the darkness of the country in the form of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme they have to stop the first scheme after presenting such a second scheme.
However, most of the time nobody notices this thing.
While the old schemes are going on, the new schemes are going on, the upcoming schemes are awaited and this is going on continuously.
In our country, those households where gas is used for cooking, those households that have electricity are not required for kerosene.
He has taken a major decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon become kerosene-free after seeing the way they have taken up this work.
Only arbitrators and parties will be hit by it.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of us.
The need of the hour is to take care of the ambitions that have been created in the minds of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step by one to get out of the crisis.
Whatever our old thinking is, the difference between son and daughter should be eliminated in society.
Reforms in schools are now free of cost for children and daughters.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters the experience of an India free of discrimination.
After the 21st century was destroyed, it was not right to be dark in the villages.
The campaign to provide electricity to such villages is being successfully implemented to make them free of darkness at the earliest.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to 5 crore such families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, small shopkeepers used to get stuck in the evil cycle of cooperative business.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account have been freed from this evil cycle of interest.
Direct money is deposited in the banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the real beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from intermediaries and parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, who dedicated his life to the unity of India, is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great personality of the country.
You would be aware that on 31st March, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is being celebrated.
Sardar Patel led his entire life to connect the country and successfully improved his mission, he brought everyone together.
At the same time, Durgadeva said that on that day Indira Gandhiji was assassinated.
We all know what happened in the country after their deaths.
Sir, I would like to ask you what can be done to prevent such an incident
My dear countrymen, this is not just the sadness of one person.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country.
The injustice done to Sardar ji on the birthday of that great man who lived for unity is painful for all of us.
However, we need to take care of all these difficulties and we need to move forward by chanting the mantra of unity.
The unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is in many languages, in many species, in many diets or in many diets, the unity in diversity is the strength of India, its specialty, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to save the country from the ideas that spread bitterness.
It is our responsibility to make Sardar Saheb a Shreshtha Bharat.
The basic principle of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb had started to see the struggle of the farmers.
However, Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for conflict but also for creative work.
I pay my homage to Sardar Saheb and urge you to remind him of the unity wherever you may be on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Poornima is a festival of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are a guide not only for the entire human race but also for the entire human race.
Service, truth and Sarbat da Bhala was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Shanti Unity and Sadbhavana were their basic mantras.
In every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev, a campaign was launched to free the society from discrimination, superstition and evil.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his co-worker when he had reached the extreme boundary of such distortions as sprish-untouchables, caste-culture and high-level.
Just like Guru Nanak Devji, let us move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, which inspires us to discriminate and work against discrimination.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you on this Diwali dedicated to the soldiers of the country.
My best wishes to all of you for fulfilling your dreams, for fulfilling your resolutions, for enjoying your lives in a comfortable and comfortable manner.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
We have defeated the eighteen brave soldiers of our country in the recent terrorist attacks in Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
He will wipe out every such thread and he will lay the foundation stone for the effort to make the 1. 25 billion people of the country live happily.
But the army does not speak.
Today, I would like to specially speak to the people of Kashmir.
Anti-national forces are now being recognized by the citizens of Kashmir.
And as the truth is being understood by them, they have started moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from these ideas.
Every parents feel that schools and colleges should be re-organized at the earliest.
Farm goods and fruits produced in the fields are likely to go to the markets across India.
It seems to be ease of doing business.
And for the past few days, this process has started smoothly.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem and find ways and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
Governance has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to know a lot about the attack through social media.
It provides an opportunity to understand, understand and understand the emotions of every kind of people in every part of India and it strengthens democracy.
The young man named Harsh Vardhan, who has learnt about the 115th year, has recently given me a different idea.
Then I made a solemn pledge that I would study for more than three hours a day.
It will be a citizen who will be useful to the country.
I am glad that you can calmly imagine this thing at such a young age when you are getting married in the atmosphere.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would like to say that the emergence of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
It is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This shows the determination to do something.
Everyone felt that something should happen, everyone felt that something should be done.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this spirit of the country in a very good manner.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan gave this mantra and inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
Every citizen has another way of expressing patriotism in the voices of Bombay and the guns, which was demonstrated by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Karthik has written on Narendra Modi Power that he created his history for the Paralympics competition, and the game he showed is the victory of human consciousness.
Mr. Varun Vishwanathan has written on Narendra Modi Power that he has done a very good job in his own country and we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only both of us, but every individual of the country has been associated with our sportspersons in the paralysis.
Going beyond sports, the performance of these Paralympics and our sportspersons has brought about a complete change in the perspective of humanity and the vision of Divyangjan.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik Hin said.
When she won the medal, she said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is a lot of strength in this bend.
At this time 19 athletes participated in the paralysis competition with the three women of our country .
In comparison to other sports, when differently abled play, physical capabilities, sports skills are even greater than that.
You will be happy to know that our sportspersons have won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Devendra Jhajriya, who won the Gold Medal, won the second gold medal in Bhalafek.
And when he was born, he had to lose his hand due to a power jerk.
Just imagine, what kind of meditation could have been done by the person who won the first gold medal in the twenty-first year of his age and won the second gold medal in the twenty-first year
Mariyappan Thangvelu won the gold medal in the high flying version.
He will not live in a big city or even in a middle class Shrimant.
In the twenty-first year of age, despite physical obstacles, he made the country a medal with determination.
Thalit Deepa Malik also made the flag hoisting of Vijay Dhawaj.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in a high flying manner.
Very few people would be aware of the valour that these disabled people have done in the Paralympics competition.
I was surprised when I came to know that the players who won the fourth medal in the Divyang sportspersons did not get the medal, but they completed the run in less time than the players who won the gold medal in the Sabal sports event.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a convenient scheme for Paralympics and its development in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, last week I had experienced a lot in Gujarat's Navsari.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibir for persons with disabilities and several world programmes were recorded at that time.
This world cannot see, Gauri Shardul and that Nang district had come from the remote jungles, the entire Ramayana is enlightened in its poetry.
And the people gathered there also heard that when people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book, the success stories of the lives of persons with disabilities were collected in it.
This experiment was registered in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of pride for all of our countrymen to have three world-class programmes from differently abled persons on the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on October 2, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become a habit and every citizen should have this responsibility and an atmosphere of bitterness should be created about cleanliness.
Now, when two years will be completed on 2nd October, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased among 1. 25 billion Indians.
And I had said - one step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everyone has certainly tried to move ahead with one pool.
And that is why everybody, be it the ordinary citizens, the government offices, roads, bus stations or railway stations, schools or colleges, religious places or hospitals, from children to senior citizens, rural poor, farmer women, every citizen is contributing something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
I want you to move forward.
And that is why if we want to talk about rural India then two crore twenty five lakh toilets have been constructed so far.
A healthy competition has been started in the states, districts and villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be successful in Open Defecation Free Village Campaign.
Congratulations to those who have worked for this thing and best wishes to those who have been working for this thing.
And I would urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the dignity of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children.
Let us move ahead with this resolution.
Especially my young friends, I would like to present a scheme for those who use the technology in a big way.
By calling this number in 1969, we will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in our cities, but will also be able to apply for construction of toilets.
You should take advantage of it, especially for the younger generation to take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to come forward.
They should sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
He will be sent to the district as a representative of Swachh Bharat Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been told to purchase the fertilizer that is produced from the waste.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to provide that fertilizer.
Those who want to improve the health of our soil, those who care about the health of the soil, those who have suffered from the use of chemical fertilizers should be provided with this fertilizer as per the requirement.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as a congratulatory ambassador.
I am inviting youngsters to start new start-ups in the field of waste to wealth and waste to wealth and develop technology for them.
This is certainly a thing to do.
Indonesian, India Sanitation Conference is being organized during 25th September to 3rd October this year.
The Ministers, the Chief Ministers, the Mayor of the Metropolitan Cities, the Commissioners will meet and discuss only cleanliness and cleanliness.
What could be the technology
What could be the economic policy
How can we get public participation
How can it create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new reports about cleanliness are continuously coming up.
Recently, I read in the newspapers that students from Gujarat Technological University went to seven villages and started awareness campaigns for toilet construction.
He himself suffered and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Param Vir Singh, a team of Ganga swimming from Devprayag to Gangasagar, 2800 kilometers away and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their guidelines.
Every department decides for fifteen days and focuses on cleanliness.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department will jointly formulate a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
In the last two weeks of the month of October, the Ministry of Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs will launch Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective areas during the period 16-31 October.
I appeal to the citizens that we should also participate in the departments with which we belong.
You must have seen that surveys related to cleanliness are done.
Earlier, surveys were conducted in 73 cities and it was presented to the people of the country about the condition of cleanliness there.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all of us will contribute to this thing.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is being celebrated.
I have been urging you to purchase Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
Even this time I would like to tell you that there should be only one thing for Khadi in your family so that the bankruptcy bill can be applied to the poor household.
On Sunday, 2nd October, can we become a citizen of ourselves participate in the cleanliness drive
Two hours, four hours, you take a direct part in the cleanliness drive and I will tell you to take a photo of it and share it on Narendra Modi Power.
If you have a video then share video.
Look, our efforts will give a new strength and a new impetus to this movement across the country.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of presenting it in life is different, no one should register it or not.
And the response that he received will be called a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
Several young, small and big institutions of our country, corporate people, students and NGOs will jointly celebrate the joy of giving wikes in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is a mission to bring together food items, clothes and reach out to the needy.
It was a pleasure to see the sportsman on the faces of those poor children.
I believe that we should encourage those youngsters in the cities where this joy of guiding is going to be celebrated.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyay in Pondicherry and today is the beginning of his birth centenary year.
Millions of workers like me, who have been working with political ideology, have been given an explanation to the political ideologies.
He spoke of Indias root-related diplomacy and gave support to Indias cultural traditions.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay is being celebrated today.
This is the principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke about the interests of every person in the slums.
How to reach the poorest of the poor
He presented the Sara Economic Framework in two words: Work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashami.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way we appreciated and blessed this programme during the completion of two years.
I also express my gratitude to All India Radio because they did not just broadcast the message of Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to communicate from all the regional languages to the listeners.
I am also grateful to those people who have written letters after Mann Ki Baat, who have laid down the doors of the government, who have shown the wrong things of the government, I thank them, All India Radio has given a platform to the government officials to solve the problems of the people.
And that is why Mann Ki Baat is not just a fifteen-twenty-minute conversation, it has become an opportunity for social change.
There can be something more enjoyable than this for anyone.
How will it be a festival that connects humanity
And that power will be the tool of true power and then we will celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let us inspire this power, let us take a mantra of unity.
Let us celebrate the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity and goodwill to take the nation to new heights. Let us celebrate the victory of Vijayadashmi.
English rendering of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, on 29th August, the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand, the architect of Hockey.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remember his contribution on this occasion.
In 1928, 1932, 1936, he played an important role in winning Indias hockey gold medal in the Olympic Games.
Your cricket lovers know the name of Bradman.
My dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, there is a lot of information on MyGov or Narendra Modi Power.
Besides cricket, Indians are also very fond of sports and awareness.
Giving this message to me, it became a source of inspiration.
Sachin says, Make sure to talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in this Mann Ki Baat.
Girls have won the medals we have received.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anybody.
One of these girls is from North India, one from South India, another from East India and another from India.
Therefore, it seems as if these daughters of the entire country have taken a vigorous step to brighten the name of India.
My Government has written that we have been able to do better in the Olympics.
He says, "Congratulations to Honble Modi sir for winning two medals in Rio first.
But I would like to take care of this thing that was really good for our achievements
And the answer is, no
We need to take long steps in the field of sports.
Our parents focus on the study today.
The society also believes that sports is a waste of time.
We cannot ignore the fact that we have not been able to perform as per our expectations.
It has happened in some cases that those sportspersons who performed well in India, who performed well in sports here, could not show them there and only two medals were received in the medal tally.
One more thing is that if you don't get medals then you will find that for the first time, Indian sportspersons have performed very well in many sports.
Look at this, our innovative Bindra ji stayed at the fourth position in Nembaji and made a medal with very little difference.
The same thing happened in Tennis, Senya Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar was eligible for the final round of the Track Field...
You will be happy to see that womens hockey team has reached the Olympics after 36 years.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the men's hockey team was able to reach the nock out ferry.
Our team is strong and it is a part of the pride that Argentina, who won gold medals, lost one match in the entire competition, who was the one who defeated them
The performance of some sportspersons was good, for example Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das...
My countrymen, we have to do a lot of things but if we continue to do anything and do something then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will conduct a thorough study and examine what is being done about sports worldwide.
The committee will formulate a framework on what we can do well.
We have to make plans with a vision 2020, 2024, 2028.
I also urge the state governments to set up such a committee, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in the field of sports
And I believe that we have 65 of the population of 1. 25 billion countrymen, we should collectively achieve the best in the world of sports.
We have to move forward with this resolve.
Deshbandhan, 5th September Teacher's Day
For a few years, on the occasion of Teachers Day, I spend my time with the students and I was spending my time as a student among them.
I was learning a lot from these students too.
For me, 5th September was the Teacher's Day and Education Day.
Therefore, there is a thought in the mind that we should express our feelings in this regard...
The place where Mother is in life is also the place of teachers.
I have seen such teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They lead their lives for their disciples, students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand is discussing.
They are not only sportspersons but also an example of how excellent teachers are.
Teachers always feel contributed in the lives of all of us.
On 5th September, the birth anniversary of the former President of India, Shri Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and the entire nation considers this day as a teacher day.
Even if he reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the field of a teacher himself.
I have written in such a beautiful handwriting and my own letter is very bad.
Whose signatures have shown that respect for me increases.
If you have a photo on Narendra Modi Power with your teachers, if you have a good memory, a motivational thing then you must share it.
Keep in mind that it will be valuable for you to see the contribution of teachers from the point of view of students.
Brothers and sisters, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disgraceful person and all of us feel that our country, our society, our family, every person, their lives should be indiscriminate.
When we think of Ganesh Festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of Ganesh Festival is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak.
Through this, we need to discuss issues related to social life, we need to create programmes that inspire the society to get new inspiration, new energy and self-esteem that they have given me is my birth right.
Today, Ganesh Festival is being organized not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions, sequence competitions are held.
It touches social topics through artistic drums.
This kind of public education campaign is going on through Ganesh Festival. Lokmanya Tilak gave us the inspirational mantra of 'Swaraj'.
Now Suraj is our right, let us move towards Suraj, can we not give the message of this mantra from the public Ganesh Festival
I am inviting you.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
Festival brings newness to the individual and the society.
Life is impossible without festivals, but it is expected to change as the need of the hour.
On this occasion, I have noticed that some people, especially Ganeshotsav, Durga Puja have written a lot about it and they are worried about the environment.
The idol made from POP is not environment friendly.
This pain has been inspired by others as he has done in Mandali.
I pray to all of you that like ancient times, use the idols of Lord Ganesha and Durga Mata and do not follow your old tradition.
In a way, it is God's service that protects the environment, protects our river ponds, protects the lives of those who are deprived of pollution.
I don't know what kind of emotions we will take these issues, but I don't tell them alone, but this is the opinion of many.
According to some, the sculptor of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfale, the founder of Kolhapur Nisarg Mitra, science scholar
Environment friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
Durgapuzha has a lot of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her whole life to the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa gets the title of Saint who served the poor of India throughout her life.
On 4th September, the delegation led by the Government of India and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then there is a big change.
Manpower is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, made a successful effort to bring people together for clean Ganga and Ganga.
On the 20th of this month village heads of Ganga coast were invited to Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all the Chief Ministers of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal for coming here for this pledge.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have realized this vision.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the cleanliness drive of Ganga by bringing together the peoples power.
Somebody wrote from English and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that there should be a toilet in our house.
They demanded toilets.
Some kids wrote that this year my birthday will not be celebrated but definitely make toilets.
The children of seven to seventy years have done this thing.
It was so impressive and emotional that on the second day, parents wrote letters to the teachers to go to school and assured them that we will build toilets in the house by one stretch.
Congratulations to all those students who have tried for this thing and specially congratulated the parents that they decided to make a toilet with their children's letters seriously.
A sixteen year old girl Mallama from this district called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the specialty of these village chief Mohammad Shafis
They collected eighteen thousand rupees and built toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has been the dream of every Indian.
This is the resolution of some Indians.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, every person has not been associated with it, every person contributes something or the other.
Everyday news is being reported - what are they trying to do
The Government of India has called upon the people to make a two-three-minute cleanliness film and send this short film to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the TV channels that we should also make such competitions.
The vision of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness drive.
I invite my fellow countrymen, I have always desired that India should always have a harmonious relationship with neighbouring countries.
However, this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are today connected with the same cultural tradition.
They will interact with each other and share ideas and the Bangladeshi people of both countries will enjoy the All India Radio.
All India Radio contributes immensely to people-to-people contacts.
The President inaugurated the Channel.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I also convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio that they are contributing to the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, we have assigned the smoke of the Prime Minister to me but in the end I am a human being like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me a lot.
Some of these emotional events also give new powers, inspire and inspire me to do something or the other for the Indian people.
He wrote to me a 84-year-old I-G Retired Teacher.
Even though I was told that I should not declare my name, I would like to mention his name.
In a letter, he said that he had requested to give up gas subsidy, he left the subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago someone of ours came and gave me a letter and thanked me for the Give it up.
For me, this letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than Padma Shri.
My dear countrymen, whoever left the subsidy on cooking gas, tried to give them a letter, someone or the other will give me a letter from my representative.
It is my endeavor to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke and I am a retired teacher and I will be a young man in a few years.
I am sending a donation of fifty thousand rupees so that the poor mothers can be saved from the smoke of pilferage.
We are aware of the fact that a mother who has been aborting from the pension of a common teacher, who gives 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers for gas connections, the question is not about 50 thousand rupees.
This is the blessing of crores of mothers and sisters that strengthens the faith in the future of my country.
He did not write this letter to me as the Prime Minister, but wrote a simple letter: Modi Bhai
There have been frequent flood situations in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local bodies, the social institutions have done as much as possible by the citizens.
In August 2016, all political parties, including opposition parties, did not give a single chance against each other, jointly approved the GST Bill.
Its credit goes to all political parties and if all parties start working together then what was the big thing
Similarly, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country collectively took up a single issue.
Those people who try to create this kind of compassion by moving ahead with these small kids, they will sometimes have to answer this thing to innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is big, the country is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a society by binding this diverse nation in the bonds of unity, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen unity and only then will the future of the country be brightened.
I have full faith in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi this morning and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will paint every youngster in the country with enthusiasm and hope.
You all are aware that in a few days, the world is going to have a big sporting magnificence.
The name Rio is going to be added to our ears again and again.
25 billion people of the country have the responsibility of fulfilling the self-confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to play in Rio.
We should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we may be in the next few days.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after working hard.
This is a kind of tough penance.
Winning and defeating are important, but at the same time reaching that sport is more important than that. And that is why we convey our best wishes and good wishes to all the sportspersons for the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem lover - Suraj Prakash Upadhaya, a student of Punjab Central University.
Many of you may be poets who have written poems, maybe they will write poems, some people will do that in every language, but the poem that Suraj has sent me is sharing with you.
This young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam ji.
The whole country and the world paid tributes to him. But when Abdul Kalamjis name comes, the words of science, technology, missiles come forward and the pictures of future-supported India come forward. And therefore, Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realise the dream of Abdul Kalamji
Your saying is right Ankita ji
And if we want to go with him or go ahead with him then we should do research and innovation and both these things are the souls of technology.
If research and innovation are not there then technology becomes a burden just as the stagnant water produces odour.
If we live without research and innovation on the strength of old technologies then the government has taken some steps to create the sweetness of science, technology research and innovation in the new generation so that it becomes time-bound in this changing age.
And if I say Let us aim to innovate then it means my AIM.
10 lakh will be given to those schools where such tinkering labs will be constructed and Rs. 10 lakh will be provided for their care for five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
We see problems and difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology based answers.
We have called upon the young generation of the country through Atal Grand Challenges to find solutions for them through technology, innovate and take them to us.
I am glad that when we came to know that the people are interested in it, we told about the Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, even Amma used to worry about the drought, these days we are enjoying the pleasure of the rains and the news of the floods is also being reported.
The State Government and the Central Government are working very hard on shoulders to help the victims.
Everyone feels happy, the human mind is happy because the center of our entire economic upsurge is rains and the agriculture is there.
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to repent for our whole life .
But if you are aware, alert and striving then the ways to be saved are simple.
But we are sometimes a little distraught in terms of action.
The government, the hospital, the doctors will certainly do their job but I urge you all to be aware of the fact that you dont have access to dengue in your homes, in your family or in your family.
Dear countrymen, I want to draw attention to another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast and due to continuous running, we dont get time to think about ourselves.
If a patient falls sick then he feels that he will recover quickly and for that nebiotics are taken negatively.
We should not walk on the shortcut route.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even if it is absorbed then it will benefit those bacteria, it will benefit more than necessary bacteria, hence the course of taking pills has been decided in the number of days.
It is important to fulfil it, but it is necessary to complete the course.
In medical terms, it is called nutritious resistance, it should be followed by the rules of using nutritive substances.
In the last decade, maternal mortality rate has declined, but even today, the lives of pregnant mothers cannot be saved in very large quantities.
Decrease in the amount of blood during pregnancy , infection during pregnancy , high blood pressure , nobody knows the complications that lead to their life .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign named Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign on 9th of every month a sure check-up of pregnant women will be done at the government health center .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I appealed to the gynecologists that you cannot provide free service to the poor mothers on the 9th of this year.
Whether my doctor brothers and sisters cant provide 12 days of a year for the poor
There are thousands of such doctors who have written the same letters as they took forward the work by accepting my request.
There are thousands of such doctors whom I believe.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
In the Sukracharya Policy, Nasti Valia Anushadhan, there is no plant that has no medicinal properties.
Those who donate trees are protected by trees in the world as well.
But even today there are some people who follow these ideals and bring them into practice.
The discipline of Mahabharata has said that trees also fulfill the responsibility of the child in the world, as if Sonal had taken the initiative to fulfil the wishes of not only his parents but the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, inspired his grandson Sonal in a different way.
The temples should start the tradition of planting plants in the rainy season.
Plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I constantly tell the farmers that because of damaging on the edges of our farms we damage the land. Can we do the farming of timber instead of dam
Today, in order to build houses in India, to make wooden goods, lakhs of rupees have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees in our fields and nearby areas which are useful for the goods and the work of the house, after fifteen-twenty years we can sell them by the permission of the government, we can get new means of income for our farmers and we can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, a lot of campaigns were carried out in several states using climate change. The Government of India has recently ratified a CAMPA Act and more than Rs.
I was told that the Maharashtra government had planted 125 crore trees in the entire state on 1st July and pledged to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi celebrated a big forest festival and pledged to plant twenty five lakh trees.
Twenty five lakh trees in Rajasthan are not a small thing.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they can see how big they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the green cover of 50 by 2029.
Railways have also started this work in the Green India Mission launched by the central government.
There is a bright tradition of the Suddha Forest Festival in Gujarat .
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Shahid Forest in Gujarat have been taken up under the Van Mahotsav and have been running a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but all are eligible for admiration.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
When there is a foreign tour, there are discussions about international policy trade, security related issues, some agreements are being signed.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage.
South Africa said that it is natural to recall Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness fall on the ears of the world, then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela diamonds come upon us.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited the Finnic's Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be in my memory.
Equality and equal opportunities are not such a mantra for any society and government.
Equality and fraternity take us to a bright future.
We all hope for a better life, we want a better future for the children, the needs of everybody are different, the fronts are different, but the roads are the same and that is development, equality, equality of opportunity, equality and respect.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have demonstrated this value of life in South Africa.
Prime Minister, I am speaking artificial verma from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman had lost her e-mail and committed suicide.
I am deeply saddened by this as a woman.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everyone knows this thing that when we know about our mobile phones and e-mails then there are fascinating messages that you have been saving so much money, you pay so much money and take so much money.
If some people fall in love, some get stuck with greed.
These technologies are spreading the form of affordability around the world.
Sometimes we fall in love.
I believe that we should be cautious about this zeal and be cautious. If there is such a false news then we should tell our friends and friends that they should make some awareness.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet several people during the Parliament session.
Our MP brings people from his department, he brings them, he tells them about himself, he tells them about his problems.
But I had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Watching the enthusiasm of children and daughters, they had brought a big album with themselves.
Artificial paintings are drawn and painted at the station.
You must go to Aligarh and see this station for sure.
This is an example of a change that can be brought about by peoples participation.
Thanks to all those who have worked like this in the country, special felicitations to my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with rainy season, festivals also take place in our country.
Festivals are celebrated in temples and pilgrimages.
You are also being associated with these festivals at home and outside the house.
Raksha Bandhan is a special occasion of our link.
Whether we cannot provide the Mothers and sisters of our country with the help of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan like last year
Just imagine, please visit the sister so that she can be safeguarded.
Moreover, if you have a woman who makes a meal in your house, if you have a woman who cleanses your house, if you have a daughter of a poor mother then you will be able to offer them 'Suraksha Bima Yojana' or 'Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' on the occasion of Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of you who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
75 years of independence and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new enthusiasm, hope, this can be an opportunity for the country's resolve to do something.
This festival of freedom should not be a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
It should be a festival like Diwali.
I hope that you too will do something good that connects with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort on 15th August.
And whatever you have in your mind, whatever you want, that thing should be described from the Red Fort in detail.
As a representative of yours, as a prime minister, you must write to me from the Red Fort and give me a new idea.
Let us commemorate the brave hearts who laid down their lives for freedom, let us recall the great men who laid down their lives for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Once again I got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
For me, Mann Ki Baat is not a ritual.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that I can reach every nook and corner of India through Mann Ki Baat.
I thank All India Radio for the successful efforts made by All India Radio to translate Mann Ki Baat into regional language at 8:00 pm.
And I am glad that those people who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programme bring their emotions to me through telephone and through MyGov website and through Narendra Modi App.
I am very useful to run the government on the suggested issues.
How active should governance be for the welfare of the people
How much priority should be given to the welfare of the people
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
5th June is World Environment Day.
Environmental issues are discussed and carefully discussed all over the world.
The main theme of Environment Day is that the United Nations will not only discuss the ero Tolerance for Elligel Wildlife Trade (EWTTE) but we should also talk about the trees and talk about water.
You must have seen that the Himalayan foothills of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir had recently been hungry in the jungles.
Therefore saving the forests and saving the water becomes the duty of all of us.
Nearly two-and-a-half hours of discussions were held with the Chief Ministers of every state.
He heard what he wanted to say.
Some states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have used technology in a big way.
We need to reach out to other states of the country through the NITI Aayog.
Public participation becomes the main reason for success in tackling such problems.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important.
Therefore, Drop More Crop - Each drop - More production, Micro Irrigation - Micro Irrigation, Micro Irrigation, PK on less water.
It is a matter of happiness that in many states sugarcane farmers are now using micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation and some are using Tushar irrigation.
I also came to know from them that there are big targets before many states, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, which have done a lot of work in terms of irrigation.
Their efforts are to bring 2-3 lakh hectares of land under micro irrigation every year.
If this campaign is implemented in all the states, it will not only benefit the agriculture but also increase the water conservation.
Our bonded mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to harness the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers in a better way.
Efforts are being made to replenish groundwater with the help of technologies through the Niru Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
In the peoples movement in Maharashtra, people are also providing financial assistance along with Shramdaan.
I am sure that this mission will really help Maharashtra to save its future water conservation.
The State of Chhattisgarh has undertaken a state-of-the-art state-of-the-art campaign.
A massive campaign has been launched to revive the visitors of the ancient times in Rajasthan and Gujarat as a Jal Mandir.
However, in some parts of that state there is water shortage.
There is a big work being done by tying chakhams and small bundles.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water therefore we kept walking quietly and on the end of monsoon there is no water therefore how would we get scared 
And water is not limited to farmers alone.
This is related to all the villages, poor, labourers, farmers, urban, rural and Sreemant-Garib.
Therefore, water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali, how much water we have saved during this rainy season
You will see that your joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just the work of the government, it is not of the political leader but of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India is going to be transparent.
Which are going to be delivered from one end to the other end of India.
We will have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I would like to touch upon such a topic that if we helped me then we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a cashless society.
We can earn money and send money through electronic technology.
There is no fear of going to your pocket stove, it is not anxious to keep your pockets fit.
Then it will be automatically registered.
Using this method will be a bit difficult in the beginning but once the habits are over, this system will become easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, the Aadhaar number was also received and mobile phones are now in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-Jam (JMJDA).
We can move forward in the direction of cashless society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan Dhan accounts.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And a small instrument has also been made available to PSLV.
O.
It is called the Point of Cell that through this machine you can pay others by using Aadhaar number, RuPay card.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to provide funds through POS.
We have taken the second initiative, that is the bank on mobile.
It will be easier to transfer money through your mobile phone.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
Vehicles are also underway to provide banking services in the post office.
If we learn to use this method in practice, if we make a habit of it then there is no need for direct movement, it is not necessary to take the amount in the pocket.
Transactions will continue automatically and will lead to transparency.
Behavioral transactions, two number transactions will be closed.
The impact of timelines will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge my countrymen to start this thing.
You see, once this system has been started, we should move forward in a comfortable manner.
Twenty years ago, had anyone ever thought about it
Gradually it became a habit now it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that the cashless society can be shaped gradually.
However, it will be better if it comes in a short span of time.
We should encourage our sportspersons who participated in the Rio Olympics and increase their self-confidence.
The Chief Minister was the candidate.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Do they get nutritious food according to requirement or not 
Whether the trainees should be trained for their physical well-being or not
I am glad to see that be it the result of elections or be it the possibility of renewing my responsibilities as Chief Minister, I am so keen to be a sports minister in such a cooperative environment.
When our sportspersons feel that the countrymen are standing with us, this is a big strength and their confidence is blessed.
Last time, I had referred to the topic of FIFA Under Saventin World Cup.
I have received information about it from all over the country and during this period I can see that the atmosphere of football has started to grow all over the country.
Many people are taking initiatives and forming your own team.
I have received several suggestions on Narendra Modi Power.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing, but I had a pleasant experience of sporting in the hearts of thousands of youngsters of the country.
We are familiar with the relationship between Cricket and India but I have seen that there is so much faith in football.
Everything should not be counted as victory and defeat.
With the spirit of sportsperson, India should make its identity in the world.
I urge my countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for our sportspersons.
New results are coming from somewhere or the other for the last eight-ten days.
I am not talking about election results. I would like to talk about those students who have studied and examined for a year.
It is now clear that our daughter is singing the valour of our daughters.
It is a matter of happiness.
We have to move forward with confidence.
However, a new kind of question has come up for me and I have never thought about it.
I felt very fond of reading this.
He says that when I went home after getting 89.33 marks, I felt that I would be appreciating it all around, but as soon as I got it, I was told that if I got 4 times more then it would have been 90.
But I feel stiffness in my mind.
I am proud to have read your letter Barkai. I believe that this pain can not be yours alone but millions and millions of students like you.
It is because the atmosphere has become so comfortable that we can find errors rather than enjoy it.
This is the second form of negativeness.
I would like to appeal to the neighbours and the parents to welcome and appreciate the results that your children bring.
Otherwise, it will be a day when you will get 100 marks and no one will say that it is true that you have achieved 100 marks but it would have been better if you have done amulet.
Therefore, it is important to have a limitation on everything.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written a similar letter.
He says that people near him are not ready to accept his fate.
They say that something could have been better, something could have been better.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation do not let yourself be balanced.
Everybody expects and listens.
Stay firm on your resolve and try to do something better.
However, if we do not accept the satisfaction of what we have received, we will never be able to create new things.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the songs of success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good qualities in the perimeter go ahead in sports, in the field of music, in the region of Kalakusari, they go ahead in business.
God has given everyone some skills.
Just recognise your inner strength, focus on it, you will progress in life.
There was a time when the saints used to be an integral part of the folklore of Kashmir.
But Pandit Shivakumar, who touched the play and today became an important player in the field of global music.
In the Chinese and Indian music fields, the musical instrument was limited.
During the times of King Maharaja there was a place of Saint at the entrance of Darbar .
But Ustad Bisimilla Khan took the word and placed the sage at the height of one of the best musicians in the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I realize that the expenses incurred on the medicines in the poor families of our country will be supplemented by the financial inclusion of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very low, but after falling sick the health is like before but it costs a lot.
Why don't we keep our lifestyles so that we don't get sick, we don't have financial burden on our families.
One is cleanliness is the most important way of escaping from the disease.
If someone can serve the poorest of the poor then it is cleanliness.
And the second thing is that for which I constantly appeal is Yoga.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
All over the world there is an attraction, faith and the world has adopted it.
This is an invaluable gift that our ancestors have given us to the world.
The world with stress is capable of leading a balanced life.
It is easy for the people associated with Yoga to be healthy, balanced, balanced and concentrated in every work.
21st June Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective atmosphere can change the lives of an individual.
I hope we will do something about it on 21st June.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use this day on 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can Yoga be practiced in our social life
I urge you not to stay behind.
It is extremely important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly connected with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Several days ago, I had given you a mobile number and I could listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever you want to listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call to this number, you can hear it in that language.
Hello.
We decide to do a lot of things during the holidays.
And during these vacations it is considered as a season that if you want to enjoy the pleasure of ambia then it will be better if you do a little wait in the afternoon.
However, this time the joy has been enjoyed by the severe heat.
It is natural to have a careful environment throughout the country.
And whenever there is constant drought in it, water streams burst.
Sometimes, due to encroachment, sometimes due to obstructions, there is less water conservation in the reservoir than the capacity.
And this happens year after year, the water storage capacity decreases.
However, I have seen that the citizens are also making a lot of effort for this thing.
In many villages, there is awareness about this and the true value of water is known only to those who have faced the menace of acute drought.
And there is sensitivity about water conservation and there is also the ability to do something about it.
Just a few days ago, I was told that the Hivare Bazar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have handled the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
They decided not to waste crops such as potatoes, potatoes and bananas.
It sounds very easy to hear but it doesn't seem easy.
Have you made a solemn resolve together
He took the initiative for irrigation of Tushar, Dhibak irrigation, water conservation and recharge of water and hence, today this village has remained self-reliant to eliminate water scarcity.
It is true that I am telling you about this small village of Hiverbazar but I congratulate all the villagers and their best work.
He built about twenty-seven farms.
As a result, ground water level rose, water level rose.
When crops need water, they get water and high data, he added.
The income from farming increased by twenty percent.
Besides water conservation, water quality improves due to increase in water level.
However, many such initiatives are being implemented by the citizens who never come forward.
Sometimes the government has taken a good mission and sometimes it gets fame but if you look around you, you will see how people try to find ways to overcome this problem through innovative solutions to end the drought.
It is a human nature that whenever there is a great deal of crisis, the feeling of elimination of all evils is emerging.
It is very likely that there will be 106 to 10 percent rainfall in this rainy season.
There is still time for rains but this news of good rainfall has brought a lot of consciousness.
Can we take up a campaign to save water in the villages
Farmers need soil and it is useful for the crops in the fields.
And if we take the village bottom and put it in the field then it will benefit the farmers and it will also increase the capacity to collect water in the bottom.
Our neighbours will get water.
Today there is a problem of water, there is a situation of drought, but the next month-and-a-half months are in our hands.
Their anxiety is social because this work has been going on for the last thirty years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been formulated so that a lot of money has been spent.
Ganga gives us a blessing, it gives us employment, it gives us a new strength to live through the Ganges.
As the Ganga flows, it gives a new impetus to the economic development of the country.
A bhagirath brought us to the Ganges but it requires crores of Bhagiraths today to save it.
This mission will never succeed without peoples participation.
Several initiatives are being taken at the government level.
Efforts are being made to obtain cooperation from the states of Ganga Kati.
Efforts are being made to involve social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the Ganges water.
Solid waste is supplied from the rivers to the rivers in large quantities.
In order to clean this waste, the work of cleaning water waste waste at Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of a trash skimmer.
It has been made available to all local administration agencies and has been requested to use them to clean the waste.
And I was told recently that where these efforts are being done well, three to one to one tonne of waste is removed every day.
That is, it is true that the dirt that is being produced on such a large scale has been prevented from increasing.
In the coming days, plans have been made to set up trash skimmers at some places and people living on the banks of river Ganga and Yamuna will soon be able to experience it.
In order to prevent industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with paper-lagada industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar mills.
Today, I believe that this will have a good effect.
The forgetfulness of the waste materials falling from the paper mills is now on the way of closure .
This is the symptom that we are taking steps in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person visits me in the southern part of the river then he will definitely say that the Ganga will be clean.
This confidence of the common people will succeed in the cleanliness drive of Ganga.
Citizens are donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This work is going on in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as the Panchayati Raj Day in India.
This was the beginning of the Panchayati Raj system in our country.
And gradually the Panchayati Raj system spread all over the country is working successfully today as an important component of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mhow, the birthplace of Dr. Ambedkar on 14th April.
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in the state of Jharkhand where our tribal brothers and sisters live in large numbers.
And at 3 in the afternoon, he interacted with all Panchayats across the country.
This campaign has done a great job in creating awareness.
How can a democratic institution be strengthened at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
Foodgrain initiatives have been taken in some villages.
The awareness that has come from the villages is that of India-Uday.
Gram Uday is the foundation of India-UDA.
Therefore, if we focus on Gram Uday then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Gharpure called Sharmi from Mumbai and expressed his concern.
I am speaking Gharpure to Sharma from Mumbai.
I have a question about school and college education.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector over the last several years.
Not getting proper schools or colleges available or the quality of education .
Even after completing their education, they don't know many basic things, so that our daughters in the world remain behind.
What are our ideas about this
Today, every family has the biggest dream of mothers and sisters that is education for children.
The parents should be concerned about how to teach, educate and educate children. And I believe that the results of this awareness among the families are visible in the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized on the issue of education and every government has made efforts for it in its own way.
However, it is more important to improve our education system than to the extent of expansion.
You have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
We should now have priority for quality education through literacy campaigns.
As a result, we need to focus on the roadmap that has been calculated today.
Preferences have been observed on how many children came to school today.
Now we will have to focus on providing good education and proper education to the children who have come to school.
You must have seen the budget of this government and you have tried to emphasize on providing good education.
In this budget, we have been told to free 10 government universities and 10 private universities from government control and come to a challenging, competitive level.
Would you like to work for the best universities
This scheme has been launched with the aim of giving them complete freedom.
At the same time, education has as much importance.
For the past few days, people have been asking me about one issue.
He wrote on the web portal MyGov, some people wrote on my Narendra Modi Power, and a large number of youngsters are writing about it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am talking to Mona Karnawal from Bijnor.
In addition to education, sports is also important for the youth of today's times.
They must have a common sense, they must have good leadership, which will lead to their overall development.
I would like to encourage more and more youngsters and the government also encouraged NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to my mind that before speaking to you, talk to all these boards.
And when I asked them that earlier this kind of meeting was held, they replied that this is the first such meeting since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all the youngsters and young friends who have expressed their gratitude to me for all these things.
There is a lot of work at your level but if our organisations work in a collective manner, then what a big impact can be achieved.
Now it is true that I myself was the cadet of the National Cadet Corps.
I got the benefit of this thing from my childhood and I also believe that there should be a new consciousness in such organizations.
I put forward some issues in this meeting.
Many things have been talked to him.
There are several young organisations in our country, what innovations can be brought about in their systems and programmes
If you write on my Narendra Modi Power then I will go to the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a boost.
I believe that it will be possible for you to associate yourself with all these things.
My dear countrymen, I have to tell you one thing that you will run away to think.
I believe that this is a matter of awakening to all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that what kind of gas cylinders will be given during the last several elections
And every political party used to feel that if the middle class had to go on the polls then gas cylinders were a very important subject.
This is a public experience.
However, it has never been considered outside this chatti.
Today, my countrymen, I am delighted to seek my honour before you.
I chose a different path and that was the way to trust the masses.
Sometimes we should have more faith in our people than believing in ourselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
Grant in our country was denied when it was the right equation.
I would especially appeal to all the political parties today to say that we should do at least one thing to trust the people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought.
We have to move in this direction.
And I always feel that as if I had come to mind, why should I take a call for third and fourth class jobs
Believe in those who have been tested and qualified.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there is no ticket test on this single line of railways.
It comes to my mind that there cannot be any government rules but the atmosphere of trust can be created.
And none of the political leaders who have created this environment have created it by millions of families of the country.
Every breaking news on every newspaper and news channel is painful.
Isn't there anything good in this country with a population of 100-125 crore
Please change the situation.
Raviji has expressed his deep anguish, but I believe that this anger is not on me but on the situation of being fond of me.
You must remember that your former President Dr.
I have seen that some television channels make a positive news time.
Today, the atmosphere of positive news is being created.
Everyone feels that a good news should be given to the people.
It is true that the greatest person, the best thing, the best words, the best words, the best way to be spoken in a better way, the greater the consequences, the better the positive news gets, the better the results.
It is true that if we put more emphasis on goodness then we will not have enough space for evil.
If Deep Petwa is to be removed then it will be possible to remove darkness.
And that is why we might think that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens.
And this is such a portal on which you can send a good news about yourself.
Can be contributed by Devu
Ravi ji, you have asked for good information, but please don't listen to me.
The Kumbh Mela is the speciality of our country.
Kumbh fair can be a center of attraction for tourism .
There were very few people around the world who knew that for a long time crores of people came to the river bank.
Silence is celebrated in peaceful , calm and peaceful environment .
In order to organise such events, people are setting new benchmarks in order to manage the programme.
For the last two days I have seen that many people are uploading photos of the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India should compete with the tourism departments of the state government and urge people to upload the best photographs.
Not only should there be cleanliness, but those who return from there will take this message of cleanliness.
I believe that Kumbh Mela is a religious, spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social festival.
I am glad that as usual, things in our minds have connected my thoughts with an unbreakable relationship.
Mann Ki Baat always awaits me and you too.
This time I have seen a lot of letters, reactions, phone calls, information, inspiration, inspiring people to do something or the other.
However, I would like to share your thoughts with you once again in the spirit of Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that the last time I had discussed some things about Premchand ji's book and we had decided to share some of the books that I read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But I must admit one thing that I cannot give time to save a book on a very large scale.
However, one advantage is that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of many books from whatever you write and write.
However, I believe that we should take this initiative forward on the experience of the last one month.
You can make a coin of books on the Narendra Modi App and when you read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can also suggest a good name for the copies of these books.
And I feel that the Indians have lost their hearts on the subject of water.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
The media has launched several innovative missions on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked hard to give a definite direction to a waterfall that flows from the mountains.
And that is the pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil smoke and cooking but also helped the farmers to get water.
You will be happy to know that Meghalaya is the first state in the country to formulate a water policy in the North-East.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crops that are facing water shortage are being encouraged and the farmers do not suffer any losses.
Many fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Can we not use these fairs for water conservation
Every layer of the society goes to the fairs.
In these fairs, we can deliver the message of water conservation very effectively, we can fill up exhibitions, we can dramatically, with festivals, we can deliver the message of water conservation very simple ways.
In fact, World Children Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a sporting event in which the youngsters who have been saved from cancer are those who have emerged from cancer in their lives.
Football and Table Tennis were organised at the event.
All these 10 winners of our country won the medal.
Some players have won more than one medal in this.
Sanjiva Haripura of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga of Kolkata, P.
Several people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, this year, the vision of Space Progress has been very vibrant for India.
Our scientists had left ASAT in March, followed by Chandrayaan-2.
However, there was not much discussion on the big and important events like ASAT in the elections.
With the help of ASAT missile, we achieved the capability to launch satellites at a distance of 300 kilometers in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve unprecedented success and now, on 22nd July, the entire nation will be proud to have taken steps from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikota.
Photographs of Chandrayaan 2 filled the nation with dignity and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the Moon.
With this, we can get more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what two big things I can learn from Chandrayaan 2 then I will tell you, these two things are Feath and Fearlessness, which means trust and fearlessness.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities, believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both the heart and the spirit.
The entire Swadeshi system is a mission.
When there was talk of innovation and innovative zeal in new areas, our scientists are best, they are world class, this campaign has proved once again.
The second important thing is that there is no need to be afraid of any crisis.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists have solved all the technological questions in a record time, by day and night, in the Chandrayaan-2 space.
The world has witnessed this great penance of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and the time to reach Chandrayaan has not changed due to difficulties.
Often we have to face temporary setbacks in our lives but we have the capability to eliminate them.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 mission will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September, when lander-wire and rover-wire will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the young friends of the country, young friends and young friends about an extremely charming competition and I invite the youth and youth of the country - a quiz competition
I appeal to young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make our participation more entertaining and unforgettable.
I specially urge the school, the parents, the enthusiastic headmasters and the teachers to make a lot of effort to conquer their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the government of India will take the maximum number of students from every state to Sriharikota. And in September, when they land on the surface of the moon, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students, for that you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to achieve the highest number of qualities and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done a observation.
Our Mann Ki Baat has been expediting the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of many.
We have achieved an ideal situation in terms of cleanliness, but the way we have achieved in terms of cleanliness from the open defecation free villages to the public places is the strength of the resolve of the 1.
This campaign is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had seen the story of Yogesh Sainik and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sainik is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to India to serve Mother India.
He had taken the vision not only to make Delhi clean but also beautiful some time ago.
In his team he started from the trash of Lodhi Garden .
Through street arts, beautiful paintings have been arranged in many parts of Delhi.
When he started showing his art from the walls of overbridge and school to the slums, people also got support and in a way this silsila started.
You might remember that during the Kumbh Mela, how Prayagraj was decorated with a painting on the road.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team played a very important role in this too.
No good sound of colours and fibres can be heard, but the indradhanush that is produced by them is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience it in the beauty of the cleanliness campaign.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
We have to move forward in the direction of making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting response to MyGov.
This was the reaction of Bhai Mahmad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, It is good to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing the Bank to Village of Community Mobilization Programme in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
The programme should also be monitored online.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which people directly interacted with the government.
Bhai Mahmood Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it my eagerness to know about the Bank to Village Programme increased. And when I got a detailed account of this, the entire country should be aware of it.
This programme imagines how the people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development and how enthusiastic they are.
Discussions were held on subjects such as literacy, sex quality, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, ground education, senior citizens queries.
Friends, This programme was not just the government's formality but the officers returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officers took a two-day stay in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, children were sportspersons.
Sports literature, job cards of MNREGA and certificates of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also shared.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the 'Bank to Village' programme was organised in such far-flung areas to reach where government officials had to pave the way for a day and a half by climbing the mountains.
These officers also went to the border Panchayats where there is constant fear of firing from across the border, and officers were frightened in the highly sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so enthusiastic that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is extremely pleasant to see a large number of people participating in the Gram Sabhas in these regions and prepare plans for them.
It is also obvious that people are looking at creating hatred in the path of development, they can never succeed in their domestic aims.
My dear countrymen, the renowned Shriman Dattatray Ramchandra Bendre, the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he has said, "Hodige Madige Agyed Margya, the earth is burning. That is, the bonds of rain and the streams of water are burning and the earth is enchanted to see their beauty.
In the whole of India, Alang culture and speaking people celebrate Shravan month with their own methods.
In this situation, when we look around, it seems as if the earth has made a shawl of greenery.
Everywhere a new energy is transmitted.
In this holy month many devotees visit Kavad and Amarnath Yatra, while some people fast regularly and wait for the festivals like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
During this period, Rakhi Purnima, a symbol of the love of sister-in-law, is also celebrated.
You will be happy to know that the most emotional participants have participated in the Amarnath Yatra for the last four years.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
The more emotional participants participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, the more emotional people have participated in it in just 28 days.
I particularly appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey are filled with the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have also been told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months since the start of Chardham Yatra this year in Uttarakhand.
For the first time, so many such number of pilgrims have reached there after the devastating disaster in 2013.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those parts where you used to see the natural beauty during monsoons.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage is not a big teacher.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and auspicious month of Shravan, and for the new energy, new hope and new hope.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of the uit India Movement.
I would like you to make some special preparations for the 15th August, and find a new way to celebrate this festival of Independence.
When we look at the television then we see only one aspect of the monsoon - floods, saturated waters, traffic congestion, our farmers who are happy with the other pictures of Mansoon, our birds hunting down, our flowing streams, the green shawls we have to come out with our family.
Rain, freshness and joy both bring freshness and happiness with you.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stop, there seems to be a difficult task but there is a limit of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you must be busy in exams.
Today you often look forward to the conflict between India and Australia.
India has fought against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come for a new revolution in the world of sports.
And you see that India is creating an environment of craft like football, hockey, tennis and junk.
Perhaps you would have come to know that India is hosting the FIFA World Football Competition in 17 years next year.
24 global associations are expected to play in India.
And on the other hand, I see that the attraction of football is increasing among the youth, be it EPL, Spanish League or Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to know about these conflicts and see them face-to-face television.
How will there be a competition between governance, educational institutions and social organizations to connect themselves with sports
We see that all this has happened in the case of cricket.
But this is the environment that we have to prepare for other sports.
This is a golden jubilee for India to be recognized.
My dear students, you must have decided on tourism during these holidays.
And I noticed that the work that we have not gathered in our tourism department, our cultural department has not been possible, the state governments have not been able to do it and the government of India has not been able to do it.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there is not a single district in India where I have not gone.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am happy that nearly 10,000 people have visited the coal mines of Sawaner near Nagpur as tourists.
Tourists and tourists can also see some attempts being made from both sides of the tourist spot .
All attempts may not be of a scientific method but are being done.
Will we also pay special attention to this
I am sure my young friends will help me in this work.
Employment generation is possible through tourism sector.
India is far behind in terms of tourism as compared to the world .
But if we decide to emphasize the tourism sector of 1. 25 billion Indians then we can attract the world towards India.
The biggest heritage of tourism worldwide can attract our country and create employment opportunities for millions of youth of our country .
Be it governance, institution, society or citizens, all of us have to do this together.
Let us strive towards this thing.
My young friends, the bets have come and I don't think that they have gone like this.
If you don't come to swim then you must learn to swim in these beds.
If you don't have a cycle, you can't run a cycle in these beds.
Even today, while typing computers on computer, I do with two fingers, do not I learn to do clean typing
There are many skills for our personality development.
You will see that after the school has started, after the college is started, you will go back to that place and tell your friend that Dasta, I have learnt this thing during this week, if I don't learn anything then he will tell you.
My time was over, but you have learnt a new one.
Friends, there will be mutual discussions on this.
Several suggestions have been received on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.
In the winter season we had told that the spectators also have the problem of sunlight , for this keep them on their balcony or chairs in a vessel filling water in a vessel .
I did the same thing and I was glad to tell you that it was my friendship with Chimanya.
He called me and reminded me of a handicraft work .
I remembered the last time and I had said that in the summer season, keep water filled in the earthen pots for the birds.
The actress told me that she did this throughout the year and she had been friends with many people.
Mahavir Verma, the great poet in the field of Hindi literature, had a great love for the birds.
He had written in his poems, "Do not let you go away, you will fill your courtyard with donors and fill your heart with hum salt and sweets.
Let us also do this thing that Mahadevi had said.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into account a very important issue.
Have we ever given water to them during summer days 
Craft, I thank you very much, you have given a very simple way to a sensitive subject.
However, in India it is a habit.
But I express my gratitude to you for seeing this thing of craft.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, You must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people believe that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to know that a farmer's facility has been prepared for your service.
If we download the Kisan App in our mobile phones, we can easily communicate a lot about agriculture and climate.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this facility on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, For others the season of sunrise is the time of sunset but for the farmers it is the time to sweat.
It waits for the rain.
The time before the start of direct farming season is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think about what will happen to us by water.
The ponds, water-driven drains, water-driven roads in the ponds, where some waste is stored or some encroachment has taken place, water logging stops and consequently water logging down slowly.
In the first rainy season, if the water was saved, if the ponds were filled, if the rivers were filled then if there was no rain then there would be less damage to us.
You must have seen that we have decided to construct 5 lakh farms.
Emphasis has been laid on water conservation through MNREGA.
There must have been so many villages across the country, so many progressive farmers, so many aware people who have done this thing.
However, there is a need to do more today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing today that the Government of India had recently organised a magnificent exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technology has come into agriculture.
However, it remains to be nurtured to the direct farms.
Now the farmers are also engaged in reducing the use of fertilizers.
We need to behave in this mantra. We should move ahead with our agriculture sector by using scientific methods.
I hope that we will complete the required work to save water in the next one or two months.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Victory on Diabetes is the announcement of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was 1. 5 crore.
Diabetes occurred due to 3 deaths due to deaths.
Since the entire world is worried about diabetes, the theme of Diabetes has been concluded on 7th April, the World Health Day.
We all know that our lifestyle Type 2 is the main cause of diabetes .
If you like yogasana then do yogasana.
Otherwise do minimum walking , running , exercise .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We are sometimes hesitant to conduct health check-ups.
And when it gets very upset then it can be seen that diabetes has infected our body a long time ago.
This means that it is a disease which can be detected quickly.
My dear countrymen, we are doing a lot of work in this regard.
I would like to appeal to you people to tackle the menace of tuberculosis or diabetes.
And that is why I urge all the countrymen to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
On 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated across the country.
One Panchtirth - his birthplace in Mahu.
London, where he took higher education, Nagpur, where he learnt.
I am extremely fortunate to visit Mhow at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become an excellent citizen.
By following the path shown by him, we can pay a great tribute to him by becoming an excellent citizen.
In the last few days, a record commodity will start and a new record commodity will come.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can listen to your mobile phone.
We just want to give a missed call.
Make a missed call according to your convenience.
If you want to listen to the previous programme of Mann Ki Baat, you can listen to it in your own language.
I would be happy to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, many congratulations to you all.
How can this World Cup enhance the interest of sports among the youth of India
You should also participate in this.
He sent photographs of some such places, uploaded Photo that he was really happy to see them.
If you feel like watching something like a hobby-e-didar ha hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai
They should have the desire to reach the place where nobody has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Sawaner place near Nagpur, where there are coal mines.
When people go to tourist places then they buy something or the other .
If he is poor, he will take something, if he is a prince, he will spend more.
I would like to ask you a question.
Would you like to imagine a new art in these beds, a skill in your personality for achieving something new
Do not increase your strength .
You like paintings but don't you
Oh, let's start it.
Definitely use vacations for personality development, learning new arts and skill development.
There are countless sectors.
The craftsman Cook of Mysore has presented a sensitive issue to all of us.
If you ask them a question then they answer it and explain it to us.
And once you use it then see what will be useful for you in it
And if you think of something then you should complain about it.
Let us save water in every village.
How can we save drops of water in the coming rains
How can the water of the village be kept in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our landscape due to excessive use of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spices of betel nuts then would you like to eat food
You will not like the same food.
But today we have become ineffective in terms of TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on radio.
Now the thoughts of exams will start in your minds.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I believe that the more you take care of your children's examinations, the more you feel.
But if we change our perspective of looking at the examination then we can become anxious.
I had told you in the background of the programme that send me your experiences, your information on Narendra Modi Power.
I am glad that the teachers and students who have achieved great success in their lives have written a lot about it and sent it to me.
Today, I would like to speak to my parents, students and teachers especially in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard, what I have read and what I have been told, I will also tell you what I feel to myself.
But I believe that this 25-30 minute interaction will certainly be useful for the students who are going to face the examination.
My dear student friends, if I start talking to you about Mann Ki Baat today, if I do it by a well-known opener in the world, what will be useful to them while attaining the heights of success in life
Their experience will surely be useful to you.
I am aware that the examination will start in a few days.
Some of you may be under stress.
I have only one message.
Your parents will expect you, your teachers, your family members and your friends.
Wherever you go, how are you getting ready
How much quantity will you get 
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
In the last 24 years there have been many difficult moments and several times there have been good moments.
However, people used to expect and as the time progressed, the expectation continued to grow.
And for that I needed to find a solution.
Then I thought that I myself would keep my expectations and myself would set my goals.
My focus was on consciousness and then all the goals were achieved from you.
Friends, what was Tendulkar ji saying
Do not go beneath the barrier of expectations .
You have to show your future.
Do you want to spend your time in competing with others 
You will see that no one will be able to stop you from going ahead and you will achieve even greater success than the success that you have achieved before then you will not need to depend on someone else to enjoy and satisfy.
You will experience self-sufficiency.
Friends, Exams are not a game of qualities or statistics.
Where did you go, how much did you get
Or don't stubbornly stumble.
It is known from these examinations, is our speed right
And that is why if your dreams are immense, it will be a festival of joy on its own.
And that is why what will happen this year
So do not keep yourself limited .
Please move ahead with a great goal and even if there is lesser success in it, it will not be disappointed, it will be inspired to work even more zealously and with greater strength.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues from my power and their mobile phones.
In fact, the entire year, 365 days, should be favourable to our daily routine, our dreams and ideas.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy took up a matter with Mandley and slept on time and wrote in his urge to wake up early in the morning to light the study.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy says that timely access to examination centres, including entrance papers and other requirements.
Perhaps I didn't have the courage to say this because I am not serious about sleeping.
And there is a complaint of many of my friends that I do not take enough sleep.
During the examination, I would like to talk about sleeping so that you can examine in a stress-free condition.
Will you not do this or not 
I am sure you will not.
Having a discipline in life is a key factor in strengthening the foundation of success.
Not only this, daily routine also worsens.
And that is why don't understand anything small or small.
Decide, do it.
The negative impact of stress on those who are under stress falls on their fate.
And on the strength of the study that I have done, I am confident that any question paper that goes to Soden with such confidence will be solved by a question paper.
Let us know from them the path of success by cutting off this expedition.
Namaskar Me Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me begin by congratulating you for the examination.
I am going to share my experiences about how I am going to go for my examination.
Examples, I have come to know that the problems that follow you are like those that follow you.
You should rest properly, sleep peacefully at night, you should eat all your stomach, you must not be hungry and most importantly, you should remain calm.
All this is like the left of the intelligence .
When you are playing, you don't know what kind of curriculum you are going to face, you don't even know in the classes what questions are going to be raised in the examination.
That is why if you are calm and you have eaten the whole stomach , you have slept properly then you will know that your brain is reminded of the correct answer at the right time .
That's why it's quiet.
Do not put too much pressure on yourself , do not keep anxiety too much .
As a challenge, do I appeal to all those who have taught me in the year, can I solve this question
Recall the most important thing in the last minute, remember what you don't remember, when you are examining, you may recall some events with the teachers or the students and this will help you to remember a lot of things about that subject.
If you illuminate the difficult questions then you will realise that these are new questions for you and then you can solve them better when you examine them.
Therefore, keep calm, take a good night's sleep, don't show much confidence, but don't be disappointed at the same time.
I have always seen that this examination is better than you were afraid.
And while playing an international intellectual battle, you must have seen them how they sit fitly.
It is really difficult to say that but we should make efforts.
If you don't talk to friends, if you go alone, if you keep on washing the book for the last moment then your mind will not be calm.
If the water is calm then it is very deep but if the surface of the water gets dissolved then nothing below can be seen .
At that time it comes to experiencing internal tension.
Then I feel that if you rest a bit then it will be better.
I have automatically developed a system for that.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe three times or five times.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this, but after this my mind was calm and I was prepared to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will also help you.
Silver Agrawal has said a good thing.
Whatever is written on my power, at least half a day, we should spend time in happiness with our friends and families.
And what do you do
Friends, don't do that.
If you ever visit a place with your parents then you should come out of the study and exam for at least half an hour.
Rajat ji said that it is necessary to understand the issue.
Friends, Can I tell you about Shanti
Today, before you are tested, one such person has sent a message to you that there are teachers in the original form and today one economist has become a teacher.
He has been trying to consolidate this great epic Ramcharit Manas with the present and spread this culture across the country and around the world.
The revered Maurya Bapu has spoken of a clue to the students.
Friends, I would like to tell you one more thing today.
G.
But one thing is certain whether it is a student or a gurukilli in the journey of achieving the development of the second half of life.
You must pay attention to it.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, do you feel that you have a lot of time to go to the examination centre to go to the threshold and sit on your pocket
Otherwise tension arises in the mind .
If you understand that, you will not have time to regret it.
I have also seen that the nature of the uestion Paper has changed.
Shri Rao highlighted the issue of patience in his message.
Rav Saheb has also sent a beautiful message of Kamali in the words at least. You must have heard it from Bangalore.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware that due to examinations, there can be restlessness due to competitive examinations.
Don't care.
Give me the best, this is what I tell all my young friends.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life and dont leave it, you will succeed.
Don't forget that you are the lakes of this world. Like trees and mountains, you also have the right to live here.
You need that letter of dedication and dedication.
Because of these qualities you will be successful in all exams and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you all for what you have to do.
Many blessings.
"How does a scientist have a way to talk about the issue in the first place
It takes me half an hour to tell you about it in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children from all over the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination and diligence.
Friends standing firmly stood up.
If you are standing firmly then there will be fear of fear.
And the golden future will wait for you to be accomplished with your hands.
Ruchika Dabus has sent a message on my power.
And it is true that Sachin ji also said that a positive attitude, a positive state of mind, a positive energy.
Never think that there are many things that will inspire us that only students get inspiration.
Any moment in the world, any change in life, best liberalization, true event gives us immense inspiration, it gives us immense strength and at the time of crisis, we can take a new path on the strength of this inspiration.
We are reading in the information curriculum about the power divine producer Thomas Alva Edison.
Friends, Have you ever thought about how many years they had spent for this discovery
He did not have any specific education on mathematics, but he added to a variety of areas such as mathematical classification and uncertainty.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for him.
In today's era, this examination is not only for students, but also for all families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal said that the parents should not bear the burden of their expectations on their children.
And seeing this, we are not merely languishing, but we are very fond of getting hands with them.
We also want to make progress at the pace of science.
This is because today is National Science Day.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And as a reminder, on 28 February, we celebrate this day as National Science Day all over the country.
The curiosity is the mother of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to new innovations, to draw up scientific thoughts in every mind, to every generation of science.
New research is not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on the occasion of National Science Day, new innovations across the country should be encouraged.
I am Sir C.
Friends, sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when we succeed, our vision of looking at the world also changes.
You must have heard that in the last few days science has been exploring a huge and important discovery.
Scientists from all over the world have worked hard, many generations have come, they have done something or the other.
This discovery confirmed the theory of Einstein, the great scientist of the last century, and not only this, it became a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of pride that all human beings will benefit the entire world.
We are very proud and happy that the sons of our country and the skilled scientists of our country were also involved in all these research processes.
Our scientists will make efforts to further this new discovery in the times to come.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, a significant decision has been taken recently in this regard.
The Government has decided to set up LIGO India as a Laser Interface Meter Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).
There are two such centres in the world, the third will be in India.
Indias participation will give a new strength and a new impetus to this process.
India will actively participate in this great scientific discovery of human welfare with the emphasis on limited resources.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you the number one.
By giving a missed call to this number, you can listen to your mind from tomorrow.
May I also listen to your mother tongue.
81908 81908. I reiterate that 81908 is 81908.
Friends, I want to examine you tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will be examining me.
Just, tomorrow I am tested that Parva will start with you.
And only then will the country succeed when we are successful.
Friends, I wish you all the very best.
Success-incompetence is free from its tension and move forward with a free mind.
I have said two things in the last episode Mann Ki Baat.
Recently we have celebrated the Christmas festival and have started preparations for the new year.
India is nurtured by diversity.
Festivals are celebrated with fervor.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country which is based on festivals.
Whether it is terrorism, global temperature rise, natural calamity or human-made, all mankind can live in happiness and peace
You are aware that I use technology very well and I get ample information about various topics.
I always see MyGov portal.
People go to different places to celebrate the Christmas festival.
However, special attention is being given to the tourism sector to provide all the facilities but it is said that where there are tourist spots, Dharamshalas and religious places there should be special focus on cleanliness.
And as we say, "Guest Devo Bhava", when our guests are coming, we clean the house, we decorate the house.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to cleanliness in our tourist places and religious places.
In Bhojpura village in Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh Dilip Singh Malviya is a senior artisan at an age.
It came to my reading and I felt that I should reach you.
Shri Dilip Singh Malviya, a resident of Chhotayasya village, has decided that if anybody makes availability of toilets in the village, he will not get the construction wages, he will make the construction of toilets worthless.
Considering that construction of toilets is a sacred task, Dilip Singh built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my sincere regards to Dilip Singh Malviya.
This country is making rapid strides due to the uninterrupted hard work of many people.
When every Indian knows that Saray Jan Yoga has been attracted, and the entire world has celebrated International Day of Yoga and when all the world is connected, then there is a belief in our mind that this is our India.
This belief, this feeling is created in your mind only when we see a vast form.
The topic of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way.
The participation of citizens in them increases.
The biggest benefit of this thing is that those government employees who have been working to provide electricity to the villages will be satisfied and they will be happy to know that they have been working to transform the lives of a village.
Whatever government has done and which government has not done any work, it is their right to get these things and they should not lose them.
We have to make every effort so that we can reach out to them the right things, good things, the useful things of the common man.
This is a service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my behalf.
I can't do this alone, but when I tell you, I don't want to do anything.
We have to reach out to 1. 25 billion Indians.
How can I reach without your help
Let us reach them in the language of the common man and inspire them to get their rights.
My young friends, in the address delivered by the Red Fort on 15th August, I had made a first-hand discussion on the theme Start Up India Stand Up India.
After that the work started in every department of the government.
Can India become the global capital of start-ups
In a new way, with new research, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it manufacturing sector, service sector or agriculture sector.
In every case, there is a need for new ideas, new experiments and new endeavours, without which the world will not move forward.
Start Up India, Stand Up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will present a complete framework for the Start-up India Stand-up India scheme.
However, we need to change it as per the requirements of India.
Our young friends are expected to explore something that will reduce the hardships and hardships of a poor person.
I also urge the state governments to take initiative in this regard.
On January 16, I will talk to you in detail about this topic.
I will always welcome your suggestions.
Dear young friends, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda is on 12th January.
Like me, millions of people of this country have taken inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 12 January 1995.
This year, the event will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I am aware that the theme of this year is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Honey.
In his school, Excellent India Day celebrated Sulabh Sanchar Bharat Diwas and expressed his spirit on telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people who work in the society, there are many ideas in their minds.
Now it is true that every word has a different importance in itself.
The Government of India had launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan this year. However, I have not been able to attend the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan programme in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in the Mahapura region of Chennai.
However, I used to feel like going to that programme.
Therefore, I felt that in our country we should use the term 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'.
These are the people with whom there are but more or less such parts which have divine power, there is a circulation of Divya Shakti, which is not like ours.
I liked this word very much.
Why would the citizens of my country now use the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan that day.
Implementing the required infrastructure directly and indirectly, the Divyangjans will have access to these Divyangjans.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations have ramps, accessible parking, accessible transport, Braillepi.
They like this.
We should also participate in it in our own way.
My dear countrymen, the government schemes continue to come and go, but this scheme needs only artificial coins and consciousness.
We need to reach the last mile in a better way.
Their breath should not be rubbed in the files .
Because these schemes are being formulated a few days ago, the Government of India has made an effort to provide the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the poor persons and to the needy.
Grant is given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is of crores of rupees but we did not have a mechanism to ensure that it did not reach the beneficiaries in the right time.
The government has made some changes in it.
The world's largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT) has been implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account and Aadhaar Card and the grant amount has been deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
Let us proudly say that this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds largest and most successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
The scheme is known as Pahal.
Nearly fifteen crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries by the end of November.
The subsidy has been directly credited to the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for anybody's recommendation, there is no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the scheme is to open Aadhaar card, on the other hand Jan Dhan Accounts on the other hand, and on the other hand the State Government and the Central Government are working together to provide the beneficiaries with Aadhaar number and account number.
A few days ago, MNREGA will create employment opportunities in the villages.
There were several complaints about it.
My belief is that about 35-40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment for the Republic of India.
It is the centenary year of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The Constitution was specifically discussed in Parliament for two days and it was done in a very good manner.
All the parties have discussed the importance of deciding, the importance of deciding, the root cause of the incident.
Can we do the work of connecting the people with the power and the power with the people on the occasion of Republic Day
There should always be discussions and discussions about the fact that the incident has given us great powers.
It is our sacred duty to cast their votes around the time of the elections. It is our sacred duty to cast their votes.
Why doesn't it happen in the life of the people as much as we talk about our duties at the time of voting
On 26th January, when Babasaheb Ambedkar celebrated his 125th birth anniversary, the essay competition on Essay Competitions, Poetry Competitions and Essay Competitions in Schools, Colleges, Villages and Society Institutions in the city.
Twenty-two crore Indians will be able to move ahead with one step after the other with a sense of duty.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your account to MyGov.
I would like to know what the young generation of my country thinks about it.
And I am not speaking at the government level.
We build the effigies of great men with great devotion but afterwards we are obsessed with Kamali.
On the other hand, preparations for brass have also started.
Festivals in society have a special significance in themselves.
Sometimes this festival thrives with grief and sometimes creates new ones.
But sometimes during these festivals if there is a crisis then it is very painful.
Every nook and corner of the world is constantly reporting of natural disasters.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have never heard or thought about.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
The way in which there has been heavy rainfall in our country in the last few days and the way in which there has been damage in Tamil Nadu and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I am indebted to the grief of all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments are working with full force to provide relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that even after this crisis that has hit Tamil Nadu, he will start moving ahead with confidence and the role that he plays in the development of the country will be fulfilled.
But when we look at the crisis around, we need to make several changes in it.
Fifteen years ago, natural disasters were part of the agriculture sector as it was confined to natural calamities.
Today its form is changing.
At every level, we need to enhance our capacity.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small and big institutions will have to work from the point of view of science.
After the Nepal earthquake, I interacted with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and suggested that SAARC countries should come together to conduct a joint exercise to combat disasters.
I am glad that the SAARC countries had a discussion and workshop on excellent solutions in Delhi.
A good beginning has been made.
Lakhwinder Singh telephoned me from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
Mr. Lakhwinder Singh is speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We do organic farming here and guide many about this farm.
I have a question of how those people who set fire to the plants of cattle or cow cannot understand how to guide them about the death of microbes in the land and how to get rid of pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear your question.
The first thing to be happy is that you are organic farming farmers and you not only do organic farming yourself but you also know the problems of the farmers very well.
Your concerns are correct but this is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people all over India and in a traditional way we burn the remains of crops like this.
But the pain that you have expressed is correct .
First of all, we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and tell them the truth about the situation and tell them that if we burn the remains of the crops then we will be able to save time and time.
But this is not true.
We destroy it but if we do small pieces of these ruins then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, after burning it burns the upper level of the ground.
My farmer brothers and sisters, just imagine that your bones should be strong, your heart should be strong, the kidneys should be good, but if the skin of the body burns then what will happen
We cannot survive even if the heart is fit.
Just as the skin of our body burns it is difficult for us to remain alive , similarly the skin of the cook burns not only on the burning sensation of the dandruff but also the skin of the mother .
Animals can be used as fodder, they can not only save their land but if they put the fertilizer made in that land then it will be double beneficial.
The water in those pegs is sufficient for that crop and today even their pegs have got value.
They are now getting income from these pegs too.
Earlier, the pegs that had to be spent on cleanliness have become a source of income and their demand is increasing.
Dear countrymen, the next 3rd December is being celebrated as International Day of Persons with Disabilities across the world.
27th November was celebrated as India's Organ Donation Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and other eminent personalities participated in the event.
Many valuable lives can be saved by organ donation .
Organ donation provides immortality in a way.
When an organ from one body goes to the other body then that organ not only gets a new life but that person also gets a new life.
What could be the best donor
A National Registration on Organ Teeth and Organ Transplant has been launched on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense, the best help will be given to the needy because this help cannot be available till someone donates an organ.
As I have said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as the Day of Disability.
Physically and mentally challenged persons are also adventurous and capable persons.
When such individuals are neglected then they suffer.
Sometimes they are shown grace.
But if we change our vision of looking at them then we will know that these people can inspire us to lead our lives.
They can inspire to do something.
If we face a small crisis then we cry.
Then you can see that the crisis on me is very small.
How can these be our lives
How do they work
And that is why all these are inspiring places for us.
Their determination, their way of living and the power to reverse the crisis is also very powerful.
Today, I would like to tell him that he is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Jawad Ahmad was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir.
One of the diseases of stomach and intestines was also lost .
Manakya was also seriously injured.
He always lost his power to stand on his feet, but Jawad Ahmad did not give up.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
How can we develop facilities for persons with disabilities in public places, government offices
They are working on these things.
Is not the life of Javed enough to be inspiring in every corner of the country
I specially remember the work of Jawad Ahmad Ji, his penance and dedication on 3rd December.
I am not only referring to Jawad because of the short time but I have been giving several inspirations in every corner of the country.
They are giving new light to live and showing new ways.
Be it middle class, junior middle class, poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived persons, there is a constant relationship between the government and the government system. And a citizen of India has sometimes experienced the evil of some or the other government worker and he changes his vision of looking at the government system throughout his life.
It is true, but millions of people in this government do such a great job in service and dedication that we never have a vision.
Last year, we had jointly awarded Padma Vibhushan to both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever he has done after his retirement and lifelong work is being done for the poor.
When they come to India, they appreciate the hope workers who have got the opportunity to work with them. They say that they are dedicated and distressed.
They tell us how much enthusiasm they have to learn innovations.
A few days ago, the Odisha government had specially honoured an ASHA activist on Independence Day.
And a hope worker from this village, Jamuna Manisingh, decided that I will not let anyone in Tedagaon die due to malaria.
Go to every household of his family and get some fever.
There will be many more such Jamuna Mani.
Millions of people who are around us.
We have received them with a little respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How do we become a big partner in the happiness and misery of the society
I salute all such ASHA activists through 'Jamuna Mani'.
My dear young friends, I am particularly active in internet and social media for the younger generation.
Not only this, you can show it to others too, it can be a matter of concern that something can be added to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to participate in the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate change and global temperature rise are also being discussed and care is being taken. And before every work is done, it has been approved as a standard.
The temperature of the earth should not be increased anymore.
It is the responsibility of everyone and it is the responsibility of everyone.
And the first way to protect against temperature is energy saving.
14th December is the National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, we should shut the lamps on the streets and remain in the light of the moon for hours.
We should experience the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur on television it seemed as if she had not got the opportunity to study a lot .
However, he is doing such a thing that perhaps no one has thought about it.
It is brightening the lives of the poor by using solar energy.
It is fighting with darkness and igniting its strength.
She has set up a committee of women and started a factory of solar powered sugarcane and paid 100 rupees per month.
What kind of support is being given to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earning, equitable.
However, the speed at which I have to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has become good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of 66 lakh women, there are 24 lakh women, the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes, who are striving to live up to their feet with dignity.
The Abhishek himself has spoken of our enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
Someone has just told me that someone in Mumbai is a Shailesh Bhosale.
During my Swachhata campaign, I had said that Swachhata campaign is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and shailesh Bhosale has demonstrated it.
And I was told that in such a short span of time they have returned two lakh rupees to the bank.
It is working to make potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor more and more.
Indeed, these people run the economy of the country.
People of small scale industries are the economic power of the country's economy.
We want to give him more strength.
We have to move ahead but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are those things that should lead to constant awareness in social life.
"Efficiency under the National Jagriam Viyam is a prize for freedom.
How should the programme be planned
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that a lot of information was received.
But I need more information.
I expect a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I believe that your suggestions will definitely be useful.
But I would urge you to exercise.
To keep body fit definitely use some time of this good season for exercise .
If you want to enjoy the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty then you can enjoy the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty.
Once again I convey my best wishes to my countrymen.
Once again I will return to you through Mann Ki Baat.
The 5th one-day Cricket between India and South Africa is being fought.
This Cricket Malike is called Gandhi-Mandela series.
Both sides have confronted each other and therefore, the importance of the last fight has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all my sportspersons.
Today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur All India Radio.
I would like to convey my best wishes to the people of Kerala that whenever I started the Mann Ki Baat, I had met many people, the 12th students of Kerala also joined the programme.
Once again I want to talk about Kerala.
Students from St. Mary Upper Premiere School, Kochia Chittoor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I didn't realize that these kids made me a map of India by the thumbs.
When I read his letter, I came to know what a big symbolic message he had given.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency.
Writing letters from those girls, I have written to them that they should challenge people about organ donation through their Mann Ki Baat programme.
The 80-year-old Vasrao Sudke Guruji in Maharashtra has been continuously running a movement.
They say that organ donation should be a festival.
I also have a lot of messages from the telephone.
Devesh in Delhi has given me a message.
I believe that this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidney, heart and liver every year.
But in our country with a population of 125 crore only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplants are operated .
Each year one lac doll is required but only 25,000 people get eyes .
When there is a need of four rounds then we can give only one round.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have worked very well to speed up the efforts of the organ donation by reducing the paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
A lot of social institutions, a lot of NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
Ten Taken Bhunjitha is the best one to enjoy it.
Last month we had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
A creature survived.
Dear countrymen, now we have celebrated Navratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
After a few days we are going to celebrate Diwali.
Ganesh Chaturthi celebrated Eid.
However, we are going to celebrate another festival among all these things that will make our country proud, which will make the country proud.
The India-Africa Forensic Summit will be held in New Delhi from October 26-29, 2019.
This is the first time such a big event will be held in India.
54 African countries and UN Leaders have been invited.
The more the population belongs to India the more the people of Africa are.
If both the populations are united then it will become a third of the worlds population.
And it is said that the landscape of both the countries were united millions of years ago.
Later, the Indian Ocean split into two parts.
And see, it is our endeavor that people should also come together.
On this occasion, the Government of India has organized a massive programme of HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was held among the children in the schools where CBSE has affiliated schools and programmes for writing poems and enhancing their participation.
About 1600 schools participated.
It included schools from outside India and India and thousands of school children had written about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the mobile exhibition from Porbandar to Memorial of Mahatma Gandhi, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, which is moving from Porbandar to Northern State, is going to Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of school children witnessed this exhibition and people from villages also witnessed this exhibition.
People knew and knew how great Mahatma Gandhi had played on the relations between Africa and India, how great the impact of Mahatma Gandhis personality was on the two territories.
Although India-Africa is a confluence, I can see that this is an opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate Garima and the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and HRD ministry.
I had made a proposal on August 15 regarding the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month, a workshop was organised in Bhopal where the heads of the Adarsh village, the collectors there, the members of the parliament, the government of India and the state government together discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
How new things have been noticed and some enthusiastic things have been noticed.
He has selected Parsi Gram Panchayat in Kunti District of Jharkhand for the ideal village.
In the Adarsh Gram, a successful effort to make people conscious with infrastructure and system was made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate the respected Parliamentarian Shri Yut Karia Mundanji.
I received a news from Andhra.
Ashok Gajapati Rajuji Adarsh Gram Yojana, a Member of Parliament, Andhra Pradesh, was elected as the ideal village of Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Nearly 550 adult illiterates were taught and literated to them.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special system, but what a big change is brought about by the will power is being seen through the Gram Panchayat.
Our Honourable Parliamentarian Shriman C.
L. Ruwala, Member of Parliament of Mizoram.
He has chosen the village of Khwalahillang as an ideal village.
This village is very famous for the production of sugarcane and jaggery .
How can we make the village an economic centre, how can we market the village products
Ruwala ji, who tried to make a self-reliant village with an ideal village, is deserving of congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, is Mann Ki Baat and will it never happen to be a matter of cleanliness
My dear countrymen, last year after Diwali, the media had launched a special drive, all the things that had been cracked after Diwali had been shown by the channel to the masses.
We should worry about the accident before the festival, but we should also do it after the festival.
And that is why I would like to specially congratulate the Midia world of India.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I got the opportunity to participate in the Swachhta Sammelan through the India Today Group to mark one year of Swachh Bharat Mission.
I was looking at the results given by Clean India Awards. Somebody's efforts are being made.
How people are working on One Life, One Mission.
What kind of places are there in our country that have been kept clean.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan was started, I have seen that the e-Nadus of Andhra Telangana, and especially Mr.
He has added about 51 lakh children in 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is a public place or a station or a religious place or a park, a big campaign related to cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now this news shows the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News started the programme called Bharat Desh Hai Mera and people got awareness about cleanliness and trained the countrymen by encouraging them.
NDTV launched a mission called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shri Shanmukh Nathan has written to me the letter and mentioned the village of Mavallayanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has taken up the issue of cleanliness.
Almost every generation is dedicated to this cleanliness, it is said that he had received the Cleanest Village Award in Asia a few years ago.
It is important that we want to create confidence among all of us that our country will be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the people of the country. If we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 then we can proudly say 100 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, I had said this thing from the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has laid the foundation of a house.
And that is why I got the idea that what is the need of Interview for the jobs that are lost.
I have never heard such a thing. Is there a psychologist in this world who can take a few minutes to know someone completely
And I had announced this thing that we should stop the convention of begging for these jobs.
My dear young friends, today I would like to say with pride that the government has completed all these procedures and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will not be invited on the occasion of Bharati.
This rule will come into force from 1st January, 2016 and we will not be able to expend wherever the recruitment process is underway, but it will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become an important part of social life.
Gold can become a power, gold can become an economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will pay you interest on it just as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier they used to keep the gold in the locker and also used to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep it in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now the countrymen, cannot gold become a democracy
The second thing is that in Sovereign Gold Bond, this bond is a paper, but the value of that paper is gold.
On the day when this paper will be refunded, on the day of refund you will get the money as much as the price of gold.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quin.
The gold quin bringing the Ashoka cycle has been nearly 70 years since independence, but till date we have been using the Foren Gold quin.
Gold Building Bonds are also used abroad.
We are also going to make it available to the common man in the coming weeks before Dhanteras, we are launching a golden coin of 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra.
20 grams of gold will also be available for mining.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about new changes in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel is on 31st October.
An India-Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel reminded that India's map comes out.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is full of many sects, numerous sects, many dialects, many species, many perspectives, many diversity and this diversity is our pride and beauty.
If there was no diversity then we could not be proud of these beauty.
Therefore, there is a mantra of unity in diversity.
Peace, goodwill, unity is the true burden of development.
Over the last few years, on 31st October, RAN-For-Unity programmes are being organized in every corner of the country.
The path of unity is also the path of development in the true sense.
Give tributes to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, Now you must have been preparing for Diwali and it will be cleaning at home.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the festival of Diwali.
Bursting occurs due to bursting, bursting causes a lot of damage to children.
I would like to tell every mother and father that the happiness of Diwali is looted but do not let the accident happen, there should not be any harm to the children of our family.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain on the second day of Diwali.
The government of India and the state government provide scholarships to all those dalits, tribals and backward classes of the society who go abroad for study.
I believe that when our children will be taught in Britain, then Baba Saheb's place will become an inspiration for the country and Baba Saheb has given this message that I have been thrilled by my visit to Britain for so many years.
You can imagine how much people like me will be pleased with the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar that this building has become a wealth of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I will have another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Vishweshwar Ji.
Several years ago, there was a need to study the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for the cause of democracy and for the cause of Employment of Women.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Vishweshwar to the soil of London is a good example of how the great men of India thought and vision a long time ago.
My dear countrymen, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
The government officials were interacting with them.
Some people try to solve the problems by writing their problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn so many languages
However, I am grateful to All India Radio that this Mann Ki Baat broadcasts in their regional language at 8 pm in every state.
Once again my best wishes to my beloved countrymen.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October, I got the opportunity to convey my heart for the first time.
Democracy is of immense importance.
I have a fundamental idea in my life and therefore I have faith in the power of the people.
But from what I learnt from Mann Ki Baat, from what I have learnt, from what I have experienced, I can say that peoples power is more than that.
Our ancestors used to say that Jan Janardan is a part of God.
With the experience of Mann Ki Baat, I can say that there is a great power in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I would like to ask you people for information about Mann Ki Baat and I would like to see only two or four information.
But lakhs of people actively sent information.
This is a big strength.
When people were watching this, they also felt that the feeling of despair and duplicity of the daughters would have to be changed.
It was a mute revolution.
Keeping the tourism in front of India, I told the citizens, Incredible India, Incredible India, you will send a picture of your vision of tourism to me.
People from every part of India sent photographs in lakhs.
Nevertheless, the tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have a rich legacy with us.
All these things came on one platform and the government did not spend a single rupee in it.
People did all these things.
Today, I can say with great happiness and satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
I used to say this thing from Mann Ki Baat, I used to tell you that the poor households are littered, the daughters are crying, their poor mothers are painted.
Why dont they get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work very hard as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small thing is considered a small issue and tried to connect itself to the country's welfare.
What can be a bigger joy than this .
I decided to do a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I urge the citizens of the country to reach out to me through telephone.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad that more than five hundred and fifty thousand telephone calls have been received from all over the country be it Sicily, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is not a single region in India from where citizens have not telephoned.
This is a kind of pleasant experience.
The citizens of all age groups used to call them ideas.
I have heard some of them myself, I can imagine that my team works on the proposals on the other issues.
You might have taken a couple of minutes to telephone this but for me the delivery, ideas and issues that I have received are important.
The entire government will certainly work on it.
I have come to know about the importance of radio for such blind persons.
I see from a new perspective and he has said that many good things, good issues are enough to sensitize the government.
I would like to invite the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to urge the people of India to make maximum use of soil beneficiaries in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the army for two-three hours.
The Naval Staff and Air Force, which protects water, land and sky.
The 1965 war with Pakistan ended 50 years.
We used to hear about the moments of pride, pride, courage and sacrifice of our soldiers during the war, at that time photographs and cinema were not available, but this exhibition would certainly make the sense of the sacrifices of the soldiers.
Whether it is Hajifir or Northern or Chamid, the sight of the victory achieved near Hajipir Pass is thrilling on the body and the pride of the Indian army is buried in the heart.
If you want to show history then you will have to understand the smaller issues.
History keeps our bonds with our children.
Breaking the breedings of history gives a complete break to the possibility of history.
A small son has given an order to the Prime Minister, but he forgot to mention the name of himself.
And I can tell you that for the first time since Independence, there is a detailed discussion on cleanliness in the Parliament.
There were criticisms on our government.
I also had to hear a lot that Modiji used to tell a lot about cleanliness but what happened
I don't mind listening to this, but I can see a good thing that there is talk of cleanliness of India in the Parliament of the country.
And on the other hand, on the other hand, when both the households are talking about cleanliness, on the other hand, there can be no such thing for the country to run away from it.
This movement is going on. Awareness is being created about ideas, about cleanliness and cleanliness.
This will also make the government functional, it will be inevitable to work and work.
In 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we should work in that direction to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
We know what Mahatma Gandhi is saying.
At one place he used to say that if there was a time to choose between freedom and cleanliness then I would give priority to cleanliness. Cleanliness for Gandhiji after independence was more important than independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi visited Mygov.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men continue to inspire us.
It is not your job to evaluate what a great man would believe in.
All those who live for the country and those who die for the country will inspire us.
These days will provide an opportunity to remember all these great personalities.
Deendayal Upadhyaya on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jayprakash Narayanji on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
You can see any star, from the point of view of history, some great men will be associated with that star.
I once again urge you, especially for 2nd October.
On 2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by declaring a lot of expenditure is due to the help of one of your little actions.
This is the strength of the people and I once again urge you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all the arrangements with the statue of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took up this task and in the last few weeks a strong message has been received that there will be more than fifty percent of Subhash Babu's family and the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
They will often get the opportunity to meet Netaji for the first time, together, to visit the Prime Minister's residence.
But I am happy that I have never been able to visit the Prime Minister's residence before, which I will be fortunate to do in the month of October.
More than 50 brothers and sisters of Subhash Babu, family members of different countries, all the issues will be appealed.
It will be a moment of joy for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the young generation about the registration of voters, which will increase the participation of the youth in the times to come, and in the future, the young generation will be able to contribute immensely in selecting and running the government.
I hope that the youngsters who have not yet registered their names will be able to register and vote.
Kshitij Pandey, a student of seventh century, is educated in the Anaras Hindu University and in the Kendriya Vidyalaya.
Dandaga is confident about it.
At this young age I might have read a lot about it in physics.
Sadat Patel's daughter, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi.
On the other hand, she said that if not, if she takes up a book of mathematics, she opens mouthpieces and history in the evening, then she recites the essence in the evening.
All of us are surprised that I was very impressed.
Sometimes these kids get reputed but I don't know anything about Sonam.
I believe that Devan has given me a power.
I got the opportunity to meet these two children during my Kashi Yatra.
Similarly, my visit to these two children will be remembered.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are listening to my work.
Look at this, what does Sandeep of Haryana say Sir Mann Ki Baat once in a month, do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration by listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what do you do with me
Once in a month, I have to do a lot of hard work, I have to plan time.
It is a matter of pride once a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year in a way.
Do you know how to use Subhash Babu radio
From Germany, he had started his radio centre and he had always given information about the freedom movement to the citizens of India from this radio centre.
He started the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly report.
He used to broadcast this radio from English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and Parsi Urdu all languages.
I too have a year to talk to the All India Radio.
Keep sending your information, ideas and proposals.
It also benefits the government.
Improvements begin.
Your contribution, your participation is invaluable and invaluable.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of South India have painted on the occasion of Onam and only yesterday they celebrated the holy festival of Defence.
Keeping in view the social security issues, the Government of India has started several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time everyone has accepted this scheme.
I had requested my sisters to meet these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, 11 crore families have been connected to them. And I have been told that the benefits of these schemes have been given to mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I was talking to you people, the Jan Dhan Yojana has been taken up in a big way for a year.
Banking sector is also an important part of the economy and banking sector has also been strengthened to ensure that this system reaches the poor household.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Youngsters are also getting employment.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, 1 lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps will be organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Only accounts cannot be stopped by opening.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under Jan Dhan Yojana.
It is a belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again I congratulate all of you and urge all those who have opened the bank accounts to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters to keep their bank accounts unbroken.
This bank is yours, don't leave it now.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your job to keep it in mind.
Recently, due to the recent incidents in Gujarat, the entire country was disturbed by the violence and it is natural that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country will be hit first.
However, in a very short span of time all my swollen brothers and sisters of Gujarat have brought the situation under control.
And once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and fraternity are the right path and the path of development and shoulder shoulder shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi community.
I got the opportunity to listen to their thoughts and tell you the truth, as if I would like to listen to some music.
I came here to speak to the scholars about the selectiveness of their words, the liberality and generosity of the Sufi tradition in which there is a rhythm of music.
I feel very shy.
Often, there is a real need to reach out to the world of Islam.
The Sufi sect that is linked to love and pride will be a message far and wide which will benefit the human society, it will also benefit from Islam. And I also tell others that we should understand the Sufi sect, the Sufi sect and the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate to have got this invitation in the next few days.
Scholars from Buddhist traditions from all over the world are coming to Bodh Gaya in India to discuss the best interests of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am glad to receive the invitation to visit Bodh Gaya.
Indias first Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a moment of great happiness for me that I will have the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to share my thoughts with you people.
I had already mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me from my speech in Parliament, from public meetings, from Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have been telling you that the Government of India has opened its mind about the land acquisition law.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August, we had said that not only the Agriculture Department but the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are implementing this decision promptly.
Two days before the 1965 war, 50 years were completed and when the 1965 war was over, Lal Bahadur Shastri remembered Sahajik.
I salute and salute all those who have won India in the 65th War.
Such events in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi sect last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to meet the renowned scientists from all over the country and interact with them for hours.
I am happy to know that India has been doing excellent work in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it was an inspiration for me and it would have been a reinforcement of learning new things.
And I saw how many young scientists used to speak, how many dreams were seen in their eyes.
In Mann Ki Baat, I had said that students should turn to the field of science.
After this meeting I feel that there are many opportunities and there are many possibilities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends would like to look at science, our educational institutions should inspire students for it.
He has written about skill development.
Shri Prakash of Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu has stressed on the need of good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I would especially like to tell my young friends one thing.
In a speech delivered by the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that for what purpose is this interview for lower level jobs
And when there are letters for marriage then every poor family, every widow and mother come to the notice that who will get the recommendation and who will get this job with the help of someone
I don't know what words are used
Everyone had a drive and perhaps at the grassroots level was also one of the reasons.
I had said in my speech on 15th August that the government has taken rapid steps in this regard that it has been 15 days in such a short span of time.
The decision will now approximately be implemented to ensure that the notices are being sent and that there should not be any hurdle for small posts.
It is unfortunate that almost 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die every year in our country after delivery and delivery.
It is worrisome and horrible .
There has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and new devotees.
We are watching and not paying attention to television but we are not watching it.
Along with pure water, it is essential to keep small things clean at home.
Life is extremely valued.
It is not right to die due to neglect of polluted water, depression about sanitation.
Dengue testing is done at around 514 centres across the country.
Raksha Bandhan to Diwali is a period of many festivals in our country.
May each of our festivals be connected with cleanliness. See, the quality of cleanliness will automatically emerge in your nature.
I often say that we will not get the good fortune of dedicating our lives for the country but we will certainly get the good fortune of life for the country.
Two young brothers and sisters of our country, Nashik of Maharashtra, Dr.
Hindra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is making every effort to take the country forward and this is the reason that everybody is filled with pride by listening.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But my experience in the youth is different.
Sometimes we get to know and learn new things by talking to them.
I have met many youngsters who have said that I have taken the Sand on Cycle.
Cycle-Day is a definite one day in a week.
He said that it is a matter of great joy for health and environment to be better and young.
In our country, the number of cycle users in many households is increasing and many people are encouraging.
I am happy to note that today two youngsters of my country have flagged off Indias flag in the United States, so the youth of India are also thinking about it.
I specially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
It will inspire us to work with the oppressed, the oppressed, the deprived and the deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that have honoured Ambedkar.
The country can be moved forward by putting the shoulders on the shoulders.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in the farming of Kharif.
One more thing I remembered was to enjoy my heart.
Our country has always been shattered by bitterness and oil.
The poorest of the poor has to face bitterness, some oil is required for food and vegetables.
I am happy to note that the cereals that have been produced this year have increased by 50 per cent and oilseeds production by nearly 33 per cent.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, the date of 26th July has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The farmers have the same relationship with the land of this country.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers fell on hundreds of enemies.
The war in Kargil was not just a war on the border, but every city in India and every village participated in it.
It was fought for those mothers and sisters whose young sons, brothers and sisters fought against the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters who had not yet fought for the wedding, they fought for the war, they fought for the young boys who had never learnt to walk after the feet of their father.
Today, due to the sacrifices of all these people, India can speak in front of the world with utmost respect.
In a few months after our government came to power in 2014, we started the MyGov campaign on 26th July.
We have launched this website to enhance their participation in democracy to connect every citizen with development work.
And today, a year later, I am happy to say that nearly two crore citizens have visited MyGov website.
About 5. 5 lakh citizens registered their responses, and more than 50,000 citizens took out their time to register information on PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right for such people to have difficulty in getting tickets for railways 
However, this thing looks small on top but no one has ever thought that the government had not noticed this thing.
However, on the issue of Akhilesh Ji, the government took a serious note and today a separate system has been implemented for our disabled daughters and sisters for booking tickets.
There are new logos, two lines are made, programme policies are being looked at and a lot of positive information is received on MyGov.
There is a feeling of new heights in the governance system.
A new consciousness is being realized.
MyGov suggestions have been initiated in my address on 15th August.
From Chennai, Sumitra Raghavchari has suggested a lot.
I believe that this is a good idea for the citizens of the country to address this issue on 15th August.
I am sure you will make good suggestions.
I want to take care of one thing and I want to send it to you.
I don't want to preach to anyone. I don't intend to refrain from the responsibility of the central government, the state government or the local bodies.
Just two days ago, I saw a scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was getting injured for nearly ten minutes.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Amay Joshi of Pune and Ananda Kakunje of Murbidari in Karnataka have expressed concern over this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in road accidents.
However, I appeal to the parents that be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it the children of our country or be it of our country or be it the children of our country or be it
In this regard, the government has formulated a lot of new policies and initiatives, to train citizens about road safety, road safety systems or to provide immediate relief to the accidents.
Keeping all these things in mind, we will introduce the Transport and Safety Bill.
We consider taking several important steps to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Framework in the coming days.
The scheme is cashless treatment for roads in Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, from here to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
This means that we will give priority to providing medical care to those injured in the accident at the earliest 50 hours of the accident.
The Toll-free telephone number 1033 will be available all over the country to provide information about the accident.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there will be no accident in the roots because one or the other life is more important.
Sometimes I tell you that the worker should become a worker.
In the last few days, I realized that I should talk to you about it.
But how can we bring consciousness in the work done by our hands
Vijay Biswal has demonstrated how our interests and art capabilities are in harmony with our work.
I am sure one more thing I got to know about their pictures.
In Madhya Pradesh, the entire group of government officials in Harda district touched my heart with a different mission.
I liked their work and I would like to know that these officers have started the campaign operation Malayudh.
But he gave a new dimension to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
There is a village named Kashla near Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have constructed toilets in a mission mode.
Now no person in this village is going to be open for toilets and when the work of constructing toilets is completed then the village has celebrated a festival of happiness.
This is an excellent example of how the values of social life change, how the mindset of the people changes and how the citizens of the country are leading the country on the path of progress.
From Guwahati, Bhavesh Deka has written about questions related to North Eastern Province.
However, the people of North-Eastern Province are active.
They will go to the village, they will talk to the officers of the administration there, they will speak to the representatives and the citizens.
They will understand their problems and they will do whatever is possible by the central government to solve these problems.
This is a good effort, an effort to go far east from Delhi, a East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and happiness for all of us.
We know this story but we don't care about it.
I would like to tell the officers that IAS officers of the government should go to a school, college, two or four hours a week and interact with the students there.
This work is difficult but we have to do it.
In the examination period, there is no electricity, so do not fall into the study of children.
If we want to start a small business in the village then we will have electricity.
At some places, we have to move to other villages to charge the mobile.
We must do this, we have started it.
Today, I felt that Mann Ki Baat should talk to you about different topics.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your suggestions and new ideas for August 15th.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I realized that something was less.
We used to hear a lot of things in the form of a self-dependence among the families of 130 crore Indians, in a very small atmosphere.
Sometimes these things were inspiring for you people.
You can imagine how the spectacle of spectacles have been created in this midst.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - 11 a.m.
Every moment I felt that I used to miss something.
And whenever I speak Mann Ki Baat, I speak alone, and that word may be mine, the voice might be mine, but that story is yours, it is your personality, it is your valour and valour.
I used only my words and my speech.
There was a feeling of complete vacancy in the mind.
Once the elections are over, let us talk to you about four things immediately.
But afterwards they thought that no
It is our Sunday programme and it should continue to do so.
However, these reports only brought a lot of wait.
Small, simple, simple and inexplicable things are also causing change in the lives of the society.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in a sense, we have to move ahead with this sequence by giving strength to the spirit of New India and energy.
In the last few months, many messages have been delivered, and innumerable people have said Mann Ki Baat is being missed.
Whenever I read this message, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from Aham to Vyam.
This silent interaction with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have raised a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath in the Dhoomi of the elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will have the curiosity to know the answers to these questions.
I believe that the slightest breakdown given to Mann Ki Baat had created a feeling of vacancy in my mind, perhaps in the valleys of Kedar, in that solitary cave, I would have got the opportunity to fill up this pocket.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar's visit, your efforts to strengthen one positive thing, I feel consistent with your speeches.
The letters that come in for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are routine, are different from the daily government work.
Sometimes the letters that you have sent are the reason for inspiring me in a way.
In some cases, the work to sharpen my thought process makes you a few words.
The challenges faced by the country and society make me understand from the people.
At the same time, people are saying that what is the answer to these problems.
I have seen that people ask for their problems in the papers and also what is the answer to them.
Answer to the synergy of questions, some or the other new ideas, direct or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like a gem for the country and society.
Today, my heart is filled with joy.
Last time I had said that we had met in three or four months, some people had given a political meaning, people had said, Modi Ji has so much confidence and he has so much confidence.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
You all took the form of trust.
And that is why I had easily said in the last Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I would like to talk to you.
You have settled here and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
If we move ahead with this feeling then we will continue the sequence of Mann Ki Baat as before.
The movement was not limited to the archives.
The hearts and minds of the people were frustrated.
Democracy seemed to be a kind of stir in the minds of the poor.
When we get food from time to time, we don't know what hunger is.
Similarly, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country used to feel that during the Emergency, you have lost something.
Even if someone shook the thing that we had never used, it was the same pain and suffering.
Some arrangements have been made in the event of India and democracy has come to an end.
There is also a need to drive a social system.
Laws and regulations are also required, rights and duties are also discussed.
But India can proudly say that for us there is a value of democracy that has been greater than the laws and regulations.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our legacy.
And with this legacy, we have become a child.
Therefore, the country had sacrificed a complete election for the protection of democracy, not for our own sake.
We have easily adopted the precious democracy that we have received.
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if the world becomes very popular then I would say that if one leaves China then more people have the right to vote in India than any other country.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
You can imagine how much resources and human resource will be required to carry out this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff worked day and night to overcome the elections.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces have fulfilled their responsibilities to make this great democracy a success.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laid down their lives.
You can imagine the expanse of the total election.
All the voters had made all this suppression so that they could not be deprived of their voting rights.
In remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, we were setting up a polling station for a female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two or two days to reach that remotest place.
Besides, there was one thing to say that we should take pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and to all those who have participated in this election process and bow down to the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you must have heard from my mouth that it is my urge to book, not book.
We can all welcome books instead of flowers.
On hearing this, people have started welcoming books at many places.
Someone recently gifted me a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahania'.
I liked this visit.
However, I have not been able to get a lot of time but during the journey I got the opportunity to share some of his stories once again.
Premchand has made a real picture of the society in his stories and when he reads it, the picture of that period could be produced in front of his eyes.
Every detail written by him, every thing becomes alive.
Their stories seem to be a part of the spirit of the entire India.
While reading the story of 'Nasha', he wrote, I myself started asking questions about the economic imbalance in the society.
I remembered my youth.
We used to debate over the economic imbalance of the society overnight.
The sensitivity of a child, the immense value of his life, the maturity of his thoughts at such a young age was observed in this story.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to our country with a stick from the fair, the human sensitivity reaches a very high altitude in the true sense, it will make the reader extremely emotional at the last moment.
In this story, a lively portrait of the life of a poor farmer can be read.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated in the dense forest of Idukki.
Primary teacher P.
Murlidharan and P.
V.
Chinnathampi or both of them started a library of tireless hard work.
Sometimes these two books were made of books and books were put on our backs in our villages of the forest.
Today this library, along with the tribal children of this place, is working to give a new direction to everyone.
Gujarat's 'Gujarat' campaign was a great success.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this mission and read books.
In today's digital era, during the time of Google Guru, I urge you to keep books in your daily work for a while.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of great happiness for me that not only do the people of our country think of the present times but also think of the future challenges.
When I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I noticed that many people have written a lot about the water problem.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Vijay Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the water-related challenges.
May the water be equal to mothers and be blessed with the blessings of the mother like water, may the grace of the mother be upon us.
Due to lack of water every year there is drought in many parts of the country.
We save only eight per cent of the water, so now we need to solve this problem.
Just as all of us have solved many other problems by public participation, Jan Shakti, similarly one hundred and thirty crore Indians will be able to find solutions to the problem of water with all their capabilities, with all their collaboration and determination.
Keeping this in mind the importance of water is the highest, we are now setting up a new Jal Shakti Ministry in the country.
This will facilitate faster decision-making on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to do something differently.
I have written letters to Sarpanchs from all over the country to Gram Pradhan.
In order to save water, to store water, not to drop drops of rain or to save rain water, the heads of the village should discuss the issue of Gram Sabha.
It has been resolved to save every drop of water in villages and villages and save rain water.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people of that place have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the villagers, all the Sarpanches and all the Sarpanches for their active efforts to save water.
Several institutions across the country have made such a solemn pledge for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of that village are now competing to build a Jal Mandir in their villages.
I have said before that that if collective efforts are made then they get very positive results.
There cannot be only one specific formula for water conservation across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But the goal is the same and that is water conservation, water conservation.
Work is being done to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water conservation.
The lives of the people of the village are changing as water ponds are being constructed at Thimpalli in Telangana.
The small ponds that have been constructed in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a big change.
I had read about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I am also reading that the women in Garhwal have been working together with the help of Rainwater Harvesting in a very good manner.
I believe that when all of us are united and striving hard, it is impossible.
When everybody participates in the work of water conservation, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the countrymen about three things.
My first appeal is - just as the countrymen have made the Swachhta campaign a movement, similarly, for water conservation, we have to start a mass movement.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is a prasad given to God.
Earlier they used to say that the touches of Paris were made of iron.
I say that water is perfect, and the touch of water is creating a new life.
A awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water.
We should make the society aware and connect the society.
I urge you all to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar at the birthplace of revered Bapuji then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu.
That is why I always say that if someone goes to Kirti temple then he must see the storage of water.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people to take up water conservation.
You all can share your information using JanshaktiForJalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude for one more thing.
The President of many countries across the globe, the Prime Minister, the dignitaries and the common man, briefed me on how Yoga Day has been celebrated in their respective countries.
On that day, the whole world looked like a happy family.
Therefore, the propagation of Yoga is a great work of social service.
Why don't those service provide recognition and respect
The Prime Ministers Award for outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga was announced in 2019.
This thing is inspiring.
Now the topic of Yoga is going on, Indians are not lagging behind in this field.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also been honoured and dedicated to the cause of Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, our journey begins today, new emotions, new feelings, new resolutions, new strengths, but I will wait for your advice.
Let us continue to meet, we will continue to speak.
I listen to your feelings and keep in mind.
Sometimes I try to create that feeling.
This is how our blessings are received.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again I will meet next month on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terror attack in Pulwama, there has been a strong feeling of sadness in the hearts of the people of the country.
Condolences are being expressed about the brave soldiers and their families who have been martyred.
The feelings of intense anguish against such violent violence are in our hearts and minds, the same feelings are in the minds of every countryman and of the humanity of the entire world.
I salute all the brave sons of our country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown extraordinary courage and valour.
Where they have demonstrated their magnificent potential for peace.
There, he has given a detailed response to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how action was taken within a hundred hours.
Ram Niranjan ji, the father of Shahid Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, who showed his courage in such a sad event, is inspiring for all of us.
We will send our second son to the army to fight against the enemy and if necessary we will fight ourselves.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Netaji, the wife of Jagatsinghpur, in Odisha.
He has also decided to recruit one of his children in CRPF.
When Gumla village in Jharkhand, the martyr Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in a tricolor, was killed by his son.
The courage shown by these innocent children is the feeling of every young child in India today.
This kind of feeling is seen from the houses of our brave martyrs.
It is not an exception to any of our brave martyrs that their family is not an exception.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya or the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of Shahid Hemraj of Kotta, the story of every family of the martyrs is inspiring.
We will not need to look at the old events in history to know what is the penance.
These are examples of movement in front of our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for India's bright future.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for several years.
Therefore, it is natural for the countrymen to have curiosity and curiosity about it.
Mr. Onkar Shetty, a resident of Uppi, Karnataka on the NarendraModi App, expressed happiness that the National War Memorial has been completed and constructed.
It is a memorial that will preserve the glorious valour of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to make it an inspirational monument in the country.
We decided to set up a National Soldiers Memorial and also started the Direct Work.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, this National Military Memorial, we are going to deliver crores of Indians to our armed forces.
The country will make a very small effort to repay the debt on us.
This new memorial has been constructed near the place called the heart of Delhi, the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyot Part.
I am sure that the vision of the people of the country will be so sacred to visit this National Soldiers Memorial.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation for the supreme sacrifice made after Independence.
The construction of this memorial will showcase the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on four central cycles, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrs.
The glow of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyrs .
The defence cycle that follows is reflecting security.
There are rows of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are a symbol of soldiers and they are giving a message of trust to the citizens of the country, every clock is sailing on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Someone will come here to know the valour of these brave soldiers and they will be able to get the information of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country so that they can keep the country safe, keep alive and develop the country.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary Forces are not really capable of contributing in the development of the country.
I am sure all of you should be grateful to the men and women police personnel who continue to work for our security.
I hope all of you will visit the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
It will also inspire others to visit this holy place and they will also be eager to visit this holy place.
When I was reading the reactions from you people, I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to Aishwarya Mukhopadhyay Ji.
He has written that on 3rd March, 1900 the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And it is a matter of Yoga that it is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
Both have come from different backgrounds but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, we have to pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata, in a way salute the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brightened not only Jharkhand but the entire nation.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, it is Lord Birsa Munda who can be named as a guide for our youngsters.
When Birsa Munda fell asleep, the British wrapped them up and chased them.
Do you know why the British had to accept the path of retreat to capture Munda
The reason was the fear of the British Munda who created such a large empire.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional blessings, had shook the British government with guns and guns.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership, then the collective will power becomes stronger than the strength of the armed forces in front of the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done everything in their minorities.
In the blind life of the deprived and exploited one has been brought to light like sun rays .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the age of 25 years.
The son of Mother India like Birsa Munda has taken place in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifices, valour and sacrifices of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If the personality like Lord Birsa Munda makes us realize its existence then the personality like Jamshedji Tata has created a large institution in the country.
Jamshedji Tata knew that India must become a hub of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Not only this, he established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Once Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand Ji had visited the ship during their visit to America, there were discussions on various topics.
This was the foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the new Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai, was born on 29 February.
You all are well aware that this date comes once in four years.
Simple, peaceful personality Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget most of the time in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India during the difficult times when the country's democracy was in crisis.
Morarji Bhai Desai humbled himself in the movement against the imposition of democracy.
He had to calculate a huge price in his old age.
At that time the government had put them in a hurry.
He became the Prime Minister of the country when he was elected in 1977 by the Janata Party.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights obtained under articles 20 and 21 of the Census shall not be abrogated either during the period of enactment.
Morarji Bhai had amended the Emeribani Lawns, 1975 that the way democracy was assassinated, it should never be repeated in the future.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very excited about the Padma Awards.
We feel that those people who work in a selfless manner for the people at the grassroots level should be respected and respected for their work.
Many people have been making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by taking immense hard work.
The people who are working selflessly in public service, social service and the nation service that is bigger than all are Karmayogis.
These are the true activists who are far from the world of fame, who do not care whether they are called or not.
He believes in work: Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam The message of Gita is a direct world.
I would like to talk to you about such people today.
Friends, these rare paintings are working to reach the new generation.
The Tri of Life art work by Abdul Ghafoor was presented to the former US President, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the standards of Padma awards, Shabbir Sayeed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gomati.
The way they have dedicated their lives to the service of goddesses, their work is different from that.
Even after the age of centuries, many people of the world are training Yoga.
Till now, he has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers and Jamuna Tundu, famously known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has done two-handed work with the Timber Mafia and the Nuclears and saved 50 hectares of forests from devastation.
Due to the hard work of Jamuna Baiji, now the villagers in that area plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their homes.
They have worked in this direction to empower women and how farming can be beneficial.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from our region to join the Self Help Groups to become economically self-reliant.
This change in the list of award winners is a new image of India that is changing in a way.
My dear countrymen, if a heart-breaking experience has just come to me then I will tell you here today.
Today, wherever I go to the country, it is my endeavor to meet some beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have noticed that this scheme is transforming the lives of the poor.
If a poor person cannot afford medicines, then you must inform him about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the examination season in schools is going to start now.
The examinations of the 10th and 12th examinations will begin in the next few weeks to be conducted by different boards across the country.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the parents and teachers of all the students on examination.
A few days ago, a big programme called Exam Pear Discussion was organised in Delhi and the Town Hall was organised as a programme.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-fourth interaction through PRAGATI - the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance.
This will definitely benefit the students.
All the students, their teachers, parents can see the full recording of this programme on YouTube and convey my best wishes to all the experimental warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, we are discussing India and we cannot talk about festivals.
This is because we have a thousand years old culture and tradition that benefits us.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Kashi a few days ago, I had got the opportunity to spend some time with the Divyang brothers and sisters of Kashi.
And it was a pleasant surprise to hear a copy of it for me.
The way I speak in Mann Ki Baat, those disabled youngsters will imitate the same methods.
It means that people just listen to Mann Ki Baat and leave it alone.
I was really impressed by the strength of that disabled young man.
My dear countrymen, it is a great experience for me to be associated with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, I interact with crores of families every month through radio.
Sometimes, while talking to all of you, reading the letters you sent or on telephone, I feel that all of you have considered me as a member of your family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Election is one of the biggest celebrations of democracy.
In the next two months, all of us will be present in the dawn of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Respecting the strong democratic tradition, Mann Ki Baat will be the last Sunday of May.
This means that the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May will go for three months.
After the election of all our emotions in this period, with a new confidence and with the strength of blessings of all of you, once again we are going to start a programme to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat and for many years we will continue to talk to you.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us to follow our responsibility by working hard, that is, the residence of Lord Shiva is like staying in Kailashdham.
His fame was a scholar who had a unique reputation on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He had lived his entire life to provide food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
I have often been fortunate to receive the blessings of revered Swamiji.
In 2007, for the centenary year celebrations of Shri Shivkumar Swami ji, our former President Dr.
Kalam Saheb had listened to a poem for revered Swamiji.
This poem by Dr Kalam Saheb, U Received Happiness Alliance Will Blace, All Your Actions presents the life of Shri Shivkumar Swami Ji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
On 25th January, the Election Commission was formed, which is celebrated as the National Voters Day, on the vast level of elections held in India, the people of the world are surprised to see that every countrymen is proud of the Election Commission in view of the efficiency that their Election Commission manages.
Every citizen of India who is a registered voter in our country.
No one leaves any stone unturned to ensure that there is a registered voter and he gets an opportunity to vote.
In Himachal Pradesh, polling stations are also being set up at a height of 15,000 feet from the sea level, while voting is being done on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just imagine, for a voter.
When we hear these things, it is natural to take pride in the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy that the Election Commission employees should go to far-flung areas to ensure that they get the opportunity to use their franchise keeping in mind the voters.
I appreciate the Election Commission which has consistently tried to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the younger generation to register as voters if they are eligible to vote.
At the same time, it is my duty to cast a vote.
We have to realize this responsibility.
This is our tendency, our tendency.
It should be our culture.
I appeal to the renowned person of the country to collectively register a voter or to make people aware by running a campaign for voting.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some amazing and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multi-dimensional Basundhara.
One of these great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his birth anniversary.
On the occasion of Netaji's birth anniversary, I got the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
We are aware that many rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort have now been converted into a very beautiful museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Indian National Army.
The museum dedicated to Yad-e-Jallia and 1857 attained fitness consumption , India's First War of Independence and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as a revolutionary temple .
Everyone in this museum has the aroma of our glorious history.
Thai Thai Thai Thais inspire us to see the legends of the heroes of our freedom struggle in history.
At the same place, the British Rajvatin had launched the brave son of Mother India - Col Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurubaksingh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I used to visit the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, then the family members of Netaji gave me a very special cap cap.
Netaji used to do that hat.
I have given that cap in the museum so that the people coming there can see that cap and take inspiration from it.
In fact, our heroes need to embrace valour and patriotism in different ways to the new generation.
A month ago, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
In a programme, the tricolor was thrown at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose had tri-colored 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the Tricolor broke out in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because here is the tradition of August 15.
The establishment of Azad Hind Government was completed 75 years on this occasion.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Delhi Chalo, let me die, I will give you a lot of brilliant announcements like 'Azadi Dunga' and Netaji took a place in the heart of every Indian.
I am glad that we have been able to do this thing for years to bring the files related to Netaji to everyone.
I remember Netaji's family who had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
All of us together made a gap on several issues related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that several places related to the great heroes of India have been developed in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir related to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered connectivity with radio people as an important medium, as well as Netaji had not been very close to radio and he had also chosen radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu started Azad Hind Radio and used to interact with the soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of commencement of his Radio address.
First of all, he used to say, "Dhis Is Subhash Chandra Bose Speaking to You Over the Azad Hind Radio" and listening to it, he used to say that there was a new zeal, a new zeal in the audience.
I was told that this radio station used to broadcast weekly reports which were given in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, West and Urdu.
The Radio Station is being run by the resident M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast by Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programme gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been established in this revolutionary temple.
An attempt has been made to demonstrate the extremely attractive methods of Indian art and culture.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 centuries old paintings and artworks.
The museum has exhibited excellent art exhibitions from great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravivarma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jemini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge all of you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you may be wondering that there is a discussion of art here and I am telling you about the excellent artwork of Gurudev Tagore.
Till now we have recognized Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev is a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
They have also taken out pictures of animals and birds, they have also taken out a number of beautiful natural images and not only have they done a lot of human characters on the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that he did not give any name to most of his pictures.
They believed that their painters would themselves understand the meaning of the painting, the meaning of their message from the paintings would be understood from our point of view.
Their painting exhibitions have also been exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope that we will definitely see their paintings in Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of Saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message in a very short span of time.
He used to say that when a person does not get involved in the slaughter of bananas, then there is nothing left beneath the leaves and the ends of the leaves, but when the whole tree is finished, the humans have lost their lives in different races and humans have not remained.
He used to say that if God was in fact in every person, then it would not be right to share it on a religious and other social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It will not be wrong to say that he explained the true meaning of labour to the world.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think about going beyond the sky, I appreciate our ideas and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has been an important contributor to Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
On 24th January the Kalam-Set launched by our students.
The sounding rockets made by the university students in Odisha have set up several records.
Nearly as many space missions have been launched in the last four years since independence.
We have also made a global record of releasing 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technology to protect livelihood and property.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technology is helping in all these things.
Our fishermen brothers and sisters have been given navy devices, which are helpful in economic upliftment along with their security.
We are using space technologies to further enhance the disbursement and accountability of government services.
Under the Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses have been geo-tagged in about 23 states.
At the same time, under MNREGA, about three and a half crore people have lost their lives.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the growing power of the country today.
Our excellent relations with many countries of the world are very important.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also visited our neighbouring friendly countries for development.
Through our immense competitive launch service, India today launches not only the developing country but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always a big attraction for children.
Our space programme provides an opportunity to our children to move ahead with the limits that they have been able to understand.
Our vision is to keep our children watching the stars, explore and inspire new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the one who plays will open it. And here in Khelo India, a lot of youngsters and youngsters have emerged openly.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When a sportsperson performs best at the local level, he will do the best in the world.
In Khelo India, sportspersons from every state have performed well at their respective levels.
Many sportspersons who have won medals will give life a tremendous inspiration.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Haveli, the captain of Maharashtra's 21-year-old Women's Custody Federation, is a resident of Satara and a very young girl went to her and encouraged her brother and her maternal grandmother's skills.
It is often seen that girls do not get any encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
In spite of this, Sonalin chose Kabbaddi and performed excellently.
The 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won the Gold Medal at White Weightlifting.
Their widows are farmers in Belgaum.
When we talk of building India then New India is the resolve of the youth power.
Not only the big cities, but also the youngsters from small towns, villages and towns, youngsters and young sporting talents are also making a big contribution in the creation of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about a number of prestigious list of contests.
The name of this event is Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya.
People are making their toilets clean, painting and making them beautiful, we can see the pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media too.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and village heads to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Definitely put a lot of pictures on your clean beautiful toilets with Mylzatghar on social media.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, all of us started a journey that will always be remembered together to make the country clean and open defecation free.
Today, India is moving ahead towards becoming Open Defecation Free before 2nd October, 2019, so that I can pay my homage to my fathers on their 150th birth anniversary.
The resident of Himachal Pradesh, Ashtul Sharma, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exams.
Thank you for presenting this issue.
For many fairs the first part of the year is a testimony.
Students, from their parents to teachers all are engaged in examination related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would have liked to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat, but you will be happy to know that after two days, I will be interacting with students from all over the country at 11 am on 29th January, along with students, parents and teachers will also participate in this programme.
Several foreign students will also participate in the event.
I will certainly put forward some of these ideas and information in the Town Hall programme.
You can also see the same live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of the revered Bapu.
At 11, the entire nation pays homage to the martyrs.
You should also pay homage to martyrs for two minutes.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
The year 2018 will end.
And then it benefits the experiences, and there is also confidence in selecting.
What can we do, which will transform our lives and contribute to the society and the country
I convey my best wishes to all of you in 2019.
You must have decided to keep this in mind for the year 2018.
It is also important that the year 2018 will be remembered as a country as the strength of one hundred and thirty crore people.
And it is also a matter of pride for us.
In 2018, the world's largest Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's prestigious institutions recognize that India is working to eradicate poverty at a record pace.
With the unwavering resolve of the countrymen, the coverage of sanitation has been moving ahead by 95.
For the first time since independence, the Tricolor was thrown at the Red Fort on the 75th Foundation Day of the Azad Hind Government.
The country got the world's tallest statue of Statue of Unity in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who laid the foundation of unity.
The country's name was raised in the world.
The UN's highest environmental award Champion of the Earth was conferred on the nation.

The first meeting of the Global Solar Alliance was held in India.
Our collective efforts have led to an unprecedented growth in the ease of doing business in India.
The country's defence efficiency has become stronger.
This year our country has successfully completed the nuclear triangle, that is, now we have embedded the embankment in all the three regions of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
The country's daughters travelled the world through the sea circuit and the country's survival was filled with pride.
Indias first climate began in Varanasi.
That is why revolution has started in the waterways sector .
The country's longest rail-road bridge was inaugurated and the 100th Pakyong airport in Sikkim was inaugurated.
India also won the 19-year-old crystals world wide, blind cricket world wide.
This year, India earned a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India has also made good strides in the Para Asian competition.
If I talk about the collective endeavours of every Indian then my Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will emerge.
All this has been possible only by the tireless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we have met some exceptional Indians in December this year.
On December 19, 19, Dr. Javendran died in Chennai.
Doctor Jasendran is known as the cheapest treatment to the poor.
People say that they used to be careful for the patients.
On this website, I have read a number of articles about the work that inspires their society.
Similarly, Sulagitinarasamma of Karnataka died on 25th December.
Earlier this year, he was honored with Padmashri.
There are several persons like Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city provide free treatment to poor patients by organizing camps.
Every month such shibirds are taken from the Heart Long Critical Care Programme here which has the facility of free treatment of many types of diseases .
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors , who are doing the patient carelessly , is really worth noting .
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh had launched the Swachhta Abhiyan.
I'm still thebeterindia.
I am sure that this will provide information to more and more people about our novels that bring about changes in the society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, many good things are happening around us in the society.
And all this is being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played, those who watch it also get energy.
We see a lot of fame, identity and dignity of sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many things that are more than the world's sports.
I would like to tell you about Kashmir's brutality and she won a gold medal in the Karate event in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanaya taught and practiced karate with hard work and proved himself.
I pray for the bright future of all my countrymen.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there was a lot of discussion among the media about the 16-year-old Rajni girl.
Rajan said that his parents have done a lot of hard work to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to leave for work every morning before Rajni and his emotions arose.
When Rajani expressed his desire to learn about the problem, the Father collected all the resources and enhanced his enthusiasm.
Rajni had to use old gloves to carry out a serious war because the financial condition of his family had to be checked.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni could not be squeezed.
She has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh and Usha Rani for helping Rajni and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian to travel the world.
It was running around 300 kilometers of cycle daily for 159 days.
You can imagine that 300 kilometers of cycling everyday
Her cycle obligation is truly worth the accounting.
Whether we are inspired by such achievements or not
Especially when my young friends hear about the phenomenon, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the barriers.
If you decide, if you have the power to resolve, then all the problems automatically vanish.
No problem can be obstructed.
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals like Lodhi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals, the color of traditional dances will be displayed somewhere in the country of Sanaur, and iron will be burnt somewhere in the joy of Sugi.
After this the day starts to grow gradually and winter season starts .
Many congratulations to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Unity in our festival diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is a part of our ethos.
We can see how similar our festivals have been to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, individuals and communities are the same.
Excellent examples of our close relations with nature are calendars based on festivals.
This is not only the festival of the year but also the information about planets and constellations.
From this traditional calendar we get to know how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the number of moons and the sun calendar is fixed .
It depends on the calendar that counts .
Celebrations are also celebrated in many parts according to the status of constellations.
Gudhi khoda, Chetichand and Ugadi are celebrated as lunar calendars, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated as sun calendars.
River and water conservation have special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath is a festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
Even on Makar Sankranti lakhs of people take bath in the holy rivers .
Our festivals also teach us about social values.
On the one hand they have ancient significance, on the other hand, every festival is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of 2019 and wish you a lot of happiness.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can take pride in and can show pride to the entire world and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from all over the country come there and they are always associated with the Kumbh Mela.
In the Kumbh Mela, the people of faith and devotion have lost their lives.
In one place, millions and millions of people from within the country and abroad have come together.
The tradition of the Kumbh is embodied and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
Since 15th January this year, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organized in Prayagraj, which you may be eagerly waiting for.
Saint-Mahatma Prayagraj has started reaching for the Kumbh Mela since now .
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the backdrop of the unparalleled cultural traditions of humanity, so that we can imagine its global importance.
A few days ago, the ambassadors of many countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh.
At that time the national flag of many countries was hoisted at one time.
People from more than 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
With the divinity of the Kumbh, India's magnificence will illuminate its diversity throughout the world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium for self-discovering and every person coming here feels different.
Especially for the youth this is a very big academic experience.
I myself had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and I have seen that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on at a rapid pace.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh Mela.
This year, emphasis is also being laid on cleanliness at Kumbh.
In the Kumbh event, along with cleanliness, if you pay attention to cleanliness then its good message will reach far and wide.
This year, the future Triveni will also be able to observe Akshayvat after the holy dip in the Sangam.
This akshayvat, which symbolises the faith of the emotional, was shut down in a fort for many years, so even if it was a wish, it could not see the emotional one.
But now the doors of the fort of Akshay Vat have been opened for all.
I would urge you that when you visit Kumbh Mela, you must upload some photos of the Kumbh Mela on social media, it will inspire more and more people to visit this Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality become the Mahakumbh of philosophy for Indians in India.
This Kumbh of artistry should also become the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, all our countrymen are very excited about the 26th January Republic Day celebrations.
There is an unbreakable bond between revered Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan became a Mahatma from South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firmly against casteism.
He also established Finnics and Tolstoy Farms, from which the voice for peace and justice was raised all over the world.
This year 2018, Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as a Jan Shatabdi Year and is also known as Madiba.
Nelson Mandela, we all know that it is an ideal in the fight against apartheid all over the world.
He was blessed with the inspiration and valour of Bapu for so many years.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not just a source of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals always encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, just a few days ago, there was a DGP Summit at Narmada in Gujarat at Kevadia where the world's tallest statue is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed deliberations were made on how steps should be taken to empower the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the opening of the Sardar Patel Awards for National Unity and in any way the people who contribute to national unity will be honored with this award.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity uninterrupted.
Sardar Patel used to believe that Indias true strength is united in its diversity.
Respecting their spirit, we are paying homage to them through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, a long time in his life, North India was his karmabhoomi and he spent his entire life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the end of life in Nanded.
Thus, in a sense, the whole year received their blessings.
If we look at their lives then we can see the reflection of the whole of India.
After the martyrdom of father Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji obtained the post of Guru in the nine-year-old Alphons.
Guru Govind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice in the form of a legacy from the Guru .
His personality was calm and straightforward, but whenever an attempt was made to smile the poor and the weak, when injustice was done to them, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said that...
Twenty-two lakhs of boys and girls, they used to say that it is not right to demonstrate our strength by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji believed that it is the biggest service to alleviate human suffering.
He was an excellent tricolor, as well as a master of many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Farsi, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country that are not discussed at large.
I. e. Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority.
I am working to promote safe and healthy habits of diet.
Only when India is clean and healthy can India prosper.
Nutritious diet is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, the FSSEs have been enhanced.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations on this initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this programme.
I would like to say that we should also participate in it and especially the children should show these things.
The important point of view of diet is to get education from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last ever programme of 2018, let us meet once again in 2019.
Whether it be of an individual, of a nation or of a society, inspiration is the foundation of the progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with this new inspiration, new zeal, new resolve, new accomplishments and new heights.
On 3rd October, 2014, through Mann Ki Baat on the holy occasion of Vijaya Dashami, we all started a journey together.
Only one person was a shield.
There was no clothing on the dhaba for despair.
He had constructed a tapari like a tapari on the road side.
There was talk of Radio at that time.
It should reach far-flung areas of the country, from the far-flung villages to the metro cities, from the farmers to the young professionals.
Recently, All India Radio has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have noticed that some of the implications from that survey are very different and cautious.
Of the people who have been surveyed, 70 of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat is a major contributor to increasing the positive spirit of the society.
This is a reflection of the positive emotions of our countrymen.
Many people have also experienced that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of voluntaryism and voluntary action.
There has been a change in the way people are coming forward with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm for social service.
I am very happy to see that Mann Ki Baat is now gaining popularity of radio.
But radio is not the only medium in this journey.
Thank you very much for phone calls.
The doubt that you have made is absolutely correct.
However, if a leader was given a mic and millions of people used to listen to him then what else would be there
They used to study which words were used repeatedly.
The practitioners have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, I had decided that there should not be politics in it, there should not be any government support in it.
My solemn pledge has been greatly inspired by you and I have been inspired by you.
It is evident from the letters that came before every part of Mann Ki Baat, online tips, and the telephone calls that had come up.
Modi will come and go, but this country will continue to grow, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will continue to live.
Someone writes to me from a distant place in the country and tells me that people should not make much money with small shopkeepers like us, those who run auto rickshaws, those who sell vegetables.
Now a campaign like Selfie with Daughter can be started in a small village in the state of Haryana and spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government word.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of aspirational India.
If you want to answer the question that you have asked in a simple word, then you can say that nothing is being prepared.
Mann Ki Baat is a very simple thing for me.
Because every time I get letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
By calling this number, people record their message in their voices.
Before every part of Mann Ki Baat, I try to get the maximum number of letters and tips for myself.
My countrymen have been living in my heart every moment. And that is why whenever I read a letter then the situation of that journalist, his feelings and feelings become a part of my thoughts.
In such a scenario, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
In fact, this is my voice in Mann Ki Baat, but all the examples, emotions and inspiration are of my countrymen.
There are millions of people whom I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat, but these people dont have any objection, they send their letters.
Efforts are also made to ensure that all the letters which cannot be replaced in Mann Ki Baat and the concerned departments take care of their suggestions.
It is because of their hard work that Mann Ki Baat can reach the maximum number of people.
A team of All India Radio prepares for broadcast in different languages.
Some people simply hear the Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in Shaili.
They become Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate them and thank them for their humility and their skills.
I urge you all to listen to this programme in your local language as well.
However, many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat were raised by the media.
There are several topics like Swachhta, Road Safety, Open Defecation Free India, Selfie with Daughter, which the media has developed innovative ideas and made them a campaign and worked in that field.
Without our cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our forearms also stand like a very big crisis in conversation .
Apart from accepting, accepting and reacting, I prefer to understand what the people of the front say.
Generally, there were discussions about the Communication Gap between the elderly, the elderly and the daughters of Kumar Vyogtali.
In fact, in most households, Kumarvine is also limited to discussing with children and children.
In this discussions were held on the subjects related to the study of children or their habits for long time .
Whatever they are doing or how they think about it, whether they can learn something new or not, I always try to do it.
At the end, this is a New India.
Some people say that the young generation has a desire to do many things at the same time.
I tell you, what is wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the courage to question and dream of big dreams, the same youth have brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineeta ji has written on MyGov that I should talk about 'Sanvidhan Divas' which will be held tomorrow on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
They say that this is a very special day because we have accepted the Constitution and it has been 69 years since we are going to enter it in the 70th year.
Just imagine, within three years, these great personalities have created such a massive and comprehensive event.
This is a great example of how these great people have worked with such a rapid pace of deciding.
The special thing in our Rajya Sabha is that rights and duties have been described in detail in detail about rights and duties.
In the lives of citizens, both of them will take the country forward.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then we will be protecting our rights automatically. And even if we follow our duties in the Rajya Sabha, we will be protecting our rights.
I still remember Changlach that when India's democracy was 60 years old, in 2010, we had taken an elephant ride in Gujarat with an elephant safari.
We are reminded of our efforts to create awareness among the youth about the development of the state and connect them with the important aspects of the state.
And let us ensure that there is peace, prosperity and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, we can never forget the contribution of a great soul when it is discussed by the Rajya Sabha Committee.
It was a great man, a revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
What is a democracy and what is a parliamentary system, this is not something new for India.
He had said that this freedom that we have achieved after so much struggle is invaluable and we have to protect it to the last drop of our blood.
India First Ha Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv next year in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
All State Governments and Union Territories have also been instructed to celebrate this event in a big way.
In this way, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Guruvadar at that time.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, this guerrilla suffered huge losses.
However, the manner in which the state government has worked with the help of local people, it is going to be an ideal even today.
An important decision has been taken by the Government of India to make the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
However, our journey is going to continue this way.
The more people will be connected with all of us, the more our journey will be better and everyone will be happy.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what can I get from Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, our ladies and gentlemen, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I urge all of you to participate in this drive to listen in large numbers.
Just six months before independence, on 27th January 1947, the world's famous International Monthly Time was published on the page of Sardar Patel.
This was the map of an India that had been divided into several parts.
More than 550 institutions were in the country at that time.
Even if the British juice of India had finished, they used to break this country in many parts and then leave the country.
The Times had written that the threats like suppression, violence, pride, inflation and politics of power are surpassing India.
He further wrote that if anyone has the ability to encircle the country and to fill the wounds, then it will be Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
In this news of ' TIME ' many other aspects of the life of the iron man were opened .
How did he arrange for rescue operations after the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s, how he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha
He brought about merger of all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad or Travancore, we can see a united India today because of the ideological maturity and strategic skills of the royalty of Rajasthan Sardar Patel.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on seeing this nation bound by the bonds of Sun and Mother India.
On 31st October this year, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be even more special: while paying homage to Sardar Patel, we will dedicate the statue of Statue of Unity to the nation.
Built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of the statue is twice as high as the Statue of Liberty of America.
This statue is the tallest effigy in the world.
Every Indian will now feel proud that the world's tallest statue is in India.
Sardar Patel, whoever was with the land, will now increase the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday we have celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the Indian army personnel landed on the land of Kashmir and protected Khore from smugglers.
This historical event is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the great army officer of India, Sam Manikshaw.
In his address, Field Marshal Manikshaw was reminding me of the period of his career.
On 31st October, the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Respectfully paying homage to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
In the world of sports, spirit, strength, skill and stamina all these things are very important.
The youngsters of the country who have these qualities will not only make the country progress in areas like economy, science and technology, but will also flag off the sports.
Our Para Athletes, who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018, had the opportunity to visit.
India won a total of 72 medals in this competition, winning a new record and enhancing Indias honour.
I am fortunate to personally meet all these talented para athletes and congratulate them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that in the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth have achieved the best ever.
In this competition, we won three more medals in mix types besides 13 medals.
You must remember that India's performance in this Asian Games was also very good.
See, for a few minutes, how many times I have used the words as the best, most glorious.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is at a new height every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those fields which have never been thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won the Gold Medal in Athletics for the Country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He is a person with disabilities from birth.
When he was eight years old, he had a legacy.
Then he took eight years to an orphanage.
After abandoning orphanage, he used to drive a lifelong vehicle to clean the DTC bus and serve as a waiter in the roadsides in Delhi.
Today, Narayana is winning a gold medal for India in international competitions.
Moreover, please see Indias excellent performance in sports, India has never won an Olympic medal in Judo or at the Senior level.
But Tababi Devi won the silver medal in the Youth Olympics and made history.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsperson, lives in a village in Manipur.
Their widows are labourers and mothers are working for selling fish.
Many times his family had such a time that he had no money for food.
Even in such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not collapsed.
And he won a medal for the country and showcased history.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stubbornness is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organized the FIFA 17-year-old World Cup in 2017.
The entire world appreciated it for its sporting achievements.
A new record about the number of spectators was started in the FIFA Under Saventin World Cup .
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football competitions in different stadiums of the country and encouraged young sportspersons.
This year, India is fortunate to host a Male Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup is scheduled to be held in November 2018 and will continue till December 16.
Every Indian has an intimacy towards hockey, be it sports or sports or fun.
Indias history in hockey has been written in gold.
Earlier, India had won gold medals in several competitions and once again India has been a world champion.
India has also given hockey many great sportspersons.
When there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without these great sportspersons of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
After that, from Balwinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Glodius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai, Hawk has travelled a long way.
Even today, the sportspersons of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey because of their hard work and dedication.
There is a good opportunity for sports lovers to see thrilling encounters.
He visited Bhubaneswar and encouraged not only Indians but also other associations.
In the meantime along with enjoying sports you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and several world famous and sacred places including Chilka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey Association for this competition and I assure you that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with them for their support.
I also convey my best wishes to all the organizations coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people who are coming forward for social work, they are serving themselves, they are inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, today we are moving ahead with new hopes, new zeal and new dreams.
A few days ago, I had gone to a programme, where a portal has been launched, the name of the self-force society, Mygov and the country's IT and electronic industry have started this portal to encourag our employees to provide them such opportunities by encouraging them to take up social initiatives.
Every Indian will be proud to see the enthusiasm and intimacy that they have for this work.
From IT to Society, we are not ego, we are not aged, we are aroma of the journey from self to the whole world.
Somebody is teaching children, somebody is teaching senior citizens, somebody is engaged in cleanliness, somebody helps the farmers.
A young man himself learnt a wheelchair basketball to help the disabled wheelchair basketball team.
This is the spirit, dedication, this is a swift initiative for a specific task.
Would any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I was looking at the information received from people for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see an entertaining tip of Shri Manish Mohapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on Mygov, Please tell us that in Mann Ki Baat, the customs and traditions of many tribes of India are the best examples of coexistence with nature.
How we need to adopt the tradition of sustainable development in our lives, we need to learn something from them.
Manish ji, I would like to congratulate you all for keeping this topic in mind.
It is a matter that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture, the entire world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our year is not over yet, but we only want to take our inner conscience, our rich history, traditions and especially the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
It has been a part of our tribal culture to continue to co-operate with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal communities of central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship Pimpal and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Vishwanoi community showed us the path of environmental protection.
They are supposed to sacrifice their lives especially for the protection of trees, but they cannot afford to damage a single tree.
Arunachal Pradesh claims to have a relationship with Mishmi tigers.
They also consider them as brothers and sisters.
Tigers are seen as protectors of forests in Nagaland .
People from the heritage communities of Maharashtra consider the tiger as a refugee and bring the tigers immense prosperity for them.
It is a belief among the Coal community in central India that their own destiny is linked to the tiger, if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to be hungry.
In the reproductive season of Gond tribal fish in central India, fishing stops in some parts of the river Ketan.
In southern India, on the Nilgiri plateau, a small bhakta community broke down in remote areas, traditionally their habitations are made of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community is very peaceful and united, but if someone is harming their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were from tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against the British government to protect our wild land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something unique for the society.
This kind of work seems to be difficult but in reality it has a very serious effect in changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer Bhai Gurbachan Singh of Punjab.
He was the son of a common and difficult farmer, Gurbachan Singh ji.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we are going to marry bride's mother Vadla in a simple way.
There is no need to spend too much on top and other things.
We have to celebrate this occasion in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have an integral part.
Nowadays, when it comes to the topic of marriage, it seems that something is going to be a big demand in front of the bride, something that will be difficult for the bride's family.
However, we will be surprised to know that this was a simple farmer who had said that the bond that he had placed before the father of the bride is the true power of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said that we will never burn garlands in our fields.
You can imagine how big social power is there in it.
But we have seen how large his personality is, and we have seen that there are so many families in our society that transform the individual context into social interest.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji has given us such an example.
I have read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near NABH.
Kallar Majra is talking about the fact that instead of burning the cereals, they mix naked in the soil and for that the technology that is to be used is used.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to all those who have been doing their best to keep the environment clean and to the people of Kallar Majra.
You are leading the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle like a true legacy.
Small activism and awareness and positive action play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been stated in our books: Peace: Peace: Interview Peace: Peaceful Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: peace: peace: peace: peace: peace: peace: peace: peace: peace. Peace: Peace: peace.
Settle peace in every part of the world in life, in heart, in me, in you, in every part of the world.
Peace: Peace: Peace. Whenever there is talk of world peace, Indias name and contribution will be reflected in the golden letter.
The 11th November of this year has a special significance for India as the first major battle ended 100 years ago on 11th November.
The event marks the completion of 100 years, that is, a century will be accomplished by the enormous destruction and loss of human beings.
The first major event for India was an important event.
In fact, we did not have to give anything directly to that war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there was a war, it was not less than anyone.
Our soldiers have showered valour in remote areas, in adverse situations.
This was the only objective - the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world witnessed the emergence of all the monarchy.
According to estimates, nearly one crore soldiers and as many civilians lost their lives.
This has given the importance of peace to all the world.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony are not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, we need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of our North-Eastern India is different.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people here are very talented.
Our Northeast India is known for its best work.
Northeast is an area that has made a lot of progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
The awards are conferred on FAOs associated with the United Nations.
You will be happy to know that the award for making the best policy is with Oscars in that field.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing that our Sikkim has won the award by pursuing 51 nominee policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, the end of October.
There is a huge change in the weather.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen on this occasion.
I urge you to take care of yourself, take care of your health and take care of social interest during these festivals.
This festival is an opportunity to take a new decision.
This festival has been decided to move forward in the mission mode and make a solemn pledge in our lives.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The country will progress as much as you can progress.
