My dear countrymen, Namaskar
My best wishes to you all on Diwali
We have been told - Shubham Karoti Kalyan Health Dhansampadam
How excellent is the message in this verse, the light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which shows goodwill by destroying the opposite intellect.
I bow down to such a divine light
What could be a better idea to remember this Deepawali than to expand light, spread positivity and pray to destroy the feeling of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world
The special thing is that not only Indian community is involved in this thing but now governments of many countries, citizens of that place, social organizations of that place celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way , India stands there
Friends, Festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our India, which has Country of Festivals, has immense possibilities of festival tourism.
We should strive to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and also include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
Every state, every region has so many festivals of its own. People from other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that we will do something different on this Diwali.
I had said that let us celebrate the women power and achievements of India on this Diwali, that is, the respect of Lakshmi of India.
And immediately after that, there was a lot of inspirational stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh of Karangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power.
My mother is God for me
Everything is for me and it is India ' s Lakshmi in the true sense .
Ramesh ji, my bow to your mother
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that Major Khushboo Kanwar is Lakshmi of India who is the daughter of Bus Conductor and led the All-Commen detachment of Assam Riles.
For poetry Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi, her daughter, who is also her strength
They are proud that their daughter paints the best
He has also obtained a very good Rank in the ATE examination
Megha Jain ji has written that an elderly 92-year-old woman of Ninety Two Year gives free water to passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji, the humility and compassion of Lakshmi of this India has inspired a lot.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, take inspiration and share the same with yourself and I respectfully bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the eminent poetess of the 17th century Sachi Onnamma, he wrote a poem in the 17th century, in Kannada, in the Kannada language, that word, that word, every Laxmi of India, this is what we are talking about.
It seems as if his Foundation was composed in the 17th century.
How good words, how good expressions and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himavantanu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidanupennida Jankarayanu Jasuvalendanu i.e. Himantaraja, due to her daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu got fame due to her daughter Lakshmi and King Janaka got fame due to her daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and the glory of these daughters is a strong identity of our society and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Devji ' s influence is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visits to the gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you, but for this, many episodes of Mann Ki Baat will take place.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanak Devji believed that there could be no cost for selfless service work .
They stood firmly against social evil like untouchables
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji conveyed his message to the world, far and wide
He was one of the most travelers in his time
They went to many places and wherever they went, they won their hearts with their simplicity, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji performed many important religious pilgrimages, called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they went north or south, east or west, and met people, saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that Sankardev , the famous saint of Assam , was also inspired by him .
He visited the holy land of Haridwar
There is a sacred place in Kashi, Gurubagh Gurudwara, it is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed there
He went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Travel to Guru Nanak Dev ji, Sri Lanka in the South
During the visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji also visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev also went to Tibet, where people, considered him as a guru
They are also revered in Uzbekistan, where they had traveled.
During one of his sadness, he also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arab, III.
Just a few days ago, the ambassadors of the High Five Countries of 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this happened on the occasion of 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these ambassadors not only visited the Golden Temple but also got the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, many Ambassadors shared pictures on the Social Media with great pride and good experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of October 31.
Sardar Patel used to look at numerous things in depth and test them in depth.
In fact, they were Man of Detail
At the same time he was skilled in organizational skills
He had mastered plans and strategy
When they read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they can see how powerful his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921 at Nineteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire system of the session
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping them with you ended the tension of shoes being stolen from the heart of delegates
On the other hand khadi sales also increased considerably .
Our country, Sardar Patel will always be grateful for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did an important job of ensuring fundamental rights, thereby avoiding any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a great job of uniting the princely states and doing a very big job.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in some special provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947 , our neighbour looked at Lakshadweep and sent the ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got this information, he lost time without delay, without delay, immediately, he started to take drastic action.
Soon after their command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and destroyed Lakshadweep by the sight of every neighbour .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar Brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination
I hope you all will visit its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the day when the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
It ' s the tallest statue in the world
Statue of Liberty in the United States is double in height
The tallest statue in the world makes every Indian proud
Every Indian's head rises higher than pride
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the magnificence of Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had expressed his faith and reverence in his heart and now several centres of attraction like Factus Garden, Butterly Garden, Jungle Saari, Hildren Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery are continuously developing and this is also encouraging the local economy and providing new employment opportunities to the people.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villagers are providing home-to-houses and home-to-house facilities.
Professional training is also being provided to people providing Come Stay Facilities.
The people there have started cultivating ragon ruit and I am sure it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witness to the fact that within a year, a place developed as a world famous tourism destination.
There people from all over the country come
Many systems of transport, lodging, guides, eco-friendly arrangements are being developed after one by oneself.
Very large economy is developing and people are generating facilities as per the requirement of passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, from 2014 on 31st October every year, National Unity Day is celebrated.
This day gives us the message of protecting our country at all costs of unity, integrity and security.
On 31st October, every time Run for Unity is also being organized.
It will include people from every section of society, every section of the society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of this, this country is one in one direction and wants to achieve one goal.
One goal - Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat II.
It has been observed in the last five years - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the district centres, in small tier-to-tier-three cities too, there are very large numbers of men, women, people of the city, people of the villages, children, youth, elderly people, people of the country, people of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of the country, people of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of the country, people of the country, people of different parts of the country, people of different parts of the country
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a passion and passion for marathon.
Run for Unity is also a unique provision.
Running is beneficial for all mind - brain and body .
There is also a race for ITDC.
At the same time, we are also connected to this purpose of an India-Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat.
And that is why not just the body, mind and rites to bring India to new heights for the unity of India
And so wherever you live in the city, you can find out about Run for Unity around you
In this portal, information has been given about places across the country where Run for Unity is to be organized.
I hope that all of you will run on October 31 - for the unity of India and for the fitness of yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has built the country in the form of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a ritual in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every turn, at every juncture.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around you, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to enhance mutual harmony, but sometimes it happens that the efforts, contributions and contributions of the society disappear from the memory panel very soon.
Friends, I remember that when the Allahabad High Court pronounced its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi in September 2010
Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of those situations in their own way.
What kind of language was spoken to create warmth in the atmosphere
But it continued for five days, seven days, ten days, but as the decision came, a joyous and surprising change was felt by the country.
Everything had happened for two weeks on one hand but when the decision was taken on the Ram Janmabhoomi then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day , I am happy .
He respected the dignity of the judiciary very gloriously and did not allow any warmth and tension to be created anywhere.
These things should always be remembered , they give us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
I pay my tributes to them today
My dear countrymen, today, if one story of every house is heard far and wide, one story of every village is heard - from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, one story is about cleanliness.
But there is also a pleasant experience and interesting experience .
I heard, I think, I'll tell you, too
You imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature goes minus 50-60 degrees minus
Coygen is also of name in the air
In such adverse situations, living in the midst of such challenges, is not less than any heroism.
In such a deteriorating situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but also running Swachh Siachen campaigns there.
I appreciate the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army .
thank you .
there ' s so cold that it ' s hard to get anything decompose
In such a situation, separation and management of waste is a very important task in itself.
In such a scenario, removing 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surrounding areas and also how big a service is between the ragile eco-system here.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier which is a source of rivers and clean water, so running a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in lower areas.
Also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, specially buying something new, bringing something from the market in a small quantity in every family.
I once said we should try - buy local things
If we get what we need from our village then there is no need to go to Tehsil .
If found in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
The more we try to buy our local items, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in our own right.
And I have been insisting on buying something or the other from the hands of our weavers, our Khadi people.
Even in this Diwali, you might have bought a lot before Diwali but many people also think that if they go after Diwali then they might get a little cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who will still be bought .
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward to buy local items.
See, we can also play an important role in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
We use various firecrackers in Diwali
But, sometimes there is a fire in indifference
Somewhere it becomes injury.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fanfare .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Talk of mind, September 2018
Will he have control over his own life and destiny 
You can remember that Jantar of revered Bapu
Can we imagine while shopping that what I am buying will benefit the citizens of my country
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
Best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious festival
Rakshabandhan ' s festival is considered as a symbol of love and faith between sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country in which a defence formula had linked two different states or religions with the bottom of faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also going to come.
The entire atmosphere is going to echo with the glory of elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda.
The joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Rakshabandhan , Sanskrit day is also celebrated on Shravan Purnima day .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, riding and delivering this great heritage to the common man.
Every language has its own importance, India takes pride in the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians are proud of the fact that from the Vedas to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a very big role in the propagation of knowledge.
Every field of life related knowledge is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technology, whether it is agriculture or health or architecture or architecture or management, whether it is economics or environment, it is said that the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are made possible.
Sometimes they use lion-shayari but those who are acquainted with Sanskrit greetings know that in very few words this accurate statement is made from Sanskrit greetings and it is also very easy to understand because of being connected to our soil, our traditions.
As has been asked to explain the importance of the guru in life - Akshramastu, Guru: disciple Prabodhyat
Let us all celebrate the upcoming Teachers Day with this feeling
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day. I also compliment science, education and your dedication to the students.
Plants scorching from the heat give relief to the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings very rain and devastating floods.
There is a situation of nature that in some places there has been more rain than others .
Floods in Kerala have badly affected people's lives
Today, in these difficult situations, the whole country stands with Kerala
Our feelings are with those families who have lost their lives, the loss of life cannot be compensated. But I want to assure the bereaved families that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
My prayer is that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will go healthy as soon as possible.
I am sure that with the strength and indomitable courage of the people of the state, Kerala will soon rise again.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other at their own level so that wherever there is an objection, be it Kerala or other districts of India or be it areas or be it areas, peoples lives can become normal again.
All the Hage Groups and people associated with every field of work are contributing
Everyone is trying to ensure that the troubles of the people of Kerala can be at least done, let us share their grief.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NRC junkies.
He has done a very good job in this moment of crisis .
Efforts to bring the situation to the fore by their commitment and quick decisions have become a new centre of reverence for every Indian.
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam gives strength to the country, especially to Kerala, so that they can recover from this calamity at the earliest and the development journey of Kerala gets a boost.
Once again, I would like to assure all the citizens of Kerala and other parts of the country where disasters have occurred, that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind
Then the subject on which people from all over the country wrote the most is the subject of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and Mygov and urged me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, as soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for 10 years , he had gone far from active politics .
They were not seen anywhere in the news, they were not seen publicly.
Over the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the fore.
People remember him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act Two Thousand Three
This change made two important changes in India ' s politics
First, the size of the Cabinet in the states was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats
Secondly, the limits fixed under the anti-party law were increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Along with this, clear guidelines were also set for disqualification of party-changers.
For many years, the political culture of constituting a huge cabinet in India was created not only for the sharing of big cabinet but also for the sake of making the politicians happy.
Atal ji changed it
Their move saved money and resources
With this, efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji who changed the situation and healthy traditions flourished in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in the time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 o ' clock in the evening , because at that time there was time for parliament to start in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am
Several rules have been made in this code, making it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Because of this, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag.
Thus they brought Our beloved Tricolor closer to the people .
Likewise, nowadays you are seeing that the discussion about holding the elections of the Center and the states together in the country is going on.
People are keeping their points in both sides of this subject and the opposition
This is good and auspicious sign for democracy
I must say that it will be a great tribute to Atal ji for a healthy democracy, developing good traditions for a better democracy, constantly striving to strengthen democracy, taking forward discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay my homage to Atalji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days back the monsoon session of Parliament has ended .
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha is 74.
Above the Dalits, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and consequently, the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth
Several important Bills that benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, there was a way to create a BC Commission like the SST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, this time the country has fulfilled its resolve to set up a BCC and gave it a constitutional right.
This step will prove to be advancing the objective of social justice .
Amendment Bill to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed in this session
This law will further safeguard the interests of the SC and ST communities
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from torturing and trust in Dalit communities.
No civil society can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country .
The guilty of rape are not ready to tolerate the country, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made the provision of harshest punishment.
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls under the age of 12 years.
You must have read in the newspapers a few days ago a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two convicts of rape to death after just two months of hearing.
Prior to this, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh sentenced the culprits to death after just five days of hearing.
Rajasthan has also made similar quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with full force to bring them justice .
When we move forward in the countryside, changes can be brought about in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
In the monsoon session this time everyone has presented an ideal .
These days the attention of millions of Indians is on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won medals.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country
My best wishes to those sportspersons who are yet to compete.
Indias players are performing excellently in shooting and restoring but our players are also bringing medals in sports in which our performance has not been so good before, such as sports like Lushu and Roving - these are not medals - proof of the zeal and dreams of Indian sports and players
Increased number of medal winners for the country include our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even among the young players who win medals, we are 15-16 years old
There is also a very good indication that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts as well as pay my tributes to Hockey's magician, great sportsperson Shri Dhyan Chand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day
Greetings, I respect your spirit.
All of us have seen houses and buildings built with brick stones, but can you imagine that about twelve-hundred years ago, a huge mountain which was just a single stone mountain, was given the form of an excellent, huge and wonderful temple - it is probably difficult to imagine, but that was the temple - Kailashnath temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra
If someone tells you that a 60 metre long pillar of granite was built about a thousand years ago and a 80 tons of granite rock was placed on its summit - will you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mail of architecture and engineering can be seen
Everybody is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patna , Gujarat .
India's land is a laboratory of engineering
There have been many engineers in India who have imagined the unimaginable and presented examples of miracles in the engineering world.
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose work is still amazing people and they were Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
He is revered in that part of the country and the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In their memory , September 15 is made as Engineers Day .
Following his footprints, our country's engineers have made their own distinct identity all over the world.
When I talk about the miracles of the engineering world, I am reminded of an incident of a terrible earthquake that struck Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
When I used to work there as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village and there I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was ridiculing us by looking at me. And she was saying, Look, this is my house.
But you didn ' t see any damage anywhere
These houses were constructed by our ancestors according to the nature, according to the environment here and he was saying this thing so proudly, so I got the idea that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period did what kind of compositions they had done in accordance with the local conditions due to which the common man was safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Should workshops at the location
What new things have we to learn in the changing age
The world is battling natural disasters
In such a situation what is the new form of structural engineering 
What are her courses
What to teach students 
How did Ero waste make it our priority 
When many such things celebrate Engineers Day, we must think.
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with this preparations for Diwali also start .
We will continue to meet in Mann Ki Baat, we will continue to talk about Mann Ki Baat and we will continue to move ahead with our hearts.
My best wishes to you all with this feeling.
Thank you
meet again .
There are reports of good rainfall in many places these days .
There is news of anxiety due to excessive rainfall somewhere and people are still waiting for rain at some places.
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain shows the form of preference and dislike, but what do we blame rain, man is the one who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and consequently, nature sometimes becomes rough on us
And that is why it becomes our responsibility to be a lover of nature, to be a protector of nature, to be a promoter of nature, to balance between what is given to nature.
Just like in the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shaken the human mind
You must have seen on TV, a team of 12 young football players and their coaches went to the cave in Thailand.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But , on that day , fortune had been different .
When they went inside the cave , suddenly due to heavy rains , a lot of water accumulated near the cave door .
You can imagine how the moment will be when death appears in front of adolescence and you have to spend moments.
On the one hand, while on the other hand, humanity was uniting all over the world and manifesting the humanitarian qualities of God.
People all over the world were praying to take these children out safely
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their families, media or citizens of the country, everyone has shown the wonderful behaviour of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in their mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a Thai Navy naval personnel lost their lives.
The whole world is astonished that he did not give up his hope with such bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water , despite such difficult situations .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things.
We just need to focus on our goal with a calm and stable mind, keep working for it.
In the past, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us behind.
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, confidence in himself
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
Because this is the time when the colors have a peak season .
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges
If you go to Feb and March, Feams, Papers, Hanswars then in April and May holidays, results, decisions taken in the direction of further life, carriage choice is spent in this regard.
July is the month when youngsters step in a new phase of their lives when they move away from focus to cut-off
The attention of the students goes from Home to Hostel
Students come under the shadow of professions from the shadow of parents.
I am sure that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of a college life.
For the first time going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment has to become a chariot of its own.
For the first time so many youngsters leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students must have joined their own colleges so far, some will be joiners.
I would like to tell you people that be calm, enjoy life, enjoy the spirit in life.
There is no fodder without books, no study has to be done, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends, it is a very wise thing in itself.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages
Young people who have left their homes and have gone to some other place outside their homes should discover those places, know about them, know the language, culture, know the tourist places there - go there, know about them.
My best wishes to all the youngsters on starting a new innings
His father raises garbage and raises his family
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students belonging to a poor family and they have done something that inspires us all by their hard work and perseverance despite the opposite conditions.
Bitiya Afreen Shaikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto Rickshaw, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick kiln.
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair or Anushka Panda, the divyang daughter of Gurgaon, who has been suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy, all of them have achieved such a success by crossing every barrier with their determination and enthusiasm.
If we look around, we will find many such examples.
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to call every darkness in the light. I have to smell the sword with the smell of flowers, and to wake up the mountains of Ga-ga. My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news, it was written - Two youths did the dream of Modi
The incident was that once San Jose City of America, known as the Technology Lub, I was discussing with Indian youth.
I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something by taking time out.
I had appealed to convert Brain-rain into Brain-Gain
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly prepared a SmartGaon App using their professional skills.
These apps are not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but they can now get any information and information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of Taudakpur village of Rae Bareli, Village-Pradhan, District Magistrate, all people made people aware about the use of this App.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will be noticed that the youth of America is living in the midst of their lives and thoughts. He must have left India several years ago but still he knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and is emotionally connected to the village.
For this reason, he could probably make something in accordance with what the village needs
Every Indian naturally has a sense of attachment to his village, his roots and of doing something for the country.
But sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distances, sometimes because of ecological conditions, a slight ash gets accumulated on it, but if a small spark gets touched then all things emerge again and they bring it towards their past days.
It has not happened in our case, the conditions, the circumstances, the distances have not separated us, the ashes have not been frozen.
Santosh ji thank you very much for your phone call.
Actually Pandharpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July, is also celebrated as a grand culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy city in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi the pilgrimages i . . pilgrims come out on foot for the journey of Pandharpur with palanquins .
This journey, which is called Vari, includes millions of warkaris
The great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram walk towards Pandharpur while singing, dancing and dancing in a palanquin.
Tirthankaras Lord Vithal , who is also called Vithova or Panduranga , reach there for their viewing .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense reverence and devotion
Going to Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty, spiritual joy has its own unique experience.
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once you get the opportunity.
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating the masses in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstitions and in every corner of India this saint tradition has been inspiring
Whether they are their brothers or sisters, we get important messages of harmony, love and brotherhood from them.
It is a mantra to fight the society with reverence against superstition.
These were the people who from time to time prevented the society, showed a token and a mirror and ensured that the old evil practices were eliminated from our society and people had rites of compassion, equality and purity.
This is our Indo-Bhumi Bahuratna Vasundhara like a great tradition of saints lived in our country, in the same way the great men who dedicated their lives to the powerful mother India, sacrificed their lives to this land.
There are such great men Lokmanya Tilak who have left a deep impression on many Indians
We recall Tilak jis birth anniversary on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence
They had the power and wisdom to show the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they tried to treason him three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I would like to put an interesting event in front of the countrymen associated with a statue of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad today.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad almost a hundred years ago. During his visit here, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 01, 1920, he had decided to build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and it was named Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Ultimately the statue was constructed and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not only to anyone but to Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 1929. And it is a matter of great joy. In that inaugural function, revered Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got one person but it has also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak ji.
My dear countrymen, the uniqueness of this statue is that it is a rare idol of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in which he has written just below Tilak. Swaraj is our birthright.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav started with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium for furthering the spirit of traditional reverence and festivities as well as societal awakening, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
There was a time when it was necessary that the country should be united to fight against the British, these festivals did the work of uniting all by breaking the barriers of caste and creed.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
This shows that even today, our younger generation is crawling towards our heroes of our ancient heritage and history.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street .
This is also a great opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop within themselves.
I had requested last time too and once again when I remember Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate it with pomp and pomp but insist on celebrating Ganesh festival eco-friendly.
From the idol of Ganesh Ji to the decoration of decoration, everything should be eco-friendly. And I would like that every city should have different competitions of eco-friendly Ganesh festival, they should be rewarded. And I would like to keep things on MyGov as well as on Narendra Modi App for publicity.
I will surely convey your message to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen. He gave a slogan Swaraj is our birthright and we will remain with us.
Today it is time to say that Swaraj is our birthright and we will take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development results
I ' m talking about Chandrasekhar Azad
Who will be such a young man in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our hearts, it is in our hearts to see how strong the power is in the hands of the people. These lines inspired many youngsters like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azad's passion for the bravery and freedom, it inspired many youth
Azad put his life on the claim, but he never bowed before foreign rule
It was my privilege to visit Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also had the opportunity to pay homage to him and Chandrashekhar Azad Ji was a brave man who did not want to die from the bullets of foreigners - if he lived, he would fight for freedom and die, he would continue to die freely.
Once again I respectfully bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has made history by winning the gold medal in the 400m race at the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Inland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, in response to my letter, emailed me from Indonesia and is currently preparing for Asian Games.
Unity in Mail writes, The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I have done that.
Unity we all are proud of you
You have illuminated the country ' s name
Unity has won Gold and Bronze Medals in World Para Athletics Grand Pri 2018 in Tunisia
His achievement is special because he made his challenge the medium of his success .
In 2003, due to road accident, half of her body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and gained this position by strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has won gold medal in discus throw at Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin, along with Sundar Singh Gurjar also won gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, in the month of August, many events of history are full of festivals, but sometimes the disease also enters the house due to the weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the good health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for the centuries-long celebrations.
And verily , we shall meet for a word of the mind .
Hello
My dear countrymen, once again in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to be with you all.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have understood very well that I am talking about the Test match between India and Afghanistan
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
Both the teams performed well in this match and Rashid Khan, a baller from Afghanistan, did this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani tagged me on his twitter. The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
It is the asset of the world of cricket and at the same time he wrote in a little bit of funny style, we are not going to give it to anybody.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us
Well , this was the first match , so it ' s very natural to remember , but I ' ll remember this match for a particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can an Indian team do while taking the trophy What they did
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team of Afghanistan, which was playing international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and both the teams took photos together.
What is sportsman spirit, what is sportsmanship - we can experience from this one incident.
Sports is an unprecedented method of uniting society and discovering the talent of our youth.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June had a different view on the 4th Yoga Day.
The whole world was united
Be it the European Parliament in Bresil, the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, the Japanese navy fighter ships, people from all over the world come to see Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic programme of yoga and I was told that women had demonstrated a lot of postures.
Indian and Chinese troops jointly perform yoga on Ladakh's high snowy peaks
Yoga breaks all boundaries, connects
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a great festival by going beyond all forms of caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world were so enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why would not the enthusiasm in India be multiplied
Our Air Force fighters stunned everyone by performing Yogasana at an altitude of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky.
The sight was that they did floating in the air, not sitting in the airplane.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere
Yoga has worked beyond caste, creed and geography to unite people all over the world. We have won the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam for centuries.
Our sages, sages, saints who always insist on, Yoga has proved it in true sense.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives
On MyGov and NarendraModiApp, many people have written to me that I will talk about the Coctors Day on 1st July - the right thing is
We are those people who naturally worship Mother as God, believe in God as mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, so many times the doctor gives us rebirth.
The role of a doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor does not have medical expertise, but he has a deep experience about the general life style trends, its impact on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills
Master in medical profession, along with hardworking, our doctor is known for solving complex medical problems.
We are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historical event has happened.
Look, everywhere in India has its own legacy.
There is a saint, a great man, a well-known person, everyone has his own contribution, his greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and anyway when I was in Gujarat, you are well aware of Gujarat's Kabirvad.
When I used to work there, I had also organized a national convention of people associated with the tradition of Saint Kabir.
You know, why did Kabirdas ji go to Maghar
At that time there was an impression that one who dies in Maghar does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that leaves in Kashi goes to heaven
Maghar was considered unholy but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
They used to break the evils and superstitions of their time , so they forgot , and they took the samadhi .
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his stories and duals.
That was their ideal
In his works we see the same ideal and in today ' s era they are equally inspiring .
The true saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the grief of another, they are ruthless
Kabirdas ji stressed on social harmony .
They thought far ahead of their time .
Put it here, pity all coy
In another couplet, Kabir writes - where there is mercy teh religion, where greed and sin
He said: - Do not ask the caste sadhu, ask the knowledge
This is the greatness of the guru and such a guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed the way to millions of people, keep inspiring for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
wherever he went , he took several initiatives for the betterment of society .
The arrangement of a kitchen free from social discrimination, where every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and zeal
I urge you all to think about the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, how to celebrate it in the entire society and around the world, new ideas, new suggestions, new ideas, new imaginations, we should make preparations and with great pride we should make this Prakash Parv an inspiration.
My dear countrymen
India's freedom struggle is very long, very wide, deep and full of countless martyrdom.
There is another history related to Punjab
100 years of the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which had shamed the entire humanity.
We can all think about how the 100 years of this event is going to be completed, but we should always remember the immortal message that this incident has given us. These violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini of Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6 is the birthday of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would be aware that on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed Convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
This was the first time that the British ruled and someone at the University of Kolkata had addressed the convocation in Bengali.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Minister of Industry of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation stone for Indias industrial development.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was to be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop large industries as well as pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
They were quite passionate about the development of West Bengal.
The result of their understanding, discretion and activism is that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this he lost his life at the young age of 52.
Let us always remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, with the spirit of goodwill for Indias progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
I got the opportunity to know directly about the changes in the lives of people by going beyond the files.
People talked about their resolve, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me, but it was a different learning experience and what could be the moment of satisfaction in anybody's life due to the happiness that people had seen during this period
When he listened to the stories of a common man, his narrative of his experience touched his heart.
In far-flung villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to passports to the elderly people of villages through Common Service Centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by creating an ice-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of youngsters of the country are running medicine centres as well as providing cheap medicines by visiting nearby villages.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two-three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, it is giving more jobs to ten to fifteen people
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school tinkering lab at a young age.
No one knows how many stories there was no corner of the country where people did not want to talk about their success.
In such an environment, when the common man comes with new hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, he is not credited with the government.
The incident of a small girl from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology for me, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant, inspiring and it gives me the satisfaction of working but it also gets the enthusiasm to do more.
Another new enjoyment, another new enthusiasm, another new inspiration for the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and gave me a new strength.
I want to thank you all once again .
I always feel that if we look around, something good happens somewhere or the other.
Good people are .
We can also experience the aroma of goodness
One thing I noticed in the past and this is a very unique combination
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming and farming.
They came together with the Technicians to build a simple prosperity trust and they activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
They joined the farmers, made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
The farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop products to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of farmers in profits.
Separate seed bank has been created for the crop to be good, good breed seeds for it.
Women see the functioning of this seed bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters from the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their scope to join the farmers, connect with the villages, connect with the fields and barns.
Once again I would like to congratulate the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments, whatever I might have to go, whatever I might have to go, some might have known, some might not have known, but several people are continuously doing something or the other.
GST is going to be completed one year. The dream of the people of the country, the dream of One Nation, One Tax has changed into a reality today.
I would like to give credit to the states if I want to give credit to anyone for the One Nation One Tax reform.
There is a great example of GST Cooperative Federalism, where all the states together took a decision in the interest of the country and after that such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all take pride that people of different political ideology sit there, people from different states sit there, people from different states have different priorities but despite this, all the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been done with consensus.
There used to be 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of honesty
Earlier, there used to be complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of taxes a lot in the country.
Everything from return to reund is done through online information technology.
With the introduction of GST check posts have been eliminated and the movement of goods has accelerated, which is not only saving time but also gaining a lot in the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform
Such a huge tax reform was achieved in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured through manpower.
It is generally believed that such a large country, such a large population takes 5-7 years to stabilize it completely. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the honesty of the country, the celebration of the country's integrity, the participation of the people of the country is a result of the fact that within a year these new tax systems have become their place, they have achieved stability and they continue to improve with their inbuilt system as per the requirement.
Through Mann Ki Baat, once again you have got the opportunity to be the most compassionate
You will remember very well that six women commanders of the navy, one team has been on a sea trip for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - I want to talk about them
These 6 daughters of India, their team has taken over two centres and it our days - more than 250 days through the sea.
NSC has returned to India on May 21 after touring the whole world in Tarini and the whole country welcomed him very warmly.
They traveled in different oceans and many seas and covered a distance of about twenty thousand nautical miles
It was the first incident in the world itself
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, for enhancing the reputation of Navy, for enhancing the dignity of India and especially the world that the daughters of India are not less - I congratulate them for delivering this message.
Who does not know the Sense of Adventure
If we look at the developmental journey of mankind, progress has been made only in the womb of some adventure.
Development takes birth only in the lap of adventure
The intention to do something, to do away with some leaks, to do some extra ordinary things, I can do something, these feelings may be less, but for ages, crores of people get inspiration.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Tribal Students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a group of our tribal children climbed the highest peak in the world.
These Ashram-School students started training in August 2017 - Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were trained
These youths were selected under the mission valour and they have made the country proud by winning the verest in accordance with the name.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur, my young friends and heartiest greetings to them.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to conquer verest on behalf of Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia became the first pair of the first Indian father-son to climb the verest
Not that only young people are climbing the verest
Sangeeta Bahl climbed the verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Behl's age is more than 50
This work is not only commendable, but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness, towards the environment.
For years people have been climbing the verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartiest greetings to all these brave heroes, especially daughters of the country.
So a large number of people from every field will come forward in its support
When I talk about It India, I believe that the more we play, the more we play, the more the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing the videos of Fitness Challenge, they are challenging each other in it.
Many times in the matter of mind, in relation to the games, in relation to the players, you have heard some things from me and the last time our hero of the Commonwealth Games, the talk of his mind, through this program were telling us - Namaskar sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the sports that were once a part of the life of every child, they are becoming less and less today.
These games were specially part of the summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that they were known by different names at different places, just as Pittu is now known by many names.
No one knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Dikori, Satodia
There are two types of games in traditional games
There are out doors, there are also indoors
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names at different places
I am from Gujarat, I know that there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal Isto
This is played with codes or tamarind seeds or dice and with square board of 88
This game was played in almost every state
We used to play these games
Who will be of us, who has not played gill-danda in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played from village to city
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Fininindalu
Some games have their own season
You must have seen many children who are of shy nature but are very cheerful while playing
When grandparents, grandparents and grandparents play all these things then what they say is not generation gap, they also become untouched.
At the same time, we also know our culture and traditions
Many games also make us aware about society, environment etc.
By crowd sourcing we can make a big archive of our traditional games
Videos of these games can be created, in which rules of sports can be shown about how to play
On June 5, India will officially host World Environment Day
This is a very important achievement for India and it is a reflection of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time theme is Beat plastic pollution
I appeal to all of you, to understand the importance of this theme, to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on wild life and on our health.
Go to the website of World Environment Day weed-india 2018 and there are many suggestions given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them into your everyday life.
In the last few weeks, we have seen that in different parts of the country there has been dust and lightning and heavy rains, which is unseasonal.
There was also loss of life and property
We have to live in harmony with nature, live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this for every step throughout his life
When India played a key role in the Op21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, it was at the core of all this that Mahatma Gandhi had a sense of fulfilling that dream.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what we can do to make our planet clean and green.
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You always remember on June 21, not only you, but the whole world remembers on June 21.
21st June is observed as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparing months ago.
The news is being received these days, preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
Centuries ago, this thing has been said straightforwardly that on regular practice of yoga some good qualities become like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage that always protects us like a father .
A feeling of forgiveness arises as a mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our lasting friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our child, mercy, our sister, self-consciousness, our brother, the earth itself, our bed and knowledge becomes our hunger-free.
When so many qualities become a companion then the Yogi overcomes all kinds of fears .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their legacy of yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the death anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of India
I salute Panditji
The memory of this month is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers stood up against injustice, showing their bravery.
Sadly , for a very long time , we have been calling the events of 1857 merely rebellion or military revolt .
In fact , the incident was not only brought down but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month in which the first freedom struggle started.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of characteristics
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a bold revolutionary.
I was watching a story on T.V. of our poor daughters from the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who had been forced from garbage to house-to-house, today they are sewing clothes to cover the poor by learning the work of sewing.
The daughters here, apart from the clothes of themselves and their family, are stitching from normal to good clothes
They are also coursing skill development along with it.
Our daughters have become self-reliant today, they are living their lives with respect and have become a force for their families.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and confidence for their bright future.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something and if you are committed to it then success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties and this is not just about Sikar but you will get to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighborhood, you will be able to see how people lose their problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people.
These discussions are political, social, cinema, sports and sportspersons, and also on the problems of the country - this is a problem - this must be solved - but often these things are confined to discussions, but there are some people who move forward with their actions, with their hard work and passion, make them a reality.
D. Prakash Rao, living in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, has a similar story of making others dreams their own and consuming themselves to fulfill them.
Yesterday I got the privilege of meeting D. Prakash Rao
D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and for giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have abolished the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the whole country.
Let ' s go ahead with positiveness
In the month of June , there is so much heat that people wait for rain and look at the clouds in the sky .
A few days from now people will also wait for the moon
The moon appears to mean that Eid can be celebrated .
After one month ' s fast during Ramzan , the festival of Eid marks the beginning of celebration .
I am sure that all people will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm. Children will get specially good Idi on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society .
Best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Then we will meet next month in the matter of mind
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
Join it India, lead it India and I am very happy that people are joining it with great enthusiasm. Many people have written to me showing their support for it, have sent letters, have shared their fitness mantra on social media, it is India stories. A gentleman Mr. Shashikant Bhonsale has written sharing a picture of swimming pool - My weapon is my body, my element is water, My world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes, "From the morning walk, I feel myself happy and healthy and she further says - for me fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy."
Make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience, my dear countrymen
When we hear that in the future there will be wars about water in the world , everyone speaks of this , but do we have any responsibility 
Do we not think that water conservation should be social responsibility
I don't know the Bengali language, but when I was young, I was used to getting up very early - since childhood and in eastern India the radio starts very early, if it starts late in western India then I have a very fat idea in the morning.
Rabindra Sangeet started at 30 o'clock, I didn't know the language that was the habit of listening to Rabindra music early in the morning. And when Anandaloke and Aguner, Poroshmoni got the opportunity to listen to these poems, the mind got a lot of consciousness. You too, Rabindra Sangeet, his poems must have influenced him. I pay my homage to Rabindranath Tagore.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of trying to follow the path of Lord Buddha while remembering Lord Buddha, to resolve and to walk on his path. Lord Buddha is the power of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Ambedkar insists that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy. He had said that My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavmi
My best wishes to the countrymen on this holy festival of Ram Navami
We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life .
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries from ASEAN countries were present here, they had come with them with ultra-troop. And it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting the Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing the same inspiration and influence not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this part of the world.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time I have received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large quantities.
Soft Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting Sanskrit on-line courses.
Besides being a IT professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to reach out to you about the efforts being made on this side .
I would also request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit to consider how to carry forward the suggestions of Kamal ji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar Ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar read comments on your NarendraModiApp
The concern you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is definitely very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresh ji, he says that this time I will talk to the youth about their health.
They think that our young people are physically weak if they compare the Asian Countries
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail.
In the past, the President of France had visited Kashi. His Excellency Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that visit were touching the mind, they were going to create an impact.
And, he had requested that all the photographs, all the videos, should be publicized on social media.
Prashant ji, the Indian government had shared those photos on social media and Narendra ModiApp on that day.
Anagha, Jayesh, I want to tell all of you that your letters make me feel tired all day long.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, whatever I have heard and many of these things have touched my mind. Even if I talk about them only then perhaps for months I will have to continue to say something or the other.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about eam
Holidays have shared your plan,
Worried about the water of animals and birds in the summer
Farmer brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities related to farmers and farming across the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions about water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed in the festival season.
That is, the things of mind change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our mind change the weather in somebody's life.
And why not change 
It has the power to change the weather all over the country .
13 years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of Saidul Laskar of Kolkata died - she decided to build a hospital so that no poor person dies due to lack of treatment.
In his mission, Saidul sold home ornaments and collected money through donations.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of funds, the Bhagirath effort that Saidul Laskar had made was painted and today due to his hard work, due to his determination, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section of the country, this belief has awakened that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward
There is a positive atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hope and hope
This self-confidence, this positivity will realise our resolve of a New India, it will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common man's life.
This feeling is reflected in this line of soil, farm and farm and farmer's attachment to Mahatma Gandhi. If we forget to take care of the soil, then it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri used to often emphasize the need for conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness for better income, better irrigation facilities and ensuring all of them and increasing food and milk production.
This low-sector state has done a great job.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production during 2015-16 compared to last five years.
They have shown that when the goal is set, the courage is high and there is a resolve in the mind then it can be proved and shown by doing it.
In the letters I received, I was seeing that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget a big decision has been taken to provide fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Attempts are being made to connect the local mandis of the village, the Holesale Market and the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce - for this, 22 thousand rural haats of the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platforms while upgrading with the necessary infrastructure.
That is, in a way, this kind of connectivity is being made with any market in the country from the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How did the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our resolve but also how can 1. 25 billion Indians pay the best tribute to Gandhi Ji by joining hands and shoulders
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
What is slogan or mantra or Ghosh-speak
Please give your suggestions about this
Together we have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him to take our country to new heights.
Tell us something about how they are mobilising institutions. Thank you, you have said right and I believe that both Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has gone beyond the conventional approach in the field of health.
All the health related work in the country where the responsibility of health ministry was only there, now all the departments and ministries be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or the state governments are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on preventive health as well as affordable health.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive healthcare, the more the individual, the family and the society will benefit.
Life is the first requirement for being healthy - cleanliness
Yoga has emerged as a preventive healthcare worldwide.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness
This is the result of our commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This time International Yoga Day is less than 100 days left between 21st June
On the last three International Yoga Days, everywhere in the country and the world, people participated in it with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all, for Yoga now.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share this video with all of you so that we can practice asana, pranayama together.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to ensure healthcare accessible and affordable for the common man.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at affordable prices.
More new centers are being opened
I appeal to the audience of Mann Ki Baat to provide information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy - their expense of a lot of medicines will be reduced
They will have a great service .
Heart stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore households i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
Target to make the country TB free by 2025
This is a very big job
You need help in awakening the masses
We all have to make collective efforts to get rid of TB
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had spoken of industrialization of India.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the world's largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has emerged.
The whole world is looking at India as a FB for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible only in the cities due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar relied on urbanization and urbanization of India.
Moving ahead with this vision, smart cities missions and urban missions were started in the country so that all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads, water system, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
They did not want a soul to live in poverty forever .
At the same time , they believed that nothing could be removed from the distribution of the poor .
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s, when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar had talked about ports and waterways.
It was Dr. Baba Saheb who saw Jal Shakti as a nation-power
Today, historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country
New ports are being built on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions took place about 2nd World War, emerging old-ar and partition. At that time, Dr.
He laid the foundation of India's spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working closely with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance. And most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me who are associated with the backward classes.
They have shown us that it is not necessary to be born in a big or wealthy family to move forward, but those born in poor families in India can also dream of, try to fulfill those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people made fun of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan being organized from 14th April to 5th May to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar
Under this, there will be separate programmes on Gram-Development, Poor-Welcome and Social Justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days, several festivals are going to be held in Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance
The life of the messenger of non-violence Lord Mahavir ji, the vision will inspire us all
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of Easter comes, the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ are remembered, who have always given the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion to humanity.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, the same day, the twins and satuvins in Bihar, the Bihu in Assam, the joy and glee of Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will be shadowed.
Through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts that we have received in the form of yield through these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Today, at the beginning, the talk of mind starts with a phone call.
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water .
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, why the water becomes colorful
The same question came in the mind of a young man in the 1920s
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk of science, first of all, the name of India-Ratna Sir CV Raman comes to us.
One of their dinners is known as Raman Heekt
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had hosted the event of light scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta. On the other hand, Sushruta and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are Indias pride
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, Hamous Particle Boson was also named.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles happening in the field of science.
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart with self learning.
Can farmers help with crop production 
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad for the inauguration of the ICD Reate.
Science and Technology are value neutral
They don't have values, themselves
Any machine will do the same thing as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison , who invented Wight Bulb , failed many times in his experiments
Once he was asked about this, he replied that I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making a White Bulb, that is, Dison has made its own failures strong.
Incidentally, I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arabic today.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of his life.
Answer searched and guided humanity
The spirit of asking questions repeatedly to know the truth is important
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific dinner
You should not sit in peace until you get answers to questions like why, what and how
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of Crisis, there are many messages to me about safety and disaster, people keep writing to me something or the other.
Shri Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on Coccupational Safety in his comment on NarendraModi Mobile App.
He has written that safety standards are not so good on factories and construction sites in our country.
If India is National Safety Day on March 4, then the Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness about safety increases among the people.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, we are not able to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
All of us read the board written on the roads several times, it says that vigilance has diminished, forgetting one thing, smiles, smiles and smiles - leave the world so soon, don't join the relationship with security - no fun, otherwise it will be affordable that the sentence is never used in our life.
If we are cautious, if we follow the necessary rules, we can safeguard our lives, but we can also protect our society from major accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of formulas are written about safety on the work place but when we look at it, we don't see its observance.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters, such as chemical and industrial accidents.
Initiatives like Disaster Friends have also been taken to train volunteers in floods and cyclone-affected districts.
Training and awareness have a very important role
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year from the Lou Heat wave.
After this, NMA organised workshops for the management of Heat Wave, campaigned to create awareness among the people.
A good result came out with everyone's participation
Number of deaths due to Lu declined unexpectedly to around 220 in 2017
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
I would like to compliment all those who work in this way, be it innumerable people, social organisations, conscious citizens, who are engaged in relief and rescue operations within minutes of disasters anywhere.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of values of safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives
I mean , what was the arrangement for information 
Why 
Because we are not naturally conscious and therefore we listen after sitting in our ears and aeroplanes but none of us thinks that this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every sphere of life
Let us not imagine that safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the spirit of safety of the society is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time the budget emphasized on making waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas for villages under Swachh Bharat.
Initiatives were initiated and named GBAR-Chan - Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Chan scheme is to clean the villages and generate wealth and energy from them by converting solid waste from animal dung and farm waste to MPST and BI-GAS.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other organic waste to produce energy , but in India its full potential was not being used .
Under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural, we are now moving in this direction.
Cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, all these have been set to be used for making biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to look at dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-reliance in terms of energy for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing income
New job opportunities will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be created for the smooth functioning of the Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self-help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement of Clean Energy and Green jobs. Initiate in the direction of converting waste into wealth in your village and making dung from cow dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been listening to a variety of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.
But in a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first waste festival of the state was organized.
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and creating awareness about various ways to re-use the city's waste.
During this festival, there was a variety of activity in which everyone from students to adults participated.
Different types of artefacts were made using waste .
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of the East Management
Inspired by Raipur, different types of garbage festivals took place in other districts too.
Everyone initiated their own initiatives and shared their innovative ideas, discussions and poems on cleanliness.
A festive atmosphere was created about cleanliness.
Especially the way schoolchildren took part in it, it was amazing
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year
There are many programmes in the country and the world
On this day, women are also honored with the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country who have done exemplary work in different areas in the past.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda
He had said that the idea of perfect womenhood is perfect independence - this idea of Swami ji a hundred and fifty years ago expresses the thought of women power in Indian culture.
It is our duty to ensure equality of women in every sphere of social and economic life. It is our responsibility.
We are part of that tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son
They have advanced themselves, they have also carried the country and society forward and taken them to a new place.
In the past , a very good suggestion was given to me by a gentleman
He had suggested that on 8th March there are programmes like celebrating Women's Day. Have they completed 100 years in every village-city
Can a program of respect for such mothers and sisters be organized and a long life can be talked about in it
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that will effectively transform the cleanliness drive in normal life into the habit of the masses.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You all know very well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being a big tourist destination in Mumbai, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, the darkness of the life of the people of three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar, is now dark sixth and their life has become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am glad that now the Elephanta village and Elephanta caves will be lighted by electricity
This is not just electricity, but it is a new beginning of the era of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness better than the life of the countrymen should be illuminated, happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We just celebrated the Shivratri festival.
Now the month of March is the decoration of the fields decorated with fluttering crops, golden earrings of ornamented wheat and the decoration of the mango mango that smokes the mind - this is the unique feature of this month.
But this month is also very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of Holi is as important as Holika combustion , because this day is the day to burn evils in the fire and destroy them .
Holi is an auspicious opportunity to forget all the hearts and minds and to participate in each others happiness and happiness and love gives a message of unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of the festival of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter to Shri Prakash Tripathi on NarendraModiApp and have urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, the date of the virtue of Kalpana Chawla going to the space on February 1
She left us in the Columbia spacecraft accident but inspired millions of young people around the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started the farewell of Kalpana Chawla in his long letter.
It is sad for all of us that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age, but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially India, that there is no limit to women power.
It is not impossible if there is a desire and determination, if there is a responsibility to do something
It is heartening to see that today women in India are moving fast in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place and their contribution in society has surprised the whole world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian scholars
Many of India's scholars have contributed to the building of the Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know many names
This shows the importance of women in our society
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, in the form of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given several further examples
He has written that our bold defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft will fly in Sukhoi 30, inspire them
Three brave women have been trained in Sant Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi fighter pilots and in Sukhoi-30.
Capacity Vajpayee-led All Women Rue has moved from Delhi to San Francisco and back to Delhi by Air India.
India Boeing flew to Jet - and all the women
Honble President of India has taken a new initiative in the past
The President met a group of extraordinary women who had done something first in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, First Demale Merchant Navy aptain, first woman train driver of Passenger train, first woman fire fighter, first woman Bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to reach Everest, thus, first women administrators in every field have achieved extraordinary achievements breaking the orthodoxy of society, established a record
He showed that a new path can be created by crossing all obstacles and obstacles through hard work, perseverance and determination.
A book on these women achievements, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can get inspired by the knowledge, life and work of these women powers.
It is also available as e-book on NarendraModi website.
Today, women power of the country plays an important role in the positive change in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you must be wondering what is the connection between this.
Mumbai's Matunga station is the first station in India where all women employees are
In all the departments women sta - be it Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Hecking, Announcing, Point Person, more than 40 women have a stature.
This time many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social media after watching the Republic Day parade that one of the main points of the parade was the BSF Biker Contingent in which all women were participating.
He was using courageous experiments and this scene was also surprised by the guests coming from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today, our women power is leading
Being self-reliant
When the tribal women come to mind, a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are jungles, footpaths, women carrying the burden of wood on them.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such dangerous areas by running a rickshaw.
In a very short period , many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave what is out of time, accept the correction of what is necessary
Any life-society is identified for its self-reacting mechanism.
Over the centuries against social evils and evils, our country has been continuously striving at the individual and social level.
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13,000 kilometers has been created.
This campaign made people aware about the evils of child marriage and dowry.
The entire state resolved to fight against evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters were all involved in this war.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain went unbreakable to the borders of the State
It is important that our society is free from these evils so that all the people of the society can truly benefit from development.
Let us collectively take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and take a new dimension.
Make India a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain that he has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from MyGov, Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov that his father used to spend six thousand rupees a month on medicines.
He did not know about the first Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in a programme of mind so that more and more people can know about it and take advantage of it .
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about this.
gets a deep satisfaction
And I was also very pleased to know that Shriman Darshan ji had the idea that he had got the idea that he would meet others too.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care affordable and encourage Case of Living
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 90 from branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the masses, especially the senior citizens who take medicines every day, a lot of saving.
Generic medicines purchased are according to the standard of World Health Organisation .
That ' s why good quality medicines get cheaper
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country today
This is not only providing affordable medicines but also generating new employment opportunities for Industrial Enterprises.
Affordable medicines are available at Amrit stores of Indian Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only purpose behind all this is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra shared a Photo on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That Photo was such that my attention was drawn to that Photo
The photo was such that a grandson was taking part in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a cleanliness drive to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river flows for twelve months first but now it's seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, jalkumbh
A lot of waste was being thrown at the river and its banks .
A action plan was prepared and on 13th January a day before the Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna, two edges of the river Morna were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of four kilometers.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this noble work of Mission Lean Morna.
This cleanliness campaign was continued in the same way on 20th January, 2018 and I have been told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning unless the Morana river is completely cleaned.
It shows that there is nothing impossible if a person decides to do something .
Major changes can be brought about through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the district and city corporations for making this work a mass movement. I congratulate all the citizens and your efforts and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about Padma Awards these days.
Even in the newspapers, it attracts attention even on TV.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma Awards but its entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has come due to the entire process being online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been fully transformed.
Padma Awards have been given to such people who are not usually seen in big cities, newspapers, TV festivals.
Now there is no identity of the person to give the award, the importance of his work is increasing
You must have heard that Sriman Arvind Gupta ji will be happy to know about it.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life making toys for children.
They have been making waste toys for four decades to increase the curiosity of science among children
They are trying to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, so they are inspiring children by showing films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
Similar story is Sitawa Joddi (SI) of Karnataka.
They have not been called the goddess of women-empowerment
For the last three decades , in Belagavi , he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself as Devdasi at the age of seven but then spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis .
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for living but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji who illuminated Indias name abroad was recognized and awarded Padma Shri awards
You will be happy to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in tribal areas between dense forests.
He created five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory
They have expertise in manufacturing medicines used after snake bite .
Lakshmi Ji is constantly serving the society with her knowledge of herbal medicines
He was awarded Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by recognizing this anonymous personality.
I would like to mention another name today. 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also chosen for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital
When she was 23 years old, her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard worked hospital.
I am confident that our Bahuratna-Vasundhara has many such males, there are many women whom no one knows, no one knows or knows.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium for the society but I would also like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who have been living around us for the society, those who have been consuming for the society, those who have been working with some specialty and those who have been working throughout their lives.
They do not work for dignity but their work inspires us
Sometimes people in schools and colleges should call upon and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some effort in society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
This is 9th January, when the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARI A
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a program where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living around the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Diji, Tania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, there are many other countries where our mayors are original Indians, where MPs are original Indians, all of them had participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries, but also maintaining strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union, has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe in a better way.
Someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody brings the minds of the society through his music, somebody from his poems.
Someone is doing research on climate change and somebody is working on Indian texts. Someone has set up a gurudwara by running a truck and someone has constructed a mosque.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for giving information to people around the world through them.
On 30th January, there is the death anniversary of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path.
On that day we celebrate martyrdom day, on that day we pay tributes at 11 o'clock to the great martyrs who laid down their lives in the defense of the country.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether it is India or the world, be it individuals or families or the ideals that Bapu lived with, the words that Bapu had told us are still extremely relevant.
They weren't just the core theory
At present, we see on Dagar-Dagar how right Bapu's things were
If we resolve to follow the path of Bapu - as much as possible, what can be a bigger tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude by conveying my best wishes to all of you in 2018.
Where the youth of 18 to 25 years of age should churn on a New India by meeting together, find ways and plans
How can we prove our resolutions before 2022 
How can we build an India which was dreamt of by our freedom fighters 
B.
a.
I talked to them, there was no mention of despair, there was enthusiasm, energy, dreams, I had resolved that the time I spent with those daughters, I also got inspiration and these are the strengths of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country. My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of the famous religious places of the world then it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
And especially at that place which is situated between hills and forests but how can this problem be transformed into a sacrament, how can we find a way to overcome the problem and what is the strength in public participation - this is an example of Sabarimala temple in itself.
Who will make such rules
Hardly, there will be a citizen of India who does not respect them, does not respect them.
At that age we are bigger than all of us, and at different stages of the country, they are witnesses.
She is getting 90 years old on September 28
Before leaving for a foreign trip, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was similar, like, in a very long time, younger brother, he talks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I thought, Hilata ji: Hamodi ji: Many good wishes to you on birthday, let me congratulate
Lata ji: There are a lot of people bigger than age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of someone who is bigger than his work.
Lata ji: Yes, I think that my parents have blessings, and the blessings of those who listen.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is your humility, this is a great education for all of us, it is a very big inspiration for us that despite all these things in your life you have always given priority to the values and humility of your parents.
Lata ji: ji
Modi ji: And whenever I come to you ji: G Modi ji: You have fed me some or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: What are you, you do not know yourself
I know that your visit is changing the picture of India and that is what I am very happy to be.
That sounds very good
Modi ji: Just keep your blessings, keep your blessings on the whole country, and people like us should do something good, you have always inspired me.
I also get your letter and if I get some of your gifts then I have a special pleasure in your adoption, which is a family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to hurt you too much, because, I'm seeing, I know how busy you are and how much you work.
What do you have to think
When you came to see your mother touching her feet, I also sent someone to see her and took her blessings.
Modi ji: yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And she blessed me on the telephone, so I was very happy Modi ji: Our mother was very happy because of your love.
And once again I convey my best wishes to you on birthday.
Modi ji: When Mumbai came this time, he used to think that Rubru would come to Julata ji: ji, ji
Lata ji: Yes, surely, surely
Indeed , it is my good fortune .
Modi ji: Pranam, sister
Lata ji: Pranam
Modi ji: My best wishes to you: Very salute
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Further, for several weeks, across the country, there will be a thrill of festivals
All the best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
In festivals, all family members will come together
Perhaps, these sayings are not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration
Just imagine, on the one hand, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, on the other hand, in front of it, around some people have a dark shadow.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children crave sweets.
The real pleasure of these festivals is only when the darkness is sixth, the darkness is less - light spreads
We share happiness, where there is lack, and this is also our nature.
Think about a moment, a delivery out of our houses, of sweets, of clothing, of gits, when delivery is in.
At least in our homes, the excess of which we do not take into account, we must deliberately out of such things.
In many cities, start-ups of many NGOs young friends do this thing.
They collect clothes, sweets, food, everything from the houses of the people, they bring the needy, they bring them to them and do anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate darkness under this lamp
Your smiles on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness, your face will shine, your gifts will be lighted, your Diwali will become light.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, in the form of good fortune and prosperity, Lakshmi's house arrives.
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi, because daughter brings good fortune and prosperity
Can we do this program of honoring this Lakshmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many of them who will be doing extraordinary work.
Someone will be working for the education of poor children. Someone will be involved in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health. Someone will be serving the society as a doctor, engineer.
By becoming a lawyer, you must try to get justice for someone.
Our society should identify such daughters, respect them and take pride in them.
Their respect programs, be across the country
One more thing that can be done about the achievements of these daughters, share more and more in social media, and use bharatkilami (laxmi of India)
Just like we all had organized a grand campaign, Selfie with Daughter and it had spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, let us run the campaign, Lakshmi of India
Promotion of India's Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, I had said about Mann Ki Baat earlier too. It is a great advantage that I get the good fortune of communicating directly and indirectly with many unknown people.
In the past, a student from far-flung Arunachal has sent a big interesting letter to Alina Tayang.
And it has been written, I will read the letter before you. Hon'ble Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when the result of my exam came, some people asked me if you read the Fam Warriors book
I told you, I haven't read this book
But, going back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was very good .
I thought, if I had read this book before Leam, I would have had a lot of benefits.
I liked many aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing the letter.
Fam Warriors 2-3 times to read, thank you
What you have said that if I get out during the new edition, I will definitely try to write some things for the participants and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share their experiences and suggest your suggestions on the aspects related to stress free exams.
I must study it .
I will think about it and I will try to write whatever I feel right out of it in my own words, in my own way, and maybe if your suggestions come more then my new ideas will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Tayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through newspapers, TV, and also discuss the busyness of the country.
But, you know, I'm a common man like you.
If there was someone else on this occasion, he would have become sad and disappointed, but, not his face, but he brought a smile on everyone's face with his words.
In his humility, simplicity and true sense, everyone was convinced that the form of sportsman spirit was observed in letter and spirit.
His talk was warmly welcomed by the present audience
Even after losing in a tough fight, he praised his opponent Nadal and gave the living evidence of the sportsman spirit.
On the other hand, however, Champion Nadal also highly appreciated Hanil's game.
The passion of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner was both worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is really worthy
Mani Kanchan Sanyog: Janmati Loksya Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person embraces merit and humility, he cannot win his heart again.
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people all over the world
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about is directly doing for your good.
It ' s very hard to stop it later .
But, if we initially wake up and stop it, then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel like, today, especially with my youth, I must talk about something.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health, and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
Everyone says so .
Tobacco intoxication is caused by nicotine present in it .
Due to its consumption in adolescence development of brain also gets affected .
But, today, I want to talk to you, a new subject
You would be aware that recently there has been a ban on e-cigarette in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from the normal cigarette.
While we understand the dangers of common cigarettes well, there has been a misconception about e-cigarette.
This error has been spread that there is no threat to e-cigarette.
Their effort is that no member of the family should smoke or smoke
They know that smoking, tobacco causes heavy loss to the body.
The drinker also knows and the seer also knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
There is not so much awareness among people about e-cigarettes.
They are also totally unaware of its danger and this is why sometimes e-cigarette secretly enters the house in curiosity.
Our youth walks on the path of waste and walks unknowingly
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it from the smell
In such a scenario, many adolescents and youngsters, ignorant and sometimes proud in the form of aashion statement, in the midst of their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes they are roaming around with their hands and they become victims of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country
e-cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Do not trample the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted
These diseases, these habits do not root in the society.
I urge you all to leave the addiction of tobacco and do not make any misunderstandings regarding e-cigarette.
Let us all together build a healthy India
You're supposed to have it.
Remember India, right
India means that if we go to gym for two hours in the morning and evening then it will happen.
This is our Mother India, this is our country, a multi-purpose Vasundhara.
Many human gems have emerged from this earth
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been the land of action
And these are the people who have spent their lives for themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honored in Vatican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Mary Thresia for the betterment of humanity in her life span of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to the field of social service and education.
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and stayed in this mission for life.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world. Today, when we are celebrating 150 years of Gandhi Ji, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single-seed plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, seeing the kind of lead that India has taken across the world, today the vision of all the countries is towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be going to be part of the campaign to get rid of Single see plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own way.
However, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I noticed his work, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand his new experiment.
Maybe these things could help the country and the people too.
Mr. Rippudman Belvi ji is making a unique effort they plogging
When I first heard the word plogging, it was new to me too.
Overseas , perhaps these words have been used in some quantities .
However, in India, Ripudman Belvi ji has propagated this thing very much.
Let ' s talk to them
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organised by the Ministry of Sports.
On 2nd October, these programmes are going to be organized across the country.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudaman ji how this programme should be done, what happens in the programme.
With this We shall not only take care of ourselves , but also protect our mother ' s health .
This campaign is creating awareness among the people about cleanliness as well as cleanliness.
I am confident that if 130 crore countrymen take one step in this direction then India will move 130 crore steps ahead towards the liberation of single use plastic.
Ripudaman ji, once again, thank you very much
And congratulations to you, your team, and for this new fantasy.
want to move forward to transform your life into a nation
One thing I want to remember in Advanced
However, in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will surely say it in detail but today I am asking you in advance so that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
So you start preparing right now .
I will talk in detail in detail but now it is time, some people can start practise and make some plans.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
Make a night, two night stay programme if you can have at least 15 places and that too.
You see, understand, experience India
How many diversities do we have
And when these festivals are celebrated on the occasion of Diwali, people go for it and therefore I would urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
Today our rank is thirty-four and five years ago our rank was at 65th position, that is, in a way we have put a big jump.
If we try more then by the time we complete 75 years of independence, we will make our place in the top places of the world in tourism.
See also that there will be no loss of any person in the days of Diwali than firecrackers and firecrackers
Whatever objection should be taken for this, you must be alarmed.
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard they have worked to create a Constitution of their own country full of diversity 
The Konkan coastal area, where the ocean has an important role, under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj, many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the seashores or were either surrounding the sea. The Maratha navy used the responsibility of protecting these forts. Maratha navy had combination of large ships and small boats in Maratha Navy, their naval personnel were very efficient to attack and defend any enemy.
Thinking of it is also afraid that there will be no soil, neither trees nor plants will grow, where will it be possible for human life
Where will it be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that Earth and Mother are seriously damaged by the use of more urea than required. How can a farmer be the son of the earth
Can our farmers, the sons of our soil, the children of our soil make a solemn pledge to revive the relationship of this mother-son once again whether they will stop using the amount of urea they use in their fields today, 2022, when 75 years of independence, half of their use will stop.
The person of North India will not know what is in South India
The person of West India will not know what is in East India
If we look at the diversity of our country, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam Ji, it is a matter of fact that when he misled India then he got a new inspiration to see and die for India. All these great personalities made a wide range of visits to India in the beginning of their work. They tried to understand and understand India in their own way. Can we, different states of our country, different societies, groups, their customs, their traditions, their cuisines and their beliefs try to live and understand India as a student
Can you keep IncredibleIndia (hash tag incredibleIndia) on
You see, if all the people of a state tell this thing then I will tell the government that they should scrutinize it and prepare publicity on the seven things that have come from every state that is, in a way, how should we promote tourist destination with the intentions of the people
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when news of violence comes from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry about it.
This is our country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the country of Sardar Patel who gave life to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence, respect and filled our hearts.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma:, we have been listening since childhood, have come
I want to assure the countrymen, those who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence, be it individuals or groups, these countries will never tolerate or tolerate the government.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life
Even our festivals are full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old, see cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, it will hardly be a day left in 365 days while we are not associated with any festival.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals go according to the leaflet in the time of nature.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly linked to the farmers and are associated with the fishermen.
Today, I am talking about festivals, first of all, I would like to call you all "Dukkadam"
Celebration of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society yesterday
In Jain society , festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra .
On the last day of the festival festival , festival is celebrated .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called the festival of forgiveness in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other 'Michami Dukkadam'.
Anyway , in our scriptures forgiveness is Virasya Bhushanam .
Forgiving is a hero
We have heard these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the characteristic of a powerful person.
Shakespeare wrote in his play The Merchant of Defense the significance of forgiveness, Mercy is two blessed, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes, that is, forgiveness and forgiveness, both get the blessings of God
My dear countrymen, these days Ganesh Chaturthi is shouting at every corner of India and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to talk about public festivals.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and the last 125 years before independence he had become a symbol of freedom movement.
And after independence, they have become symbols of social-education, social-consciousness.
Ganesh Chaturthi festival lasts for 10 days .
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
Greetings to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh Festival
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala
One of the colorful festivals of India, Onam is a major festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society as well as a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism.
And I would like to tell my countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the festival of Durga in Bengal, in a way it has become an attraction of tourism.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What we can do in that direction, we should think
A few days after the series of these festivals, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the countrymen on Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only symbols of faith and belief for us but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
In family life, festivals and sanitation are connected.
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness
This is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to create a social temper .
The insistence of public cleanliness should not only be in the house, in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, cleanliness should become an integral part of these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought process is, a scale has started to work in knowing all these things and you are aware of the environment.
Your own activities have eco-friendly, environment-friendly behavior that is against him.
In society , if it is against it , it is considered evil today .
And as a result of that, today I see that this Ganeshotsav has also eco-friendly Ganapati as if a big campaign has been started.
If you go to YouTube and see that in every household children are making Ganesh ji, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Likewise, every family is being used
See how big a change has changed and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago when Swachhata campaign was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
And, its positive results are visible
Coverage of toilets has reached about 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
A lot of people lost their lives but after the flood, when the water was reduced, so much dirt was lost everywhere.
At such a time, the workers of Jamiat UlemayiHind, in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat, cleared 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
He sweated himself, everyone went out
Excellent example of unity for cleanliness, such an example inspiring everyone, given by all the workers of Jamiat UlemayiHind.
The dedicated effort towards cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again on 2nd October, 15-20 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, the cleanliness hi service used to be said before.
Create an atmosphere for cleanliness all over the country
As opportunities come, wherever opportunities come, let us find opportunities.
But let ' s all join
Considering this as a preparation for Diwali, accept it as a preparation for Navratri in a way, accept the preparation of Durga Puja
My friends of social media can run some creative campaigns and inspire Virtual World to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp se Swachhta Competition, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organizing this campaign in which you are contesting essays, short film making competitions, painting competitions and competitions are being organized.
In this you can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit, no age limit.
You can make short films, make your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness
She can be in any language, she can be a silent one.
You see, this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine
You can imagine, after this 15-day cleanliness drive, on 2nd October, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, it will be a sacred joy to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I want to accept the loan of all of you in a special way.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart. It is not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long. I want to express my gratitude because millions of people join this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores, but millions of people sometimes write letters to me, sometimes give messages, sometimes on phone, I have a huge treasure.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than you wait for .
I ' m tempted because everything of you gets me to learn
You might also think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Aparna from Poona
I want to tell you about one of my friends
She always tries to help people , but I ' m surprised to see a habit of her
I went to the mall to shop with him once
He spent two thousand rupees on a sari comfortably and spent 450 rupees on the pizza, while the auto owner who had taken it to go to the mall had been bargaining for five rupees for a long time.
Buy vegetables on the way back and save 4-5 rupees by bargaining on every vegetable
I feel very bad
You must tell me about this .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you will be surprised, alert and maybe you will have decided not to make such a mistake in the future.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, when a ferryman comes to us, we are related to a small shopkeeper or seller of vegetables, sometimes we are related to an auto rickshaw driver. Whenever we have a relationship with a hardworking person, we start to negotiate with him.
And if we go to a big restaurant to eat food then we don't even see what is written in the bill, we pay the money in a dharma.
Not only this, we should buy saris in the showroom, we dont have any bargaining, but we dont live without negotiating with any poor person.
Have you ever thought of what will happen to the poor mind
Two rupees five does not make any difference in your life, but you have ever thought that this small habit of yours might have pushed his mind deeply.
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a message by calling the phone that touches the heart.
I am sure that my countrymen will surely abandon the habit of dealing with the poor .
My dear young friends, on 29th August the whole country celebrates as National Sports Day
This is the birthday of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey was incomparable
I am recalling that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Games become part of our lives
If we are young countries of the world, we should also look at these young playgrounds.
Sports i.e. physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement I understand what more is required
The game is in a way a very big herb of heart reconciliation .
The young generation of our country came forward in the field of sports and today in the era of computer, I would like to warn that playing field is more important than play-station.
Play A but also play out in the fields and sometimes act with Hootball.
Play crickets on the computer but the pleasure of playing crickets under the sky in the open ground is something else.
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and the mother used to ask when you'd come back.
Today the condition is that as soon as the children come home, they either get to see the cartoon ilm or get stuck on the mobile game and then scream at the mother and tell her when you will be out.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youth that IAF Under 17 World Cup is going to be organized in India from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests coming from all over the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share a very touching incident with the countrymen last week.
I got a chance to meet some daughters of very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Will spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will spend in water
With courage among the waves of the sea, these six daughters and this is the first incident in the world.
Who will be Hindustani who will not descend on these daughters
I salute these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModi App so that you can definitely read it because in a way this is a story of courage, a story of self-reliance and I will be glad to bring these daughters to you.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
The birthday of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji
He was the President , but throughout his life he used to present himself as a teacher .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow down to him, the great scientist, Albert Einstein had said.
It is the Supreme Court of the teacher to awaken job in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important feature of a teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge among your students.
This time , when we celebrate Teachers ' Day , can we all make a resolve together 
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode 
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Let's try to transform with this mantra.
Prime Minister's Office
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Howard University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been the subject of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world about the pundits of the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, we had started this campaign with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) campaign is taking three years tomorrow on 28th August
30 crore new households have been connected with it, bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I have a very big solution that within three years my poor brothers and sisters sitting at that end of the society have become a part of the original stream of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started coming to the bank, they have started saving money, they are feeling the security of the money.
Sometimes money is in hand, they live in a pocket, they live in a house, they want to spend their money.
If you want to do a good job in the coming days, money will work.
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks through our poor in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, this is a poor saving, this is his strength in the days to come.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the account opened has also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Rs.
In many families, due to insurance of one rupee, when a crisis arose on the poor man, the head of the family ended and within a few days he got Rs. 2 lakhs.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, be it Dalit or tribal or women or be it educated or be it educated or be it educated or be it educated or be it youth or be it intended to do something on your feet or be it the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana or be it the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana or be it the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana or be it the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Today it is not so much time but I would certainly ask the people of Bank to upload it on MyGov. in, people will get inspiration from it that how a scheme brings transformation in the lives of a person, how it fills new energy, how it fills new faith, how hundreds of examples of this thing have come to me.
I will make every effort to reach you and there is such an inspiring incident that the people of Media can take full advantage of it.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
The mind of man is such that the rainy season is a very attractive period for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature enjoys everybody on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a formidable form, it shows how powerful it is to destroy water.
Nature gives us life, keeps us alive, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, their horrific nature devastates us.
There is a very negative impact on the changing weather cycle and environment.
Over the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, have suffered a natural calamity due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a broader level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching.
State governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organizations, civil servants are also making every effort to help the people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the army, the people of the air force, the people of the NCR, the paramilitary forces, all of them join hands in serving the disaster victims at such times.
And 247 control room helpline number 1078 is working continuously to deal with the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by mock drill at the maximum places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were set up.
Gradually, we also made the nature that according to the weather forecast, we can also create our activities, so we can avoid losses.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time so many letters have come about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness about GST and also express their curiosity.
I would like to tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax-GST started in our country on the date of last month itself.
Can you tell me whether the results are coming after one month just as the government had expelled
I would like to hear your thoughts about it, thank you.
GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very happy that when someone poor writes a letter to me and tells me how the prices have come down due to GST, how things have become cheaper due to the needs of a poor person.
If a person living in north-east, remote mountains and forests writes that initially he was afraid of knowing what was wrong, but now when I started learning about it, I feel that it was easier than ever before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is, customers' confidence in the trader has started to grow.
Just now, I was seeing how GST had its impact on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How is the time decreasing to distance
Highways clutters are free.
Due to the speed of trucks, pollution has also decreased.
The goods are also reaching very early.
This is the facility, but at the same time, economic momentum is also strengthened.
Earlier, due to different tax structures, maximum resources of transport and logistics sector were required to be maintained and they had to create new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has indeed created a very positive impact on our economy in a very short time.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, the speed at which the migration has taken place, new registrations have taken place, it has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of the management, the pundits of technology, will definitely write the use of GST in the form of a model in front of the world.
There will be a case study for many universities of the world.
Because it is a huge height of success in itself to implement it and successfully move forward in such a huge country with such a huge challenge and involving crores of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it, all the states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with the consensus.
And the result of that is that every government has the same priority that there is no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries engaged in this work, all the departments, all the central and state government officials.
GST is a great example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but an economy that strengthens the culture of a new integrity.
In a way, there is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I salute crores of countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a comfortable way, we have been listening since childhood and this is the reason that the Non-Cooperation Movement started on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement commenced on 9th August, 1942, known as the August Revolution and the country was freed on 15th August, 1947.
In a way, several incidents in the month of August are particularly linked to the freedom struggle.
But very few people know that this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali to leave India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who were associated with the freedom struggle, struggled and endured, the pages of history are our inspiration for the creation of a grand India.
What can be a bigger inspiration than our freedom fighters have sacrificed, penance and sacrificed.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had envisaged the entire country for the freedom from the British Raj.
This was the time when the people of India had become a part of the uit India Movement in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, whether it is illiterate, poor or rich.
People's anger was at its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were staging their lives in a struggle with the mantra of Do or Die.
Millions of youth in the country had left their studies, had left books.
The non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The form of non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that the great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
There was public support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all these successes.
The whole country was fighting together.
And I sometimes think that if we look at the pages of history by adding a little, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
Starting from 1857, the freedom struggle continued in some corner of the country every moment till 1942.
This long period created the heart of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to doing something or the other.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, join, go, go, come, join and join new ones and the country continued to strive every moment to overthrow the British kingdom.
With this hard work from 1857 to 1942, this movement created a situation that reached its peak in 1942 and played the role of uit India that the British had to go within 5 years in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached out to the people.
And from 1942 to 1947, for five years, this kind of masses became a peoples mind, with the success of five decisive years of siddhi, they became the reason for the country's independence.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want you to connect with this mathematics.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's been 70 years.
Governments came and went.
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone has made every effort in their own way to free the country from problems.
Success also got.
Expectations also awakened
Like 1942 to 1947, there were five decisive years of perfection.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year-old segment of accomplishment has come to our fore.
On 15th August, 2017, we will celebrate the solemn pledge and when we will be 75 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform that pledge into a reality.
There are crores of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolutions.
So as 1942 to 1947 became the decisive decisive destiny for the country's independence, these five years can be decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then all of us have to take a firm resolve today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolve.
We have to associate ourselves with this August Monsoon resolution and we have to resolve.
Come, from August 9 this month, from August 9, run a Mahabhayan of Siddhi with resolution.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Young organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
New ideas can be highlighted.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute to as a person
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Using technology, videos, posts, blogs, articles, new ideas have come up with all these things.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
This ui is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread and propagate it.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am only a person who doesn't speak.
The voice of 1. 25 billion Indians echoes from the Red Fort.
Attempts are made to verify their dreams and I am happy that from every corner of the country on August 15 for the last 3 years, I get suggestions that what should I say on August 15 What issues should I take
This time also I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov either on NarendraModiApp.
I myself read it and I will try to reveal it in the time I have on August 15.
In the last three years, I have received a complaint in my 15th August speech that my speech becomes a bit longer.
I have tried to make rules for me in 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
But I intend to try this time how to shorten my speech .
See whether success is achieved or not.
My countrymen, I want to talk about another thing today.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate that.
Our festivals, our festivals, are not just occasions of joy and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And a natural joy is also added to these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Adds person and society.
A simple journey from person to world runs.
It becomes an opportunity to move from ego to yam.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making rakhi in small domestic industries from several months before Rakhi.
From khadi to silk threads, nobody knows how many rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis.
Rakhi makers, rakhi sellers, sweets, thousands of crores of businesses get connected with a festival.
Our poor siblings and families go with this.
We burn a lamp in Deepawali, it is not just a light festival, it is just a festival, it is an adornment of the house.
His direct relation is with those poor families who make small earthen lamps.
But today when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
I have seen that sometimes I think the countrymen are more conscious than me, they are more active.
For the last one month, citizens conscious of the environment have written me letters.
And he has urged you to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people can plan on the choice of soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such conscious citizens.
They have urged me to say this topic before time.
This time the public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
25 billion Indians, Lokmanya Tilak ji had started a public Ganeshotsav with the basic spirit of unity and social awareness and collectivity.
Once again, let us compete essays, discuss meetings, remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak in this year of Ganeshotsav.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefits will be that the poor artisans, the poor artists who make sculptures will get employment, the poor will get their stomach.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals, festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that be it the field of education, economic sector, social sector, sports, our daughters are illuminating the country and attaining new heights.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
In the past, our daughters performed well in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to them but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win, it was a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face too, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said, nowadays, the time of media is such that the expectations are increased so much, so much is increased and when success is not achieved then it also gets converted into anger.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail, then the anger of the country breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and talk about such things, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, then 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters praised and glorified what they did.
I see it a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you people have got such a good fortune that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won hundred and fifty million people.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Revolution, once again on 9th August, once again on 15th August, once again on 15th August, I recall the year 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to fulfil his resolve.
We all have to take the country to new heights, to reach and to reach.
Come, let us go together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will be better and the future will be better. Go ahead with this belief.
Weather is changing
This time the heat is also very much
But it ' s good that the rain is moving on your footsteps in time .
In many parts of the country, Jhajjham rain has made the weather pleasant
After the rain the cold winds have been experiencing relief from the heat of the past .
And all of us have seen that however difficult it is in life, however stressful it is, individual life, in public life, the arrival of rains only changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
And the poor of the country is connected with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor
And very few people will know that there is a word in English, juggernaut and that means a magnificent chariot that no one can stop.
And in the Dictionary Meaning of this juggernaut, it is also found that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my greetings to all my fellow citizens and also bow down to Lord Jagannath ji on the occasion of his visit.
India's diversity is its specialty, India's diversity is also the power of India.
The sacred month of Ramadan celebrated all the distances in prayer with sacredness
Now is the festival of Eid
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all of you on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
Ramzan month is the month of virtue donation, the month of distribution of happiness and the happiness that they share, the happiness increases.
Let us all share the treasures of happiness with inspiration from these holy festivals.
In this holy month of Ramadan , a great motivation came to me in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh .
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in that small village, in a way more population belongs to brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together .
And within this individual toilet aid is provided by the government , and the assistance was given to them about 17 lakh rupees .
You spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for reversing this holy occasion of Ramzan for the betterment of the society.
We know that there are three such states in our country, Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, which have already been declared Open Defecation Free
This week Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared
I express my special gratitude to the administration, governance and people-to-people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We know very well that if we have to do something good in the life of a person, in the life of a society then we have to work very hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if we have to fix it, we have to strive to be very conscious for a long time.
Then goes to the body, the habit of mind changes
The subject of cleanliness is similar
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone will have to draw attention
Good motivational events will have to be remembered again and again
And I am happy that sanitation has not been a government programme today
It is becoming a mass movement of the masses and the masses.
And how powerful is the people who sit in the regime when they take up this task in public participation
In the past, a very good event came to my mind, which I would surely like to say to you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took up a big job with public participation
100 hour non-stop campaign
And what was the goal 
Construction of ten thousand household toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in one hundred hours
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a very inspiring example in the culmination of hard work.
Narendra Modi visits App, visits MyGov. in, comes from letters, come to AIR.
Shri Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the Emergency, has written that on 25th June he has presented as a black age in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi ji's awareness about democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a ritual.
Democracy needs regular awareness and therefore democracy has to be reminded of the traumatic aspects and move forward towards the good things of democracy.
June 25, 1975 was such a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into a prison.
Anti-voice was dumped.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jayaprakash Narayan, were imprisoned.
The judicial system was also unable to escape the shadow of the terrible form of emergency.
Newspapers were completely wasted.
The lovers of democracy fought a very big fight and when a country like India, such a huge country, whenever they got the opportunity, how democracy prevailed in the veins of the people of India, they demonstrated that strength through elections.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the pride of doing something high in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - The whole world has become Yoga-based.
People from water to mountains welcomed the rays of the sun in the morning through yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this
Its not that yoga was not the first time but today when Yoga is tied to the thread, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
In China, people practiced Yoga on The Great Fall of China, then people performed Yoga on World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru at a height of 2400 meters above sea level.
In France, people performed Yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower.
In a small place like Singapore, programmes were organised at 70 locations and a week long campaign was organised.
NCC has taken out 10 stamps of International Day of Yoga.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at NCC Deadquarters.
NCC sta, Diplomats of the world have participated in it.
Once again Yoga has done the work of world records
Nearly 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad made a new world record by joining hands in Gujarat
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the good fortune of doing yoga in the rain
Our soldiers have also done yoga in Siachen where there is a minus 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature.
Whether it is TBP or RPF or ISO, everyone has made Yoga a part of their own duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of family should share their photo while doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried this forward.
Sir, one of my questions is that we had heard you in Kerala that we should give kind of good boxes instead of what we give on different-diversity places as a memento
You had started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but we are not able to see this much right now.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we will not give a bouquet, we will give a book or handkerchief.
And the handkerchief of Khadi so that Khadi can also be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we all had become habituated, but after coming here I had missed that habit.
But went to Kerala, once again she became aware
And I have just started giving the following information in the government
We can gradually make a temperament
And bouquet ' s AYUSH is very low
Once taken in hand, then leave
But if you give a book, in a way it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
And when I am talking about this, how historical is the value of such things
When I went to K last year, Fueen Liabeth of Britain invited me to dinner in London.
There was a native atmosphere
He also did a meal with great love, but later he showed me a handkerchief woven with a small khadi and a thread and shining in his eyes, he said that when I was married, then this handkerchief was sent by Mahatma Gandhi to me in a meeting as a good wish for marriage.
How many years have passed, but this handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi has been kept in mind.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be victims of criticism.
But in spite of that, we should continue to do such things, we should keep trying.
Now I cannot say that if I go anywhere and if someone brings a bouquet then I will not be able to refuse it.
But still there will be criticism, but continue to talk, then gradually there will be improvement.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are several types of work.
They are immersed in files but I have developed a habit for me that I read a few letters daily from the letters that come to me and that gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different types of letters come, different types of people write letters
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I think I must tell you.
In the far south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife of Madurai Arulmozhi Servann - he sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in my family, then I would be able to provide some financial support to the family.
So I started some work in the direction of supplying money from the bank and bringing some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Government of India.
So I have registrated myself in it. I want to tell my countrymen that if you get a chance then you will get an opportunity.
is a big new kind of system .
And then we have to order it
So all the departments of the government are watching those who registry within the GDM.
Because there are no middlemen , things are very cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has given all the registry of the goods that he can give on this website of the government.
And the interesting thing is that the letter they have written to me is very interesting.
This is empowerment .
This is the opportunity to promote enterpriseship
Perhaps if Arulmozhi ji had not written to me, I would not have noticed that a housewife is doing a small job far away from the system of GM, his goods can be purchased to the Prime Minister's Office.
That ' s the strength of the country
There is also transparency in it, there is an empowerment in it, there is also an entrepreneurship in it.
I would like to say that those who want to sell their goods to the government in this way, they should add more and more.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Governance is a great example of this and its goal is Minimum Price and Maimum Lease, Efficiency and Transparency
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the Yoga-related ground then our dreams are also to cross those horizons of the far flung heavens.
In the past, India has shown a lot in sports and science too.
Today, India is waving its best not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And these satellites include Frass, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA - around 14 countries.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of farming, in the field of natural calamity.
And this is the most weighing heavily satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it with the weight of the elephant, so you can imagine how much our scientists have done in the field of space.
On June 19 , a thousand days of the Mars mission were completed .
You would be aware that when we successfully made a place in the orbit for the Mars mission, this entire mission was for a period of six months.
The completion of a thousand days is an important halt within our scientific journey, within our space journey.
In these sports too, we see that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has come to notice that our young generations have started showing their future in sports as well as in sports. And because of our players, their talent, their achievements, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, Badminton player Kidambi Srikanth of India has increased the value of the country by winning the Indonesia Open
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement
I had the opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Athletes PT Usha jis share school of athletics a few days ago.
We also bring sports, sportsman spirit as much as we promote sports.
Sports also plays a very important role in the development of personality
The overall personality development of the game is very important.
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family too, then they should be given opportunities.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of continuous festivals, in a way this period feels new.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and I will talk to you again during the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rain is awaiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has already begun.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, on this auspicious month.
This is a country that believes in God and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, all kinds of ideology, all kinds of worship, all kinds of traditions, all kinds of traditions, all of us have assimilated the art of living together.
And after all, religion, creed, ideology, tradition, these messages give us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramadan will certainly help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a lot of people gave me feedback.
Personally, everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me my point of view.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not even heard anyone's message, so many things have come.
However, I have seen from Sarasari sight that somebody has tried to learn music, some have tried a new instrument, some people are trying to learn new things using YouTube and are trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing nature, living, understanding is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I experienced how much struggle India had to struggle for independence, how much sacrifice it had to be made, how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to todays generation on this subject.
I am happy that the young generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country and about them.
Many years ago I went to Andaman and Nicobar.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a very famous book in jail.
They used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of tortures the freedom fighters would have suffered
When I read a book on Savarkar ji's birth, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, it is a very motivational one.
There was no such state in India, there would be no speaker in India who would not have spent his youth in the Andaman jail, in this Cellular Jail, while facing the punishment of black water for freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I would certainly tell the young generation of the country that what kind of torment we had faced, what kind of torment we had faced, if we go to Cellular Jail and see why it was called black water.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurture better planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times that the world that we will not see is our duty to worry about it, we should also care about it.
Open the room windows, open the doors, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
When the Panch Mahabharata is connected to those five epics then a new consciousness is revealed in our body, a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this, but we do not register it, we do not add it in a thread, in a formula.
After that you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore the global campaign to join nature on June 5 should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root of power.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way, the biggest guiding text of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told that Mata Bhoomi: Sono ego isolation:
It has been said in the Vedas that the purity in us is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is obvious that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana was under three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A massive plantation drive is going on in almost all the states as soon as it rains.
Plants are planted in crores.
Children of schools are also connected, socio-service organizations are associated, NGOs are connected, the government itself takes initiative.
Let us also promote and contribute to this work of plantation in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a day of learning for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day of 21st June has already spread in every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, many forces of scattering in the world are showing their distorted face, at such a time India has a huge contribution to the world.
We have added the world to a formula through yoga.
As yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to the lifestyle, due to the increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
And even at a young age, this situation has reached.
Taking non-vegetarian medicines and passing the day, the role of yoga is important for living a stress-free life in such a clock.
Yoga is a guarantee of both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga to experience an interval of health from the body, from the body, from the thoughts, from the ethics.
Just two days back, I have written a letter to all the governments of the world, all the leaders about Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga and announced some prizes.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and you should appeal that this time three generations of the same family will do yoga together on the third International Yoga Day.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents or grandparents or sons or daughters, all the three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be an elegant coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had launched the campaign of selfie with daughter, there was a very interesting experience.
These three-generation pictures will definitely create curiosity for the country and the world.
You must send me a picture on the NarendraModiApp, on MyGov where three generations of people do yoga.
This will be a picture of tomorrow, today and tomorrow, which will be a guarantee tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks to celebrate International Day of Yoga.
You should also spread the subject of yoga for three weeks continuously, broadcast it, connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite all of you to join this.
This phone call will also help you: Pranam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see that wherever you go, the people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
The elderly, the children have also got awareness about cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, staging.
There the government machinery works as cleaning, but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are plenty of cleaning programs.
Media also gives him great importance, just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
Very big cleaning campaign run there.
I didn't even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking and I saw that this thing is correct.
You can imagine, knowing how pleasant I am, and the country is also notifying these things in a better way.
I would be happy to know that cleanliness has also been linked to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be a habit, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is enjoyable and inspiring for any hygiene in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized the work of this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do this or not.
Modi ji, while deciding your stay, ask whatever migration you want, if you want to invite me, what will be the level of cleanliness
On the basis of how many tons of waste you will offer me a visit.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big will it be for humanity
One thing I would certainly like to say that we do not consider this waste to be waste, it is wealth, it is a resource.
Do not look at it just as a garbage.
Once we start accepting this waste as wealth then many new methods of waste management will come forward.
The Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of waste management with the help of the State Governments, with the help of the representatives of the cities.
Solid waste and liquid waste are going to be available in about 4,000 cities of the country on the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one of the green color and the other of the blue color.
Like the waste of kitchen, vegetable peels, remaining food, egg peels, leaves of trees and plants, all these are wet wastes and put them in green dustbin.
All these things are those things which are used in the fields, if you remember the colour of the field, you will remember what to put in the green dustbin.
Today, I have to proudly mention one thing - if a person decides then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is similar.
And the way in which he connected the people of the entire region and converted them into a mass movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir, I was told that the Reasi Block has become open defecation free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been flooded the most - the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He himself took out torch trips to spread awareness and inspired people from homes, streets and streets.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days and months, be it newspapers, TV channels or social media, three years of the present government are being accounted for.
I see this process as a very healthy signs.
This 3-year term has been done on every criterion.
The people of every section of the society have analyzed it.
And there is a great process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, public should give account of their work.
I thank all those who took time to discuss our work in depth, appreciate it somewhere, somewhere supported, somewhere deficiencies were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
It is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, to learn from it and to move forward with the help of it.
Constructive Criticism strengthens democracy.
For a conscious nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the effect of everything is similar to that on me as on the mind of a common citizen.
Mann Ki Baat sees him as a one-sided dialogue, some people criticise him politically but after such a long experience I feel that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even imagine it.
It seems as if I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about home.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I express my gratitude to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker Madam that he took out the time and the people sitting in such a senior office gave this importance to the matter of mind.
In a way, gave a new dimension to the matter of mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on this book of mind, they had ever discussed with me.
Akbar Saheb proposed from the front that the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat want to create a sketch of it through his art and Akbar Saheb gave the form of art to express his love without taking any single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, by the time we meet next time, there will have been rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the beginning of a new life will start.
Come, let us all go ahead in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
s.
What can be a little emphasis on this aspect in the skill development
You run a cycle but have you ever tried to run a cycle with a three-wheeler cycle
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the exam of their children.
Those whose exams have finished, there will be an excitement of some relief and where the exams will run, there will still be some preservation in those families.
But at such a time, I would like to say that the last time I have talked about the things that I have talked about with the students, you will certainly be able to get those things done during the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu
And I wish Bangladesh to move forward, develop and also assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region by joining hands and shoulders.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are a shared heritage.
National Anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize but also the title of Knighthood by the British.
And when the British slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who raised their voices and this was the period when this incident had a profound effect on the minds of a 12-year-old child.
In adolescence, the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to that boy laughing and smiling in the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat was our beloved, inspired by all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British. And we all know that the incident of March 23 - the satisfaction of serving mother India on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life had been incorporated for the freedom of mother India.
And these three heroes are still inspired by us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the whole British kingdom was afraid of these three young men
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but the British used to worry about how to move forward with them.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23
Was stolen, which is not usually done
And later, by bringing his body to todays Punjab, the British had burnt it quietly.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would certainly like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get a chance, whenever they go to Punjab, they must replace Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, the mother of Bhagat Singh and the grave of Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the glory of freedom, its intensity, its expansion continued to grow.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi performed Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha
In the freedom movement of India, the Gandhian thought and Gandhian style, its first appearance appeared in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire freedom struggle, especially in the spirit of struggle.
It was that period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-labourers in Ahmedabad, and all of them had a profound impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and style of functioning.
In 1915, Gandhi came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
We cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind today.
Imagine a person who returned to India in 1915, just two years of his tenure
Neither the country knew them, nor had their influence, it was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer at that time, how hard they had to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi, through his behavior, organising, motivating and bringing the poorest, illiterate person in front of the British Sultanate to the battlefield, shows this wonderful power.
And so the way we realize Mahatma Gandhi ' s grandeur
But if you think about the Gandhi of Champaran Satyagraha a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started public life.
We can learn from them how to start public life, how hard we have to work ourselves and how Gandhi did it.
And that was the time when we listen to the names of the big leaders, Gandhi had sent everyone to the villages be it Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani Ji.
On one hand, filling the jail, on the other hand, consuming yourself in creative work.
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's style of functioning.
What is the word satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a great kingdom - a new vibhavana Gandhi had established it not through words, but through a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, then who will be the Indian who does not want to change India, who will be the Indian who does not want to be a partner in the change in the country
India is neither a government programme nor a political party's manifestation nor a project.
India is the call of 1. 25 billion Indians.
This is the feeling that 1. 25 billion Indians want to make a grand India together
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are a lot of people who are hungry and worry about their food.
Our country is polygamous
Public service is the service of God, it is in our veins
Once we look at it as a collectivity, organised form, then how powerful it is
It is very natural to criticize, discuss, look at it from a different perspective and it is essential in democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians make a solemn pledge, if they make a solemn pledge then the dream of a New India can be fulfilled in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are done by the budget, by the government project, by the government money.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities honestly, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diesel in my life.
You see, the dream of a New India that 1. 25 billion Indians are dreaming of will be realized in front of their eyes.
It means that every citizen follows his civil religion, follows his duty
Why shouldn't we engage with Swaraj by disciplining our lives in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I also want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, a large number of people have participated in the Digital Payments Digital Movement.
Without cash transactions, its curiosity has increased, it is also trying to learn from the poorest of the poor. And gradually people are moving towards it without cash transactions.
Since the demonetisation ban on bondage, there has been considerable increase in different methods of digital payment.
My dear countrymen, we have to carry forward the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians can pledge to work for 2,500 crore digital transactions in one year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You do not imagine, but you can serve the country very well and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several Digidhan Mela programmes have been organized for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolve to do 100 programs across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward scheme
Nearly 12. 5 lakh people have received this reward of consumer
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
And as it was decided a long time ago, on 14th April this digital mela will be concluded on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
A very big event is going to be held after a hundred days .
There is also a provision for a large draw
How to reduce the cash, how to reduce the behavior of notes, let us contribute to it
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, whenever I ask people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there are many suggestions.
But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on cleanliness .
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a 11th student, has sent a message by phone: - Hon'ble Principal, Prime Minister, you are my salute
First of all, congratulations to you that you have won this election with huge votes.
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is
I go daily through the river in which people put a lot of garbage and contaminate the rivers.
That river comes through the Rispana bridge and also comes to my house
For this river we went to the towns and took out a rally and talked to the people but it did not benefit.
I want to tell you that this should be highlighted by sending a team or through a newspaper, thank you.
See, brothers and sisters, how much pain is the daughter of 11th class
How much anger is there on seeing the garbage in that river
I think it ' s a good sign .
This is what I want to say. 25 billion countrymen get angry with dirt.
Once there will be anger, anger, fury against him, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, he is also suggesting me, but at the same time he himself is also saying that he made a lot of efforts but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
Hate towards dirt is also increasing .
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, it has its own importance.
But hygiene is more related to the habit of movement
The work is difficult, but it has to be done.
I am confident that the feelings that have awakened in the new generation of the country, in the boys, in the students, in the youth, indicates a good result in itself.
I would like to tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been receiving several suggestions on one thing from the very beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about food waste.
Half of the plates they fill in are not filled in the stomach and then they leave.
You have ever imagined how much waste we are doing with the junk that we leave.
Have you ever thought that if you don't leave junk, then how many poor people can fill their stomachs
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
However, when the mother serves the small children in our family, she says, "Son, take as much food as you can.
There are some attempts but still the indifference on this subject is a social treachery.
There is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is savings then the family also has economic benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this is a matter of fact that the family also benefits.
I am not urging you too much on this subject, but I would like this awareness to increase.
You will find such people in every state of India.
His life can also inspire us not to combine.
We should take as much as we have to eat.
See, these are the ways for change.
And those who are aware of health always say - keep a little empty stomach, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on 7th April.
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word expression, but if there is a literal meaning then some people also call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally and preserved.
The trouble is that we cannot understand this thing in our neighbourhood and perhaps we are hesitant to talk about it openly.
Anyone who feels depression himself does not speak anything because he feels a bit embarrassed.
I would like to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is, instead of suppression of expression, its expression is needed.
Your friends, friends, parents, brothers, teachers, openly tell me what is happening.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children living in hostels, suffer more.
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, he says - No, I don't want to come today - I like to stay alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does that 
You must believe that it is the first step in the direction of expression.
If he doesn't like to live in a group of people, he is going alone in a corner then try not to let this happen.
Give him an opportunity to interact with such people who openly talk to him.
Let us motivate him to express his joy and joy while talking about it. Please take out what kind of frustration is there inside him.
This is the best remedy
And depression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases
Like the diabetes becomes a host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities in fighting, taking courage and deciding.
Your friends, your family, your premises, your environment can stop you from going to the expression and if you have gone then you can bring it out.
There is another way.
Please help them, share their happiness and sorrow, you will see that the pain within you will go away in the same way.
If you try to understand their sorrows, you will do it with service, you will have a new confidence in them.
By connecting with others, serving someone, and serving selflessly, you can easily lighten the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot to get rid of stress, to get rid of pressure, to move towards a happy mind.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year.
If you have any suggestions regarding the third International Yoga Day in your mind, you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application and guide me.
Whatever songs, poetic compositions you can prepare, you should do that so that people can easily understand it.
I would also like to talk to my mothers and sisters today because today we have come out with a lot of talk about health.
So in the past, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome but at the same time, women have special responsibilities.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision.
These working class women will now be given 26 weeks of Maternity Leave at the time of delivery, at the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery and at the time of delivery.
Perhaps there are only two or three countries in the world which are ahead of us.
India has taken a very important decision for these sisters.
And its original objective is to take care of that newborn, the future citizen of India, to take care of it at the beginning of his birth, to get a lot of love from the mother, then these children will grow up and become the wealth of the country.
The health of mothers will also be good and that is why this is a very important decision.
And this will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April is the holy festival of Ram Navami, on 9th April is Mahavir Jayanti, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the life of all these great men continue to inspire us and give us the strength to resolve for a New India.
After two days Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Samvatsar, I extend my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
This is the time for farmers to get the fruits of their hard work and start cooking after spring.
This New Year is celebrated in different corner of our country in different forms.
Gudi-Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as a New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Samvatsar Puja in the region of Awadh, Twin-Sheetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani festival in Magadha takes place on New Year.
India is a country full of so many diversities.
The winter season is going to go now .
The spring season has knocked us all in life .
After leafying , new leaves start coming to the trees .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The color of the birds begins to feel like the mind .
Not only flowers, fruits also appear shining in the sun on the branches of the tree
Fruits of summer are seen in the spring of mango .
At the same time, yellow flowers of mustard in the fields tied the hopes of the farmers
Tsu or palash flower indicates the arrival of holi .
Wealthy Khusro has described the moments of this change of weather .
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint happiness in human life
In an environment full of love, brotherhood, humanity, we are going to leave Phalgun for the last month and are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
Indeed , these two months are a coincidence .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of citizens of the country for the fact that before the matter of mind, when I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On the NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And so he said I ' ll give you some information about the launch and interceptor missiles of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, thank you very much that you remembered the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world or to reach out to knowledge or information technology, science has recorded its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in the life of India
Our scientists have proudly elevated India to the world
SRD has successfully launched 104 satellites in space through Mega Mission, including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together in space.
And it is also heartening to note that this is a successful launch of the 38th PSL
This is a historic achievement for SR, but for the entire India.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is very important - artosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will help in the mapping of resources, infrastructure, estimation of development and planning of urban development.
Particularly my farmer brothers and sisters, this new satellite artosat 2 will help us a lot on all these topics.
Our satellite has sent a few pictures as soon as it goes.
He's started his work
It is also a matter of happiness for us that all these campaigns have been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a tremendous participation of youth and women is a very proud aspect in the success of ISR
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always kept their objective of bringing space science to the common people, to serve the nation and they are also creating new records.
The more we congratulate these scientists, their entire team, the less we are
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is about the security of India
India has achieved a great achievement about it.
It has not been much discussed yet, but Shobha ji has noticed this important thing.
Interception technology driven this missile during its trial and marked success by stacking enemy missiles at an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the ground.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are hardly four or five countries in the world that have this mastery.
When we see new technology, there is a new scientific achievement, we are happy.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those who possess talent, do not let the curiosity remain in the form of curiosity, they also raise questions within it, find new curiosities and create new curiosities.
And that curiosity becomes the reason for a new discovery
They do not sit in peace until they get the answer
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not complete.
Full stop is impossible
Efforts to know the universe, the rules of the universe, the mind of man are constantly going on.
New science, new technology is generated from that.
And every technology, every new form of science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young men, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, sometimes I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our youth should increase the attraction for science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientist causes a permanent change in the life of future generations .
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major unity type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation was invited
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science to solve .
I mean to say that in the society, people of this kind of role are very much in the country.
And our society is also becoming technology driven.
Arrangements are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
There is a big force on digi-money in the past
Gradually people are moving from cash to digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are growing at a rapid pace.
In our country, Lucky Customer Plan, Digi-Dhan Business Plan has received huge support.
It's been almost two months, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of happiness that under the Digi-Dhan Yojana so far, more than 10 lakh people have been rewarded, more than 50 thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received prizes of fifty-five thousand rupees.
Whether it is farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are getting benefits.
When I asked his analysis, See, only youngsters come to see that even older people come, I am glad that there are 15-year-olds among those who receive the prize, so there are also sixty-six-seven elderly people.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on NarendraModiApp that he got a reward of one thousand rupees under the Lucky Client Scheme.
Now they drive a car but in a way they have become ambassadors of this scheme.
All the passengers are given the knowledge of digital all the time.
They keep telling about things with so much enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, and the Lucky Customer Scheme, either the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, the rewards they have received, to become an Ambassador of this kind.
You should lead this movement.
Please take this forward and in a way this work has a very important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, in my view, there is a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way, you are a soldier of cleanliness.
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - Hundred days when completed.
14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On 14th April, a huge draw of crores of rupees is going to be drawn.
There are about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar 
Just now, the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has been celebrated.
This time the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the CBI.
I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
The BHIM App has to be delivered to 125 crore hands by connecting everyone to every household.
The impact of the movement that has taken place in the last two-three months is that several townships, villages and cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed immensely to the root of our country's economy.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you a lot of happiness today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill up the food grains.
With the hard work of the farmers in our country, record food production has been done this year.
All the indications are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there has been a wave of crops in the fields like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is 8 more than the last record of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and cultivated various pulses on nearly two hundred ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are particularly grateful for the way the farmers of my country have worked hard on their heads and eyes and produced records of pulses.
My dear countrymen, this has been going on in this direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organizations, by everyone.
In a way, everyone is seen to be aware of cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government has been making constant efforts.
In the past, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, was organized in Telangana.
And it is not just a seminar in the closed rooms of Warangal in the state of Telangana, but it is important to use the work of direct sanitation.
On 17-18 February, I had organized a toilet pit emptying exercise in Hyderabad.
Six house toilet pits were evacuated and cleaned and officials themselves showed that the pits used for twin pit toilets can be evacuated and reused.
They also showed how convenient the toilets of this new technology are and there is no inconvenience in cleaning them, there is no hesitation in it, which is a psychological barrier, it is also not a hindrance.
And we can also clean the pit of a toilet just like that.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has propagated this thing very much, it has given importance to it and it is natural that when an ICD is being promoted.
If the ASH officer cleanses the pit of the toilet himself then it is very natural to see the attention of the country.
And this is the cleaning of toilet pit and one of those whom we consider as garbage but from the point of view of fertilizers, this is a kind of black gold.
We can see what happens from waste to wealth.
And that ' s proved
A standard Two Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected in another pit.
In six-twelve months, the waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed.
It is very safe to handle decomposed waste and is very important fertilizer in terms of manure NPK
Farmers are well aware of NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium are full of nutrients and it is considered to be a very good manure in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken these initiatives, the others too have made such initiatives.
And now Doordarshan has a special programme of Swachhta News
The more such things will be exposed, the more it will be beneficial.
The government also celebrates Swachhta Pakhwada regularly.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with them Tribal Affairs Ministry, are going to strengthen the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping Transport and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these Ministries are also going to carry forward the cleanliness drive for the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, it increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance performed by our Divyang players at Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India has enhanced the pride of the country by defeating Pakistan for the second consecutive World Championship.
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievement of our Divyang friends
I always believe that brothers and sisters with disabilities are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every moment we can get to learn something from them
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
They are moving ahead with step by step and illuminating the country with their achievements .
In the last few days, Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy our women players won the silver medal
Congratulations to all those players
8th March celebrates World Women's Day
In India too, giving importance to daughters, increased awareness about them in family and society, increased sensitivity
Beti Bachao Beti Teach this movement is progressing at a fast pace
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a campaign of social sensitivity, public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common sense, has forced people to think about this burning issue in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of the people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When we get the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a daughter, so much joy comes
In a way, positive thinking towards daughters is causing social acceptance
I have heard that Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu state has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
District administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60,000 daughters under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana. Besides organizing Gram Sabhas, efforts are being made by the district administration to adopt orphan girls and ensure their education.
A campaign to educate Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Daughters is being launched in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-school the girls who had been drop-out by running their own school campaign and to motivate them to study again.
I mean to say that Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho This movement has also taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are linked to him
It is diverted as per local requirements .
You ' re also actively connected
I get a lot to know from you
What is going on on on earth, what is going on in the minds of the village, the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution
Tomorrow, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated across India.
Someone can imagine what kind of personality it will be like that, even after thousands of years, every festival comes with innovation, with new inspiration, with new energy and thousands of years old life can be such that even today, who can give examples, inspire, everyone can find solutions to the problems of the present, in the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes the task of raising rocks, sometimes picking up leaf leaf i. e.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, who was born on the banks of the Yamuna, went to the coast of the sea in Gujarat, settled in the city of Dwarka and who was born on the banks of the river, came to the bank of Yamuna and breathed his last in Delhi, his life.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had utilised his duties, his ability, his thinking in the circumstances of that time, thousands of years ago, to avoid the war, to avoid the struggle, to avoid the struggle, to fulfil his duties and to fulfil his duties. And the Charkhadhari Mohan had also chosen such a path for freedom, to save human values, to empower the basic elements of personality - for this the war of freedom has given such a form which is unique to the whole world, even today it is unique.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling in the midst of all the ups and downs of life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why Shri Krishna and Jagatguru have also been known as Krishna Vande Jagadgurum.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is discussed not only in India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
They served those farmers with whom Champaran was being discriminated, they served those mill workers who were not being given proper wages, they considered the service of the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry, the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whoever, whenever needed, was always present for the service of Mahatma Gandhi
He not only emphasized service but also emphasized on self-confidence associated with it.
The meaning of the word service is that it should be done with pleasure - service , religion :
But, at the same time, the feeling of excellent joy, joy and happiness is also inherent in service.
We can understand this from Bapu's life very well.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and the society, humanity and humanity.
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, in a unique way, he always emphasized on social promotion community mobilisation.
It has been my privilege that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to insist on organising the spirit of service.
Social-Service and Social-Promotion Community Service and Community Mobilisation This spirit that we have to bring into our practical life
In fact, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true karyanjali
No countrymen
And collectivity has its own strength
There should be collectiveness and service in this entire, 150 programmes of Gandhiji.
Our ladies are club
They will continue to do the work of modern age ladies clubs. However, all the members of the ladies club together will do some or the other service work.
can do a lot
Gather books to the old, the poor, disseminate knowledge, and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore enterprises.
There is no limit to those who come to the mind - just goodwill, goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and service to the spirit of full dedication and that too for the realization of a unique joy
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I had inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The emotions that have arisen from within your mind will be stronger than any great literature creation and it may be that in today's times, in your eyes, the form of a Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps even more relevant.
A lot of programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were particularly interesting in it.
You will remember that there was a congressional session in Haripura, Gujarat where the event of Subhash Chandra Bose's President Delegation was recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Prior to the Haripura session of Congress, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Kala Bhawan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase their heart work during the session.
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose heart work enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
gives a new identity to the constitution .
And his art sadhana has immortalized the Constitution as well as Nand Lal Bose.
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and finally made some art canvas showing the lives of rural India.
This precious artwork had a tremendous discussion.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, along with best wishes, I expect some resolution from every Indian.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for someone else
This will be a good, true, authentic function to Bapu
Sons of Mother India, you will remember that in the last few years, we have been running Swachhta Hi Seva campaigns across the country for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it starts on September 11 .
During this period, we will leave our homes and work for Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan
Whether it is a house or a street, a square or a square or a nalia, a school, a college and all public places have to undertake a great campaign of cleanliness.
Similarly, we have to work together to eliminate the use of Single House plastic.
This will save money and will also contribute to protecting the environment.
On 2nd October, when we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate him to Open Defecation Free India but also lay the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal when all these plastic wastes are collected.
It can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus, by Diwali, we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is in a way a gem of knowledge.
We can get what we want in life .
These days , my contacts have been very low , but I had a lot of contact before .
Stupid people call stone stone gems
There is a lot of glory in our culture
Until We converted the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the POSHAN Abhiyaan, nutrition is being made a mass movement across the country through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought to my notice
Inside Nashik , a handful of paddy has become a big movement .
In this , in the days of harvesting , Anganwadi workers collect a handful of grains from the people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor in it becomes a sort of aware citizen social worker .
After that he himself becomes a soldier of that movement .
All of us have heard about the food processing in every corner of India in our families.
This is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Liquid do not fod
In 2010, Gujarat thought that children should be given a complimentary fodder on the occasion of Anna Prasan Sanskar so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a great initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states people run date meal campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, if there is a birthday or a memorial day then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food and go to schools and the family members serve and feed themselves.
They also share their joy and reflect in happiness .
A wonderful union of service and joy is seen .
Friends, there are so many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition effectively.
Today, in the absence of awareness, both poor and prosperous families are affected by malnutrition.
September 2018 to be celebrated as POSHAN Abhiyaan across the country
You must join it, get information, add something new. You also contribute.
If you bring one person out of malnutrition , we bring the country out of malnutrition .
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions about this and that too. And in the last few weeks, wherever I have met people, there is a mention of Man vs.
With this expedition, I have not only joined the youth of India but also the youth of the world. I had never imagined that this kind of place would become my place in the young hearts.
I had never imagined how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to .
I had never imagined that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the heart of the youth of the world .
And what happens 
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that since I got the opportunity to go wherever I got the opportunity to go as the Prime Minister, the situation has become due to International Yoga Day that if I go to someone in the world, then some or the other five-seven minutes, I only ask questions about Yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not discussed Yoga with me and I have experienced it all over the world.
But these days there ' s a new experience
Whatever you get, wherever you get a chance to talk, they talk about Wildlife and discuss about environment.
Tiger, ion, creatures, and I'm surprised how people are interested.
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their language.
I hope that in such a scenario, this episode of Discovery Channel will be very helpful in introducing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in India's ritual journey. And now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
But another interesting thing is that some people ask me a thing with hesitation that Modi ji was speaking Hindi and if you don't know Bear Grylls Hindi then how could it be so fast
What's this done later
It's been shouting so frequently. What has happened
ask with great curiosity
Look, there's no secret in it
Reality is that technology has been used a lot in talks with Bear Grylls.
So I used to speak Hindi but it used to be heard in English and due to that the dialogue became very easy and this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit the places related to nature and living organisms.
I have said before, I must say that you must go to North-East in your life.
will expand within you .
A country full of diversity will also fill you with these diversities as a teacher, you too, with diversity.
Last month I had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India 
Tiger population in India is 2967
A few years ago half of it was harder than we
Tiger summit took place in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010 about tigers
It took a resolution expressing concern about the decreasing number of tigers in the world.
This was the resolve to double the number of tigers all over the world by Twenty Two 2022.
We doubled our number of tigers in 2019 itself .
Not only the number of tigers in India but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the habitat of lions was shrinking in the jungles of Gir.
their numbers were decreasing .
We took several steps after one in Geer .
Decided to deploy women guards there in 2007
Improve infrastructure to boost tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk only about conservation.
But, now we have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion.
And in our scriptures there has been a good guidance .
Therefore, we need to not only preserve our forests, vegetation and wildlife, but also create an environment so that they can flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekanand Ji on 11th September, 1893 eighten ninety three
This young sannyasin of India, who shaken the human race all over the world, has left a stunning identity of India in the world.
The words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 forced the world to change the vision of seeing the world towards India.
Come, Swami Vivekanand Ji had seen the form of an India that Swami Vivekanand Ji had to know about the strength of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
This will be a big interesting campaign for everyone, children, elderly, youth and women and it will be your own.
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today
I want to make you aware of fitness and we will set some goals for the country for Fit India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on 29th August at It India.
Let us move with a new zeal, a new resolve, a new strength
My dear countrymen, today we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll wait for your point of view, your suggestions.
Let us all come together to realize Gandhi's dreams of making India the dreams of freedom fighters: Sukhay:
Let ' s express the inner joy with service .
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On 26th January, our Republic Day, we all celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way, is also a celebration that also makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, in our country, the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens - the depth of debate that should be debated, the widespread discussion that should be discussed is not happening yet.
I hope that at every level, every time, the strength that is given on rights, the same strength should be laid on duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties, India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the holy date of our revered Bapu.
On January 30, we pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping quiet for 11 o'clock in the morning, 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, 2 minute homage at 30 January 11 o'clock, this should be a comfortable nature.
Why not be 2 minutes, but there is also collectivity, resolution and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army, for the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honored with various gallantry awards.
In these awards, Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal are many categories.
We are surprised, proud and inspired when we know deeply about their courage, bravery and valour.
On the one hand, we were all happy with the news of the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of 26th January, at the same time, our army personnel in Kashmir who were engaged in protecting the country were brave due to avalanches.
I pay my homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I continue to talk about mind.
January, February, March, April - All these months are the months of criterion in every family.
Half of the households have an exam for two children, but the entire family is buried under the burden of exams.
So I was convinced that this is the right time to talk to students friends, talk to their applicants, talk to their teachers, because for many years, wherever I went, the examination was a big problem.
The family is disturbed, the student is upset, the teacher is upset, a very strange psychological environment is seen in every household.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to young friends in detail in some detail.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you if this atmosphere can't be pleasant
Well, the question has been asked by the universe, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
It has worked hard throughout the year, there has been an opportunity to tell, this should be a festival of enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom there is pleasure in the exam, eam is a pressure for most people.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pressure.
Anyone who believes in the pleasure will be able to regret the pressurrection.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when there is a festival, when there is a festival then the best thing that happens within us comes out.
The strength of the society is also at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
There should also be an atmosphere of festivals in the entire family, among friends and neighbours.
You see, this will be converted into a pressure, place.
The festive atmosphere will make the burden free.
And I urge parents to create an environment for these three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months of examinations are conducted.
It is the responsibility of all of us to change these three-four months every year in our own way, by taking our traditions, by taking the environment of our families into the festival.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smiling, you find relaxation and you easily relax and when you relax, you can easily recall your years old things too.
A year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom, the whole scene is remembered.
And you must know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you're in tension, then all the doors are closed, don't go out, don't come out.
There is a stoppage in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
You were the one who didn't tell me.
But whoever was inside came out immediately and came out because you relaxed.
And that is why if there is one of the biggest medicines to recall memory then it is relaxation.
And I tell my self-confidence that if there is a pressure then we forget our things and if we are relaxed then we cannot imagine it. Suddenly such things are remembered and they are very useful.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets suppressed and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is essential that A Chapy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we are unable to see the examination in the super specialty.
It seems that it is a question of life and death.
The exam that you are going to give is the exam of your studies throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you are living, what kind of life you want to lead, what kind of life you want to lead.
In your lives, in the classrooms, in the notebooks and exams, there must have been opportunities to go through several tests.
Therefore, the examination has something to do with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burden.
They went to the Air Force to join, fail.
Suppose if he was disappointed because of that failure, he would lose his life, would India get such a big scientist, would he not get such a big president
Points have become the most important.
Because of this, competition has increased a lot, along with tension in students has also increased a lot.
I would like to be aware of your views on this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has given the answer, but Chaji wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets have a limited use.
Nothing happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have acquired.
Life goes on to know what you have tried to live.
Is it life that you have got a sense of mission and that which is your sense of familiarity, is there any coordination between your mission and ambition
If you rely on these things, you will come after you asking the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
Your knowledge is going to be useful in life, skills are going to be used, self-confidence is going to work, your determination is going to be useful.
You tell me that there will be a doctor of your family and all the family members will go to him and they will have a family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks-sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge, his journey of success.
And that is why the burden of this issue sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I say that it is not just reading.
You must use it for your criterion.
I was yesterday, where I am today, it is necessary to know.
But if you focus on the marks, if you focus on the marks then you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area and get the marks only.
It may be that in spite of being promising in the exam, sometimes they fail in life.
Cha ji, one thing has also been said about the competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Most of the successful players have a special feature of life that they compete.
If we take the example of Shri Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years continuously breaking their own records, defeating themselves every time and moving forward.
He is a great journey of life, because he adopted the path of more competition than competition.
Friends in every sphere of life and when you are going to give an exam then if you were able to read it for two hours in peace, can you do it for three hours
From within itself that energy is produced automatically.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with great confidence.
If you make a mistake against him, you will be distressed and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy, which will feed yourself, and if you are equal then you will never feel the need for reforms.
Just concentrate on what I have done before, how I will do better than what I have done.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read and written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you learn to accept, the maximum problem will end.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the state, it gives an opportunity to open new avenues and therefore accept whatever is there.
You will also be burdened.
One of our acquaintances was in hospital due to heart attack, so before our Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also a MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that they did not come and ask a single question about their health.
As soon as they sat there, what is the situation, what is the disease, no talk, started joking, and in the first two-four minutes, they lightened such an environment.
In a way, going to the sick person as we scare the disease.
I would like to say to parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought that in the days of DEAM, there should be an atmosphere of laughter for the children.
You see, the environment will change.
A wonderful phone call has come to me.
They do not want to tell the gentleman their name.
On hearing the phone, you will know why they don't want to mention their name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
I tried to mimic my childhood once, I started preparing a lot for it and tried to find out how I could mimic it, due to which a lot of time was wasted.
I could bring the same number by reading that time as much as I spent on imitating it.
And when I tried to pass by copying, I was caught in it and because of me many friends around me got a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut routes become the reason for imitating them.
So Copy never makes profits.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard many times and again that do not copy, do not copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once the habit of duplication has taken place, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
If you give the same creativity on the issues of your exam, perhaps there is no need for imitation.
The results that will be achieved by the hard work of yourself, the confidence that will increase will be amazing.
This basic assumption is wrong, it is the root cause of the problem.
If there is a holistic development then there is a life outside the books and it is very huge.
This is the time to learn to live.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later, I will do this later, then it is impossible.
Have you ever imagined that when all this is happening in front of you, then go out for two moments and look at the sky, look at the trees and plants, lighten a little bit of your mind, you see, with a freshness, you will again come in your room, in your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, get out and go to the kitchen, there is something of your choice, if you find a biscuit of your choice, then eat, make fun of it.
Even if you don't have five minutes, but give me a break.
You will feel that your work is getting easier.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to breathe deeply.
If you come under the open sky, if you go to the ceiling, if you sit for five minutes with a deep breath, then you will see that the body will be relaxed and the relaxation of the body that you feel, it will also relax the brain organs.
When I hold meetings in elections, sometimes my voice sat down.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No, no, say - This is your voice that gets disturbed by speaking at the time of election, it is related to it.
If you take full sleep then only your vocal cord will get a complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleeping and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the significance of these things, you see, you will benefit.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but something will say that the Prime Minister has said that now there is no need to wake up, sleeping.
So do not do this, otherwise your family members will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on the day you will not show them, I will show them.
So do not do that.
And that is why I would say that P for prepared and P for play, the person who plays, the shines, this is a very big medicine to keep mind, intelligence and body alert.
Well, young friends, you are in the process of examining and I am holding you in the matter of mind.
Maybe these things will also work for you in relaxation.
If you can, do it, if you can not, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So as I advise the parents of your family not to be burdened, they apply to me too.
Make the criterion festival to cross every criterion.
Then there will be no criterion, criterion.
Please move ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has maintained its place among the world's 4 largest Coast Guards with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
While fulfilling this motto, the youngsters of the Coast Guard are eager to be prepared day and night in adverse conditions to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, women are also equally responsible and successfully playing their own responsibilities.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard be Pilot, be it working as bservers or be it overcraft.
It is considered an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color gives Basanti Chola - this is the same inspiration.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious festival of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio always fills new colors with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started talking about the mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
It has got comprehensive approval.
People from far away are writing letters.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to join you.
My best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
However, you must have seen in the newspapers, new people are getting caught every day, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught.

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border with the soldiers to celebrate Diwali, on the border of China.
I go every time, but this Diwali experience was something else.
25 billion countrymen, in a unique way, dedicated this Diwali to the army personnel, dedicated it to the security forces, its impact was expressed on the faces of every soldier.
They looked filled with emotions and not only this, the good wishes sent by the countrymen, the security forces of the country were included in their happiness, there was a wonderful response.
And people sent messengers only, not so, they had joined their hearts.
Someone wrote a poem, someone made a picture, someone made a cartoon, someone made a video, that is, every house had become a chawki like fighters.
The work is going on, with your contribution, the feelings of the army personnel of the country will be compiled in this book with your imagination and your feelings towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier wrote to me - Prime Minister, for the soldiers, every festival of Holi and Diwali is held on the border, all the time the country remains under the protection of the country.
Yes, still the house is remembered during festivals
But to be honest, this time it didn't happen
It's not like the festival and I'm not home.
It felt as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians
My dear countrymen, the feeling that this Diwali, the feeling that has awakened among the security forces of our country, should it be confined only on some occasions
I appeal to you that as a society, as a nation, as a nation, be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival of joy or be it an atmosphere of joy, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other.
When the whole nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Just a while ago, I had come to Jammu and Kashmir to meet all the heads of the village there.
I had the opportunity to talk to him for a long time
They had come here with some things about the development of their village, they had come here with some demands, but when the talk was going on, it was natural to see the situation in the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were very natural.
And so lovingly, with so much openness, these village heads spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I had urged them to go and focus on the future of these children
Today, I am happy that all these Prime Ministers from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me.
Going to the village awakened all the distant people
Just a few days ago, when board exams were held, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board examination of about 95 students of Pachanbe-Fee-Kashmir.
The inclusion of students in such large numbers in board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm, but I heartily congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I ask for suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that all suggestions come together.
Everyone used to say that talk more in detail on notes of 500- and 1000-
While addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, I had talked about initiating a grand campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I also realized that we will have to face many new difficulties in our normal life
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards a normal state.
The campaign to get rid of the diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years cannot be simplified
I can understand your difficulties very well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
Despite several efforts being made to mislead you, sometimes you have understood this path of truth and you have accepted this thing of national interest very well.
Five hundred thousand notes and such a large country, such a huge currency notes, billions and billions of notes and these decisions - the entire world is looking at them very closely, every economist is analysing it and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that the 1. 25 billion Indians will succeed even after facing difficulties.
There may be a question mark in the mind of the world
India has faith in the 1. 25 billion Indians, it is a belief that 1. 25 billion Indians will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country will emerge from the heat of gold in every way and the reason for it is the citizens of this country, you people are the reason for it. You have also been able to find the way for this success.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of tensions, all these people are working very quietly, as a sacrifice for the service of the nation and as an attempt to bring about a great transformation.
Start in the morning, when the night will be complete, don't even know, but all are
And that is why India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an elderly man in Khandwa was admitted.
Suddenly money was needed
I was glad to know that they provided money to the elderly by visiting their own house so that they could help in the treatment.
Such countless stories emerge every day in TV, in media, in newspapers, in conversations.
His ability was introduced
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective strength of everyone, will enhance this nation by making it a new strength.
But the evils are so widespread that even today some people do not have the habit of evil .
Still, some people feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, this anonymous money, and some other way I will bring it back to the system.
They are looking for unlawful ways to save their money
Sadly , they have chosen the way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
But, by kindness, do not play with the lives of the poor
Do not do anything that brings the name of the poor to the record and when it is tested later, my beloved poor will be in trouble because of your sin.
And there is such a harsh law of Anonymous property that is being implemented in it, how difficult it will be
And the government does not want our countrymen to face any difficulty
Any Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has telephoned me for the fight against corruption and black money through this five hundred and thousand: - Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Village Tirli, Tehsil Tirli, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that the currency that you have closed notes of thousands and five hundred
Just like that, I got a phone call from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I want to thank you very much because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all this, taught a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have a good day
That ' s why I want to thank you heartily .
Some things get to know through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm to work is also greater.
It is so enjoyable, so proud that what the common man has in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass through there again, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, which includes service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there is a marriage too.
I came to know that on 17th November at Surat, there was a marriage that took place with a discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, a daughter of Surat gave tea to those who had come to her marriage and did not have any water, no food programme, because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
Baratis also respected him so much
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - they have contributed to the fight against corruption, black money, and the fight that is going on through their marriage.
I also bless Navparineet Bharat and Daksha and congratulate you all for turning the occasion of marriage into a new occasion by converting it into a great sacrifice.
Tea-workers live and Tea-Worker gets money weekly.
Now a note of Rs 2000 was found, what did they do
Four neighbouring women gathered and the four went together and paid a note of Rs. 2000, so they did not need a small currency because the four together purchased and decided that they would meet next week, then we would take account of it.
People are searching for their own ways
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people of this campaign have got immediate benefits
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every munificiality is hardly 50 of tax .
But this time , on the 8th of this decision , everyone ran to deposit their old notes .
Last year 47 urban units had received tax of about Rs. 3,500 crore.
You will be surprised to know, you will be happy to know that in this week, they had deposited Rs 13,000 crore.
Said three-and-a-half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too came from the front
Now this money has come four times in those municipalities, it is natural that there will be provision of gutters in poor settlements, water arrangements and Anganwadi arrangements will be made.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are also being seen .
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong axis of our country's economy.
On the one hand, every citizen is adjusting himself because of this new change in the economy, in the midst of difficulties.
But I want to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking the statistics of sowing this crop
I am glad, be it wheat or pulses or oilseeds or till the 20th of November, sowing has increased substantially compared to last year.
Even in the midst of difficulties, the farmer has found ways
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have given priority
Even after that there are difficulties, but I am sure that the farmers who are facing all our difficulties, our natural obstacles always stand up and stand up to this time too.
Small traders of our country, they provide employment, they also increase economic activity.
Millions and millions of rupees were given to such small people by the money scheme because these small businesses, millions of people do it and they speed up the business of billions and billions of rupees.
But due to this decision , it was natural for them to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now even our small traders are serving the customers in their own way through technology, through mobile app, through mobile bank, through credit card, on the basis of faith.
And I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you too should enter the digital world.
You also download the bank ' s App on your mobile phone
You also have PSL machines for credit cards
I invite you that you can contribute a lot in making cashless society, you can create a complete banking system in increasing your business, on mobile phones and today there are many ways other than the notes that we can run the business.
There are technological ways, safe, secure and quick
I would like you not only to help in making this campaign a success but also to lead the change and I am sure you can lead the change.
I want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have been exploited very much.
There is a salary on paper and when given in hand, then there is another
Sometimes when the salary is met, someone stands outside, he has to cut and labour forcefully makes this exploitation a part of life.
With this new system, we want you to have an account in your bank and deposit your salary in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
And once you have got money in your bank account, you too dont need a big smart phone on a small mobile phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-box - you can also pay the same mobile phone whatever you want to buy in a small shop in the neighborhood.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourers to be a partner in this scheme because after all, I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the deprived and the deprived.
Today , I specially want to talk to young friends
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 population, less than 35 years of age.
You are the young men and women of my country, I know, my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you contribute a lot to advancing this positively .
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion
We have had a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India. There has been an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
You're not gonna talk to me.
The older generation does not have the experience of the world today.
Even the elder brother in your family will not know and parents, uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what happens, you know what happens, you know what happens online banking, you know how online ticket booking is done.
Things are very common to you and you use them too .
But today the country wants to do the great work, our dream is cashless society.
It is true that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I want your personal help in this thing, I need your time, I need a solemn pledge of myself and you will never disappoint me, I am sure, because we are all those who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, how many opportunities are today for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking
Every bank offers online facility
Wallet means e-butwa
There are many types of cards available
The ordinary featured phone can also cause cash transfer.
Whether it is a washerman, a seller of vegetables, a seller of milk, a seller of newspapers, a seller of tea or a seller of gram, everyone can comfortably use it.
And I have also emphasized to make this system easier
All the banks are engaged on it,
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation who is unfamiliar with it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great task.
The kind of creative message you give on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and jokes - I see all these things and the creative power of our younger generation among the challenges, it looks as if it is the characteristic of the Indian soil that the Gita was born in the battlefield in a time when we are passing through such a period of change then the original creativity is being manifested in you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, I believe that millions of youth of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business 
You can voluntarily bring this cashless society out of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from difficulties and problems - you have to lead it.
Once you will teach people how to use Rupay cards, the poor will bless you.
If you teach the ordinary citizen these facilities then he will perhaps get rid of all these concerns. And if all the youth of India take this task then I dont believe that it will take a long time.
Within a month, we can stand in the form of a new modern India within the world and you can do this thing through your mobile phone, you can do it by visiting 10 houses per day and adding 10 houses per day to it.
This country has made a big revolution
My young men, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward with great urgency.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is carrying forward the cleanliness drive.
It seems that the theme of cleanliness has spread to their veins and that is why they remembered the work of cleanliness even on the birth anniversary of their father.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of soil tan, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through this.
My introduction to soil stem, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction to his son, Shriman Amitabh ji, whose veins are running a mission of cleanliness, he has written to me using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My introduction
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh Rai Ji.
I would also like to thank Shri Amitabh ji for this kind of involvement in the matter of mind and for furthering the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your emotions keep me connected to you through your letters, on MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that for 365 days, in some corner of the country, a festival is seen.
The person who sees from a distance will feel that like the Indian public life, this is the second name of the festival, and this is also natural.
The festivals that have traditionally been in India since the Vedic times have been a time-bound celebration, we have dared to end the tradition of external festivals and the changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the demands of time and society.
But one of these things can be seen very well that this journey of India's festivals, its expansion, its depth, its penetration among the masses, its penetration and its original mantra are connected to the world.
Efforts should be made to expand the individual and personality, to expand the scope of our limited thinking, from society to universe and through these festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have embraced the festival in a scientific manner.
Today the whole world discusses the environment.
Nature-Destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been a tradition that has made nature-loving strong, it has been ritualizing every person from child to child.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's responsibility is being celebrated.
Nowadays we celebrate holidays on Sunday, but the older generation, the wage earners, the fishermen, you must have seen that for centuries our tradition was to celebrate the festival of Purnima and Amavasya.
That is, we have developed a tradition of celebrating holidays with universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is an educational festival, it brings about the realization of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya - from darkness to light.
By burning the lamp of Deepawali, the darkness that is darkened in the form of society, the darkness that is darkened in the form of individual faults, liberation from the darkness of the individual and that is the festival of lighting the lamps of Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, let us go to any corner of India, let us go to the house of the richest of the poor, let us go to the hut of the poorest of the poor, we can see the campaign of cleanliness in every family in the festival of Diwali.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If the poor will have pottery of their soil, they also clean the pottery as if it has just come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness drive.
But, the need of the hour is not just cleanliness in the house, cleanliness of the entire complex, cleanliness of the entire village, we have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other.
Many governments of the world, parliament and rulers of that place are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
And they have shared that picture with the world and have done it with great pride.
And what is the picture
16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and this photo has become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had just come, he told me that I have to go back so soon that I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
Gathering many firecrackers invites a very big accident in an attempt to make a big voice.
Sometimes it does not even notice what are the things around, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, the news of the accident, the news of the fire, the news of the dysfunction, gives great concern.
And a problem also arises that in the days of Diwali, doctors have gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers and a crisis is added to the crisis.
It is not just one day.
Say that Govardhan Puja, brother Duj, say Benefit Panchami, and take it to the light festival of Kartik Purnima, in a way a long period goes on.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern region of India.
In a way there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but it has a special feature - it gives a very deep message to the society.
But the saying is that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
Let me talk about the festival of Deepawali, let us talk about Chhath Puja - this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you but at the same time there is more time for me, especially to thank the countrymen, to express my gratitude.
For the past few months, the events that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness.
My feelings and feelings are shadowed by the soldiers of the army, the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work, my heart and mind.
And one of the things was done in the mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down my head and say that there will not be any human being in India whose heart there is immense love for the soldiers of the country, there is pride in the army and pride in the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine the security forces, we cannot imagine such a courageous person, your message has emerged as a force.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons or cinema, there is hardly any one left who has not burnt or burnt for the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed the occasion of expressing gratitude to the army, be it BSF, CRPF or ICAI.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Jal Sena, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, I cannot speak the names of all.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is a new strength in that memory too.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country has shown tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers, all these things have come upon this washtag in a symbolic manner.
I have sent a poem by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, it is all, because you are, this is because I tell you today, the reason for my freedom is you, the cause of my happiness, I sleep peacefully, because I sleep peacefully, because you are stationed on the outskirts, because you are on the outskirts of the mountain Amber and India's bowing heads to you, the Mount Ambar and the army of India bowing heads to you, the army of India are mine as well.
My dear countrymen, whose maternal uncle is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, such a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Let us hear what the army family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign launched on this Deepawali.
I'm from an Army family.
My husband is also Army Officer.
Both my father and father-in-law have been Army officers.
So, our entire family is full of souldiers and we have several such officers on the border who are receiving so many good messages and are getting a lot of incentives.
And I would like to say that along with Army Officers and Soldiers, their families and their wives also make a lot of sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the army personnel are found standing not only on the border but on every front of their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from defecation in the open.
Earlier Sikkim had been the province, now Himachal too has happened, Kerala is also going to be there on 1st November.
Shri Vikas Thakur, a TBP trooper, originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So at that time he was going to have a village council in the village, he reached there and was discussing in the meeting of the village, constructing toilets and it was found that some families were unable to make toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is a patriotism filled with patriotism.
Only then did Himachal Pradesh have the power to free itspen execution.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
I noticed that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no road, after walking on foot all day, it is very difficult to reach that village.
People never go
Near it, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets were to be constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS people, students of engineering together decided that we will build toilets.
All the goods that were required to be taken to construct toilets, bricks, cement, all these youths took up their shoulders and went to those jungles walking all day long.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken up this task, the entire state, I am sure that the carrosene will be free soon.
What a big change will be brought about, theft will also stop, the environment will also benefit, our foreign exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, if it's a problem, the middlemen will be, the dishonest.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them still decides the standard for the country, how to go.
You decide on the basis of this standard.
The need of the hour is to address the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the troubles.
Whatever our old thinking may be, but society must be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools and toilets for children too.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel discrimination-free India.
Though vaccination takes place on behalf of the government, but even then lakhs of children get rid of vaccination and become victims of disease.
Mission Indradhanush is a campaign of immunization, which is also engaged in absorbing the missing children, which empowers children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the health of the poor mothers and sisters by cooking food on a wooden stove and taking 400 cigarettes of smoke in their body
The effort is to provide a life free of smoke to 5 crore families, we are moving forward towards success.
The small trader, the small businessman, the seller of the vegetable, the seller of the milk, the barber who runs the shop, the moneylenders used to get stuck in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, Account, this is a successful campaign to get rid of the interest-seekers.
The beneficiary will receive money directly from the bank through Aadhaar.
This is an opportunity to get rid of middlemen in the lives of common man.
There is a campaign to run, in which there is no improvement and change, the path to liberation from the problem is to be ensured and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the great personality of this country, who made the mantra of his life, who demonstrated his life.
But the phone of a gentleman of Punjab, his pain, touched me too: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, on 31st, Sardar Patel ji has a birthday.
And as we all know how the events have taken place in the country after their assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we stop those unfortunate events that take place
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the Bhagirath work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
A successful effort to bring India under one flag, a great Bhagirath, a great man who did such a great job, bowed down to that great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, because of his priorities of unity struggled for unity, he was also a victim of anger, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for the sake of unity and on the birthday of Sardar, a page of oppression, history hurts us all.
However, in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
We should also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendency, save the country too.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, it is the responsibility of all of us to make the best India.
The basic mantra of unity makes the strong foundation of the best India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb's life began with the struggle of the farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful efforts to make the freedom movement a force in the village was the result of his organisational strength and skills.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not so, he was also a person of the structure.
Today sometimes we hear the name of Amul.
Today people are familiar with every product of Amul even outside India and India.
However, very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine vision that he had imagined the unity of cooperative milk products.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light festival in the series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev, his educational initiation is still a guide for the entire human race, not only for India, but for the entire human race.
Service, truth and Sarbat da Bhala, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill were the only mantras.
Be it discrimination, be it superstitions or be it evils, the campaign to liberate the society was in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his ally when we had an untouchable, caste system, high and low on the extreme limit of its deformity.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to discriminate, who orders us to do something against discrimination, who can be our guide better than Guru Nanak Dev by taking this mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas
I salute Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolves are successful in every way.
I wish you all the very best in your lives.
Thank you very much.
In the past, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I bow down to all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I would like to tell the countrymen this thing today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day that the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
I would like to especially talk to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the anti-national forces well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have separated themselves from such elements and followed the path of peace.
Every parents wish that the school-college should work completely as soon as possible.
The farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. are ready to reach the market across the country.
Economic business also runs well.
And for the last few days, the business has started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of our problems, the path of our progress and the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem, find ways and also pav the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to make laws and orders.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think are new ideas.
I get a lot of opportunity to know these days in social media.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people and it promotes the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th grade put a different kind of thought in front of me.
He wrote that I was very distracted after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there was no way to do it and what could a small student like me do
So I came to my mind how to work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I will study 3 hours a day.
The country's work can come, it will be such a worthy citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of happiness for me that you can imagine healthily at such a young age in this atmosphere of anger.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried his best to touch this world of emotions in a very good manner.
And he inspired the common man of the country by giving a mantra of Jai Jawan- Jai Kisan.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had presented another way of expressing patriotism in the midst of the sound of a bomb.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the freedom movement, when the movement was on intensity and there was a need for a stop in the movement, he used to do great success in motivating that intensity of movement towards constructive work within the society.
All of us should take up our responsibility, should the people sitting in the government perform their duty. And if we make a constructive contribution with the zeal of our countrymen, every citizen, with the strength of this patriotism, then the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on NarendraModiApp that the athletes who had gone to Paralympics had created history and their performance was the victory of human spirit.
Varun Viswanathan also wrote on the NarendraModiApp that our athletes have done a very good job and you should mention it in the matter of mind.
You two, every individual of the country has an emotional attachment towards our sportspersons in Paralympics.
Perhaps more than sports, this Paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the perspective of humanity, the approach towards Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is a lot of power in this sentence.
This time 19 athletes, including three women from our country, participated in the Paralympics.
In comparison to other sports, when Divyang plays, physical capabilities, sports skills are the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals while performing the best so far - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medal.
Bhai Devendra Ji, who received the Gold Medal, brought the gold medal again in Jhajria and Bhala and brought it again after 12 years.
And they were not Divya from birth.
They had to lose their hands because of the electric current.
Just imagine, the person who attains the first gold medal at the age of 23 years and at the age of 35 years gets the second gold medal, how much he has done in his life
Mariyappan won the gold medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of 5.
The poor also did not come against their resolve.
Neither are they from the big city nor are they from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country was given a medal with the ability to resolve.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, it has been associated with her name to hoist several types of Vijayapatakyas.
Varun C. Bhati got a bronze medal in a high jump.
In our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in our neighborhood, these medals have done a great job to look at the divyang brothers and sisters.
Our feelings have awakened, but the attitude of looking at these people with disabilities has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of the kind of valour that these disabled persons have done in the Paralympics this time.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition at the same place.
Someone can imagine that the people of Divyang also broke the record of General Olympics.
This time it has happened.
Abdellati Baka of Algeria has made a new record in the race for Divyang by the record that was made by the gold medal winner in the 1500 meter race in which the Lympics competition was held.
Not only this, I was surprised that the number of persons with disabilities who got the fourth number as a runner, who did not get any medal, had run in less time than the person who got the gold medal in general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the days to come, India is moving forward in the direction of making a smooth plan for Paralympics as well as for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
He told me some portions, and I presented them to the people, so people were surprised.
On that day, I had the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected successful stories of the lives of a few persons with disabilities.
There were big motivational events.
The Government of India recorded the world on the soil of Navsari, which I believe is important.
Within eight hours, six or six persons with disabilities, who could not hear, were successfully used to feed machines to listen to them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for us to have three world records by the Divyang people in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, it should become a duty of every citizen, an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt should be created.
Now, when two years are taking place on 2nd October, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step.
It means that the country has moved forward towards cleanliness.
It has also been confirmed, the direction is correct, the fruits are so good, they have also seen what happens with a little effort. Therefore, everybody should be a common citizen, be it an ordinary citizen, be it the government offices or roads, be it railways or railways, be it schools or colleges, be it religious places, be it hospitals, be it children or the elderly, the rural poor, the farmers women, all are contributing to cleanliness.
Media's friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, the efforts have been immense, and we will succeed, this belief has also arisen.
If we talk about rural India then so far 2 crore forty-two lakh toilets have been constructed and 1. 5 crore more toilets have been constructed in the next one year.
When I had gone to Gujarat, I was told by the officials that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove to be a complete goal on 2nd October.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, best wishes to those who are trying to do this thing and I urge the countrymen that we have to free the country from this problem for respecting mothers and sisters and for the health of small children.
I specially want to present a scheme for young friends who use technology in a big way.
Everyone has the right to know what the cleanliness mission is in your city and for this the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know, Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
These 1969 numbers - You will not only be able to know the condition of construction of toilets in your city by phone but also apply for toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the Corporate World to come forward.
Those who want to work for cleanliness should sponsor such young professionals.
They can be sent to the districts in the form of Swachh Bharat Fellows.
This cleanliness drive is not just a matter of being limited to rituals.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, along with sanitation, revenue model is also essential.
Haste to Health is also a part of it. Therefore, we have to move ahead with the Swachhta Mission as well as towards waste to compost.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost they prepare from the waste.
Provide these to the farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the earth, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, they should be provided with such fertilizers in some quantities.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this work as Brand Ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors of metropolitan cities and commissioners from all over the country are going to concentrate on cleanliness and cleanliness alone.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I see that there are new news about cleanliness continuously.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a Jagaran campaign to construct toilets.
He himself laboured and contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that a team led by Hing Commander Param Vir Singh had travelled 2800 kilometers from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a one year calendar by its departments.
Every department focuses on cleanliness for 15 days, especially for cleanliness.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, the three of them will work together to create a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two week of the month of October, from October 16th to October 31st, three more departments of agriculture and farmer area - Department of Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries.
My citizens are also requested that if you have any connection in the work done by these departments then you should also join.
You must have seen that a survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on these days.
Earlier, what was the situation of cleanliness by surveilling 73 cities was presented to the people of the country.
Now there is a turn of 500 people who have more than 1 lakh people and because of this there is a belief in every city that we are left behind, we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of cleanliness competition.
I hope that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in this campaign.
The next 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is taking two years.
I have been urging Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time also I urge that every family should have something of Khadi so that the people of the poor can get the burning of Diwali in their houses.
On October 2, while Sunday, as a citizen, can we join ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
And I would like to tell you that you should share a photo of the cleanliness drive that you are involved in, on NarendraModiApp.
If you are video, share video.
Look, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new pace with the efforts of our people all over the country.
Recalling the virtue of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in yourself to give it in life, no one should recognise it or not.
It is his campaign to collect food items, clothes and all these things to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and they used to donate the old toys with their families and the toys that used to come would offer gifts in the Anganwadi of the poor settlement.
This is a kind of Dan festival.
I convey my best wishes to the youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji is being celebrated today and the centenary year of his birth is being celebrated from today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitay-Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya - this is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can a poor person get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire economic agenda to every farm in two words.
The country celebrated their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
How the benefits of society, governments, everyones attention and development should be focused on the poor and only then can we deliver the country from poverty.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the same century.
Inspired by all of us, I respectfully bow down to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, the wealthy devotee of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, I had started talking about Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijaya Dashami.
It was my authentic endeavour that Mann Ki Baat should not be a program to praise government works.
How the common man of this country inspires me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which you have praised Mann Ki Baat, the way you have blessed me, when I complete two years this week.
I am also grateful to All India Radio that they not only broadcast these things to me but also made every effort to reach them in all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who by writing letters, suggesting, knocking the doors of the government, highlighting the shortcomings of the government. And All India Radio has provided platforms for solving problems by organizing special programmes on such letters.
So the matter of mind is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it has become a new opportunity for social change.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja next week, the festival of Vijaya Dashami, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way, a similar atmosphere is present throughout the country.
This is the festival of Shakti-Upasana, the unity of the society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can it be a festival of worship of Shakti, worship of unity of society
How to make a festival connecting the people
And that should be the sadhana of true power and only then can we celebrate the victory of tax together.
Come, do the sadhana of power, let us take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on August 29, the magician of Hockey Dhyan Chand ji is the birth date.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I would like to remind all of you of his contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in giving India the gold medal of the Hockey hockey hockey.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji - We Scores goals like runs, Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player shot hockey on the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
There was only 10 minutes left to complete the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury with a round.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is time to talk about Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
It is a very positive feeling for a common citizen to have so much attachment to Rio Elympics, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it.
Outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, it also became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
Please talk about daughters education and their participation in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
Some Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of this time's mind.
The medals we received, the daughters gave.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems as if the daughters of entire India have taken the lead in illuminating the country's name.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do even better in lympics.
He has written honorable Modi sir, congratulations for the two medals we won in Rio first.
But I want to draw your attention on whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need a long journey in sports.
Our parents still emphasize on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports is still considered a waste of time in society.
We need to change this thinking.
The society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Similarly, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on NarendraModiApp that there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities, especially children and youth by taking sports.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling in a way.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform according to our hopes.
In some cases it also happened that those players who used to perform in India, those who used to perform in the sports here did not even reach there and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, for the first time in many subjects, Indian players have shown a lot of good work.
Now, within the shooting, our innovative Bindra ji stayed in fourth place and he missed the medal with a very small difference.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar also did wonder - she remained in fourth place, she missed the medal due to a very small difference.
But how can we forget one thing that she is the first Indian daughter to qualify for lympics and for lympic finals
Something similar happened in Tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
We performed well this time in the athletics.
After P. T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar had qualifyed for the track field finals.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached the lympics.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached Curter-inal in Boing, but could not find Bronze.
Many players, such as Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do the same thing, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a commitment.
The government of India will go into its depths and study what kind of practices are being done in the world.
We will create a roadmap for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a far-reaching thinking.
I also urge the state governments to make such committees and what we can do within the sports world, what each state can do, what the state likes to play one or two games.
And I urge every citizen of India to send suggestions on NarendraModiApp to those who are interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss the association and give its memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss their suggestions and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I used to learn a lot from these small boys too.
For me, it was also 5th September Teachers Day and for me, it was also Education Day.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Summit so I felt that today I can express this feeling in the matter of my heart.
The place of mother in life is as much as the teacher's place.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand ji is discussed around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher than a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of my students.
Teacher's contribution in our lives is always felt.
5th September is the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former President of India and the country celebrates it as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think that I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our ero in our small village.
But today I can say with joy that a teacher of mine is now 90 years old - his letter comes to me every month.
And I am surprised that even at the age of 90, he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad. And whenever I see someone's good letters then I feel very much respected.
You are on NarendraModiApp, Photo with your teacher, any incident with your teacher, any motivation for your teacher, you must share it.
Look, it is also very valuable in itself to see the contribution of a teacher in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disintegrator and we all want our country, our society, our family, every individual and his life to remain uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav - this is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Utsav, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening and made a festival of social rites.
And, through public Ganesh Utsav, there is a wide range of discussions on issues that touch socio-economic life and programmes are designed to give a new boost to the society.
Even today, not just Maharashtra but in every corner of India, public Ganesh festivals have started.
All the youngsters make a lot of preparations to do this, there is a lot of enthusiasm.
And some people have still made a lot of effort to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They hold discussions on public issues, essay competitions, Rangoli competitions.
They also highlight the issues that touch the society in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth right.
Suraj should be our priority, cannot we communicate with the public Ganesh Utsav on this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of the society.
The festival fills a new life in the life of a person and society.
Life is impossible without celebration, but it has to be molded as per the time requirement.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot about Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone has done Shree Shankar Narayana Pacific, he has urged people not to use the statues of Ganesh ji made of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of village ponds
The statues made of POP are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why not come back to our old tradition by using soil and statues of Ganesh, Durga.
It is the service of God that protects the environment, protects our rivers and ponds, protects the small creatures of this water from pollution.
Ganesh ji is a disintegrator
So we should not make such a Ganesh ji who creates disturbances.
I don't know how you will take these things.
Many such institutions and individuals work very hard for the soil of Ganesh.
Co-rendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we should decide that the sculptures that our old families used to build will also get employment and if they are made of pond or river soil then they will get it again and they will also protect the environment.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be honored with the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life in India to serve the poor.
When Mother Teresa receives the title of Saint, it is natural for all Indians to be proud.
On 4th September, an official delegation led by the Government of India, our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
From saints, sages, monks, great men we have to learn something or the other every moment.
We will continue to find something, keep learning and do something good.
My dear countrymen, what a big change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments in the past, has made a successful effort to connect people to clean Ganga, to clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, those people were invited to Allahabad who were the heads of the villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women were also.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of the Ganges coast took oath in the witness of Ma Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of open defecation in their villages of the Ganges coast, run a campaign to build toilets and the village will contribute completely in the cleaning of the Ganges. That the village will not allow the Ganges to be dirty.
I congratulate these Prime Ministers for coming to Allahabad for this solemn pledge, someone from Uttarakhand, someone from Uttar Pradesh, someone from Bihar, someone from Jharkhand, someone from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and the Ministers who have fulfilled this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a very important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding manpower.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch me a lot and I have a special respect for those who imagine it.
On July 15, in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh, more than a lakh students of more than seventeen hundred schools collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it had so much effect that it was an emotional impact that when the school came to school the next day after receiving the letter, the parents handed him a letter to Teacher and the parents had promised that he would make a toilet by the date of completion.
Congratulations to those who had come to this imagination and also to those students who made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who decided to take their child's letter seriously and make a toilet.
That's what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years of age in this district, she satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had left their food and that too was not for asking for anything for themselves, not for bringing good clothes, not for eating sweets, but for daughter Mallamma that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on id, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had done a satyagraha for toilet, then look at the specialty of the village's chief Mohammad Shafi that he had waited for eighteen thousand rupees and made an extra toilet within a week.
Look at the strength of this daughter Mallamma's insurgency and look at the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
How the paths are opened to solve the problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become determined.
Some Indians have made it their target.
But everyone is associated with it in some form, everyone is contributing to it.
It will be a competition and those who will be victorious on the 2nd of October Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can also make a film with your mobile phone camera.
Come, go ahead, you are my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, our relations should be smooth and our relations should be vibrant.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President Honourable Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata, All India Radio Friendship Channel.
Now many people will feel that the President should also inaugurate a radio channel
But this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here, All India Radio Friendship and Bangladesh Wireless, they will share content among themselves and the Bangla-speaking people will enjoy All India Radio on both sides.
All India Radio contributes immensely to People to People Contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of All India Radio that they are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of a Prime Minister but I am also a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a bit.
Such emotional events also give new energy, new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A mother, about 84, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
Had he not forbidden me to declare my name in his letter, I had a mind that today I should talk to you by giving him a name and he wrote a letter that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy, I had left the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
For me, the letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than a Padma Shri.
Friends, you would be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should go to Rubberu and give them a letter.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and she wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and that is why I am a retired teacher and in a few years it will be 90 years of age. I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that you can put such poor mothers in the work to free them from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine that as a normal teacher, a mother who walks on retired pension gives 50 thousand rupees to free mothers and sisters from stove smoke and gas connections.
The question is not about 50 thousand rupees, the question is of the feeling of that mother and such kind of mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes me confident and strong for the future of my country.
And he did not even write to me as the Prime Minister, he wrote a simple letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I salute that mother and I also salute these daughters of India who have been suffering themselves and always do something for the benefit of somebody.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled last year due to famine but this month of August was filled with the difficulties of floods.
There was frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central government, the local Swaraj organisations, the social institutions and the citizens have made every effort to do whatever they can.
However, among the news of these floods, there were reports that needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, if we come together, then how big can we get
This will be remembered in August this year.
In August 2016, a large number of political parties, non-existent parties against each other and nearly 90 parties across the country, a large number of parties and all the parties in the Parliament passed the GST law.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And if all the parties go together in one direction then this is an example of how big it is.
Similarly, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with one voice.
He also conveyed the message to the world, conveyed the message to the separatist elements and also expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all believe that everybody from the head of the village to the prime minister believes that if anyone knows about Kashmir, whether it belongs to a young man or a security personnel, it is ours, it belongs to ourselves, it belongs to ourselves.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to give greater strength to unity, highlight more and then make the country a bright future.
I have faith in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
That's all, thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the days to come, the color of sports throughout the country will give the youngsters the color of enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
We all know that within a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be the Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to resonate in our ears.
Our aspirations are very much, but the sportspersons who have been invited to play in Rio are also enthusiastic about 1. 25 billion Indians.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organized a very good event in Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khelo.
In the days to come, wherever we may be, do something to encourage our players.
Whatever is the hobby of eating, everything has to be left.
I am ready to do this work on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to become a postman to convey your message to these players.
If there are no research and innovation then just like the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to win the confidence of old technology without research and innovation, then we will become out of time in the changing era. And that is why the government has also taken several steps for the charm, research and innovation of science in the new generation.
And that is why I say - let us aim to innovate and when I say Let us aim to innovate, then my AIDS will be very good.
If we want to prepare the next generation innovators then our children will have to connect with them and that is why the government of India has taken the initiative of an Atal Tinkering Cabs.
Wherever there will be such a thinkering ab establishment in schools, Rs. 10 lakh will be given to them and Rs. 10 lakh will be given for maintenance in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre, we get a system for innovation, start-ups, to make use of it and to bring it to a position.
In the same way, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technological solutions.
We have called for an Atal Grand Challenges to the younger generation of the country to find solutions for technology, research and innovation.
The Government of India wants to give a special prize to the technology discovered to solve our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worried about famine and these days rains are also enjoying the news of floods.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to help the flood victims.
Because of the rains, every heart, every human mind gets overwhelmed because of the difficulties in which there is rainfall and cultivation in the center of our entire economic activity.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we regret lifelong.
Dengue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a little bit of hygiene, be a little cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and this is not the idea that such a disease occurs in a poor settlement and this is not the case of engagement.
Dengue comes first in a comfortable and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertisements on TV but sometimes we are a little indifferent about awareness about it.
The government, the hospital, the doctors, they will do their jobs but we too should not enter the engagement in our homes, in our homes, in our families and be cautious about the illness due to water.
My dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention towards another problem.
Life has become so impotent, it has become so racing that sometimes we dont have time to think for ourselves.
If he falls sick, he feels like healing quickly and hence someone puts antibiotics in his body.
Immediately we get rid of the disease, but my dear countrymen, these pathways can create a grave crisis in the habit of taking antibiotics.
You may be relieved for a few moments, but without the advice of doctors, we stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked you to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves at a rapid pace that medicines have no effect.
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of how to use antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
Our mothers in pregnancy are sometimes very worried about their lives.
About 30 million women in our country take pregnancy every year, but some mothers die during pregnancy, sometimes mother dies, sometimes a child dies, sometimes both a child and a mother die.
It is true that in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the rate of untimely death of the mother, but still a large amount of pregnant mothers can not save lives.
Deficiency of blood during or after pregnancy, infection related to childbirth, high BP - When does not know which problem destroy her life
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be checked free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved and I specially told the Gynecologist if you cannot serve the poor mothers free of cost on 9th of the month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not spend twelve days in a year for the poor
I am sure you will join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world - climate change, global warming, environment - is a big concern.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Lord Krishna also discusses the tree in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means that we can guess how much its importance will be.
Lord Krishna says in the Gita - Ashwatha: Sarvavrikshana i.e. I am a peepal in all the trees.
Venus has been stated in the policy - Nasti original Anushadhan - There is no such plant in which there is no medicinal properties.
He gives a wire to a tree in the world like a tree.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare plant good trees and follow them like their children.
Our scriptures, be it Venus or Venus or the Discipline Festival of the Mahabharata - but there are some people in today's generation who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came to my mind, she touched my heart.
In the Discipline Festival of the Mahabharata, the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in the world, Sonal has taken the lead not only in his parents but also in fulfilling the wishes of the society.
Farmer Khandu Maruti Mahatre of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, he married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
Sonal, who is an agricultural graduate, came to him and presented mango plants in marriage, see how beautiful the love of nature appeared.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of nature and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatre for this innovative endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pilgrims visiting the temple of Ambaji in the month of Bhadra, once a social worker organisation decided that those who would come to the temple would plant them in the offerings and would ask them that look, this is the offerings of Mother Mata ji, this plant should be made big by visiting their villages and mothers will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we waste our land by putting fences on the edge of our fields, why not we cultivate timber in the place of that fence.
Today, in order to make India a home, we have to bring billions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions from abroad.
If we plant such trees at the edge of our farms, which are used for urination and houses, then we can cut them off from the government's permission after fifteen-twenty years and they can also become a new source of income for you and you can also avoid importing timber to India.
In the past, many states have launched a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has passed an AMPLA law just now, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go for plantation.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half million saplings in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have resolved to plant three crore saplings.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert Festival - this is a big forest festival and we have resolved to plant twenty five lakh saplings.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know that they have taken such a big step.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover by Twenty Two-Nine (2029).
There is also a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has taken up a number of projects like Amra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest as a Van Mahotsav and has launched a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I am not able to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign tour then there is a diplomacy, there is talk of trade, there are discussions about security, there are several Moses - all this has to be done.
But for me the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Neelson Mandela.
When these words fall on the ears of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I had gone to Phoeni Setlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel in the train that Mahatma Gandhi had undertaken and the train that was launched to make a Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you, this time I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities who had spent their youth for equality, for equal opportunity and for the society.
He had fought with Nelson Mandela on his shoulder, he had lived with Nelson Mandela in prisons for twenty-twenty-two years.
In a way, he had sacrificed all his youth and I had the privilege of visiting these great personalities, Mr. Ahmad Kathara, a close associate of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bios, Ronnie Casrills.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they were ready to die for those who had won.
On their faces, even after doing such a great penance, it was not visible anywhere.
A kind of duties - the characteristics of duty that you have described in the Gita, they seem to be absolutely evident.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
This is the path that leads us towards a bright future.
Want a good future for children.
The priority will vary, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, of equality, of equality, of equality and of equality.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have shown the original mantras of our lives in South Africa as well.
Being a woman, I'm sorry for her family.
And just as technology is playing a very big role in the economic system, its misusers also come to the ground.
You might also be confused sometimes and they write a letter to you in such a way that it looks like it is the correct letter.
Your credit card number, debit card number, and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a new method of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that there should be avoidance of this love, there should be consciousness and there should be some falsehoods that should be shared by sharing their friends and friends.
I would like to say that Shilpi Verma has brought good things to my attention, you would have experienced that, but perhaps you would not have seen it so seriously, but I think there is a need to look at it.
My dear countrymen, while the Parliament session is going on these days, I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Moreover, they collected plastic bottles or oil cans in the village by searching and collecting them and planting them with soil and planting plants and making them vertical guardians.
And in a way this vertical garden has been created in plastic bottles towards the railway station and it has been completely renewed.
If you ever go to Aligarh, then definitely look at the station.
Nowadays, these reports are coming to me from several railway stations in India and the local people are identifying their area on the walls of the railway station through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how a change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those who have been working in this way in the country, special greetings to my colleagues from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with you, you also have festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in temples, in worship places and you will also be associated with the festival outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival in our country.
Like last year, can not you offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Think, give such a gift to the sister who really protects her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in a free India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal, new zeal, we can make a pledge to do something for the country.
The whole country will be colored with the color of the freedom fighters and once again feel the fragrance of freedom all around.
This atmosphere should not be a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you too will do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture to the NarendraModi App.
Make an environment in the country.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August I get a privilege of talking to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your talk as intensely from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come to your mind, who feels that as your representative, as your Prime Servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write and send me.
Whatever is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I invite you, let us remember the virtue of the freedom fighters, let us remember the great men who spent their lives for India and move forward with a resolve to do something for the country.
Greetings to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to All India Radio for their successful efforts to present the matter of this mind in regional languages at 8. 00 pm.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later convey their feelings to me through letters, telephones, through MyGov website, through Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the government's work.
How active the government should be in public interest, how primary it should be for public interest, this connection with you people is of great use.
I hope that by becoming more active, you will definitely emphasize on how democracy goes on with public participation.
The heat is increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is experiencing heat fire.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The jungle became less, the trees were cut and in a way mankind destroyed nature and paved the way for its own destruction.
5th June is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment all over the world, there is concern.
This time United Nations has put this topic on the ero Tolerance for Film Fieldlife Trade on World Environment Day.
It will definitely be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water and how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen the fire in the forests in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir and Himalayas in the past.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have done a meeting of all the drought-affected states, but I did not do so.
What the states have to say, listen to them closely.
Generally, in the government, how much money was spent by the Government of India and how many expenses were spent - it does not matter much closer than that.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government that many states have made very good efforts, in relation to water, in the context of environment, in dealing with the drought situation, for the animals, for the affected persons and in a way the government of any party in every corner of the country, it was realized that there was a focus on permanent solutions to deal with this problem, for a long period of time.
In a way, it was a learning experience for me and I have asked my NITI Aayog to work on how to take the best practices in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh, have made a lot of use of technology.
I would like to convey the specially successful efforts of the States by NITI Aayog to us and the States.
Public participation is the basis for a great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some offerings and even a little offerings fall, there is an anguish in the mind.
Raise him and apologize to God five times.
This water is also God's offerings.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should suffer.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important, water conservation is equally important. Therefore, per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and minimum water harvesting crops.
Now it is a matter of happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, somebody is using drip-irrigation, somebody is doing sprinklers.
I have been sitting with the states and some states have also successfully used drip-irrigation for paddy, water and wages have also been reduced.
When I heard from these states, there are several states that have taken very big targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a great job in drip-irrigation and they have tried to add 2-3 lakh hectares each year to micro-irrigation.
If this campaign is going on in all the states then farming will also benefit greatly and water will also be accumulated.
Our Telangana brothers have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers very well through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharge in the Neeru Progress Mission.
In the mass movement that Maharashtra has created, people are also sweating and giving money.
I really feel that this movement will be of great use to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh's Balram Talab Yojana - nearly 22,000 Talabs are not small statistics
Rajasthan and Gujarat, where there are older times, have launched a big campaign to revive them as a water temple.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Water Supply Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a massive campaign of heck fam.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have started a small obstacle in the rivers and have campaigned towards preventing ten-ten, twenty-twenty kilometers of water.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that we decide this June, July, August, September - we will not allow even a single drop of water to be wasted.
And this is not just a matter of farmers
This is a matter related to everybody in the villages, the poor, the laborers, the farmers, the urban, the rich and the poor. Therefore, if the rainy season is coming, the water should be our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali, we should also enjoy how much water we saved, how much water we saved.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
What a precious treasure is given by God
Media gave a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that the media should guide people towards saving water, run campaigns and become a media partner for ever eliminating water crisis. I invite them too.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to create a transparent India.
If we have to bring many systems from one corner to the other, then our old habits will have to change slightly.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic on which if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give such a vegetable in return.
Business was carried out only through a barter system.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards cashless society.
We can also get the money and also pay the money through the electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can pay the bill.
And this will never raise the question of stealing the wallet from the zeb.
There will not be any concern about accounting, there will be automatic accounting.
The beginning will look a bit difficult, but once you get used to it, this system will be simplified.
And this is the possibility that the bank accounts of nearly all the families of the country have been opened by us these days that we have launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
We can move forward towards this cashless society by coordinating with the Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given with Jan-Chan account.
In the coming days, this card is going to be used both for credit and debit.
There's no need to remove, count out the money from the zeb.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever initiatives have been taken by the Government of India, how to pay money through a PSLV
It will be very easy to manage through your mobile phone and it is a matter of happiness that N.P.I.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your doorstep.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems then we will not need this currencies, we will not need notes, we will not need money, business will run automatically and this will lead to a transparency.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now he can not live without it.
It may be that this cashless society also takes the same form but it will be better if it is in a short span of time.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are games of lympics and when the games start, then we sit on the threshold of the head.
Everyone has in their own way encouraged, encouraged and encouraged our sportspersons going for Rio Elympics.
Some songs, some cartoons, some good wishes, somebody encourages a game, but the whole country should create a very positive atmosphere towards these players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a very powerful force in itself. When the player feels that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with him then he becomes enthusiastic.
I had spoken for the Under-17 World Cup and the suggestions that I have received from all over the country and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootball has started to appear all over the country.
Many people are making their own teams by taking initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Maybe, many people would not have played, but there is so much interest in the games of thousands and millions of youth of the country that it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I have seen that such an attachment to Hotball also indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So, for Rio Elympics, we will create an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm towards all our players in the coming days.
Not everything should be done by the test of victory and defeat.
With the sportsman spirit, India has made its mark in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and excitement for our sportspersons.
Over the last eight-ten days, new results are coming from somewhere or the other.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard for the year, exams, 10th, 12th, one after the other.
It is clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a matter of happiness.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
Once again I would like to tell those who have not succeeded that there is a lot to do in life.
If there is no result according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
We should live with confidence, we should move ahead with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come to me and I had never thought of this subject like that.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me this thing, hey man, four marks used to come more, you would have 90 percent.
I mean, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, for four marks, you had 90 percent.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
Wasn't that good what I did
Did I fall even less
I don't know, I have a burden on my mind.
Gaurav, I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that perhaps this pain will not only belong to you but also to millions and millions of students like you because it has become an atmosphere that finds dissatisfaction rather than satisfaction for what has happened, this is another form of negativity.
We can never take the society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from everything.
It would have been better if your family, your friends and friends had appreciated your 89.33 percent, you would have wished to do more by yourself.
He has also written to me Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, almost like this.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poem completely, but I had read it a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the anvas of life.
I wish, any one of the spectators on the picture of my pain would have shed tears.
This was the word of poetry, I do not remember it anymore, but it was a poem long ago, but this was the feeling.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will only say to you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening, but keep on talking about yourself and try to do something better.
But if you dont satisfy what you have got, you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
Dissatisfaction arising out of success does not make the ladder of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this thing more than neighbors and parents and companions that please do not impose your expectations on them by pleasing with your children.
Friends, have sometimes failed in life, does that life fail
Whoever cannot bring good marks in the exams goes a long way in sports, goes ahead in music, goes ahead in artwork, goes ahead in business.
God has given everybody a wonderful mode.
Just recognise your inner strength, emphasize it, you will move forward.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument called Santur.
There was a time when the Santoor instrument was connected to the Folk Music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who touched him and today made an important instrument of the world.
The clarinet - clarinet was in a limited place in the whole area of our music.
Most of the kings and princes used to have their place on their gates.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan touched the clarinet, today became the best instrument in the world, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also makes the path of life unbalanced.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the second for which I constantly urge, that is yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction and reverence for yoga throughout the world and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have an invaluable gift to us, which we have given to the world.
The world with stress gives the strength to live a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure. Being healthy in the life of a person associated with yoga, being balanced, wealthy of a strong will, a life full of unbelief, concentration in every work, these are simple achievements.
June 21 - Yoga Day, this is not just an event, it should be expanded, it should be its place in the lives of every individual, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And for this 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes the collective atmosphere becomes the cause of change in the life of a person.
Look, get it done in your village, get it done in your neighborhood, get it done in your city, in your school, in institution and even in Even Offices.
Start a month from now, look, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that Yoga and pranayama are collective in many offices as soon as they get regularly in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to stay behind anywhere.
Your health is very important for making India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I constantly associate you with Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2016
Please change this condition, Raviji has expressed his anger, but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry at the situation, you will remember that former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that print only positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to keep saying this thing continuously, a newspaper had written to me a few days ago, he had said that we have decided that we will not give any negative news on Monday, we will give positive news.
This time also I noticed that a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received and there are many stories, suggestions and inspirations. Everyone wants to do something or the other.
You will remember the last time I had talked about a book on Premchand jis stories and we had decided to share some things with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people shared information on a variety of books
I was glad that people are discussing and discussing books on subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life-style, and so on.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to admit is that I can ' t now spend too much time reading books
But one advantage is that if you send by writing then I get the opportunity to know about many books.
But with this experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to carry it forward.
Why shouldn't we just make a permanent book corner on the NarendraModi App and whenever we read a new book, write about it there, discuss it and you can suggest a good name for our books corner.
Friends, It seems that when I touched this point in the matter of water conservation, but perhaps today I feel that water conservation was a matter of touching your hearts even before I said it was a favorite subject of the common man.
And I feel that these days the hearts of India have been shaken in the matter of water.
Several scholarly and effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation.
Be it the government or the NGOs, they are doing something at the war level.
Looking at the competence of collectivity, it feels very good and satisfying.
Villagers donated labour and gave a definite direction to the waterfall flowing from the mountains.
That too pure indigenous method
Not only this, soil erosion and crop waste is stopped, but the fields are also getting water.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of crops that require less water and there is no loss to the farmer.
I would particularly like to congratulate the Haryana Government for communicating with the farmers, inspiring them to move away from conventional farming and to low-water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from all sections of society reach fairs
We can effectively deliver the message of water conservation in these fairs, exhibitions, street plays, festivals as well as the message of water conservation.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and especially the achievements of the children, their exploits, give us a new energy and that is why today I feel like talking about some children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Alamanda.
You will also be filled with pride and enthusiasm by what I will tell you about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems, standing at the door of death, but all these ten children have defeated not only cancer, cancer, but have illuminated the name of India all over the world with their exploits.
In sports, we often see that players become champions after winning tournaments or after humiliating the medal, but this was a rare opportunity, where these people were champions before participating in the sports competition and they too were champions of the war of life.
Actually, World Childrens Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer survivors who have emerged fighting cancer in their lives take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Hootball and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, in terms of space, 2019 has been a very good year for India.
Our scientists had launched the A-Sat in March and after that there was not much discussion about the big and important news like A-Sat at that time.
While we achieved the ability to kill Satellite, three hundred kilometers away from the A-Sat missile in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country to achieve this achievement and now, on 22nd July, the entire country took pride in seeing how Chandrayaan-II had moved from Sriharikota towards space.
Photos of the launch of Chandrayaan-II filled the countrymen with pride and zeal, happiness.
Chandrayaan-two, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-two, will make our understanding more clear about the moon
This will give us more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what kind of two great lessons I have learnt from Chandrayaan-II, then I will say, these two lessons are aith and earlessness.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, believe in our talent and capabilities
You will be happy to know that the Chandryan-two is completely Indian-colored.
It's Indian with Heart and Spirit
is a fully indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it comes to doing something new in the new field, it is going to happen.
Just as our scientists, in record time, day and night, corrected all technical issues and launched the Chandryan-Two, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
It should be a matter of pride for all of us , and , despite the disruption , they have not changed the time .
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but, always remember, we have the power to overcome it.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the student friends of the country, with the young friends, about competition, and I invite the youth of the country to participate in a quiz competition.
I request young friends, students to participate in this ui Competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with their stake.
I specially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious
These victorious students will have a historical event in their lives, but for this you will have to take part in the ui Competition, get the highest marks, you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing
Our mindset has given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the mindset.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
Its not that we have achieved an ideal position in cleanliness but the way cleanliness campaign has been successful in public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, but we are not going to stop so much.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in Media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful some time ago
He started with his team with Lodhi Garden dustbins
Through the street art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of Bridge and school to the slums, they started engraving their talent and people also got along and in a way this process started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
There is no sound in the colours and lines, but the rainbows produced from these pictures prove to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making waste from waste.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I have read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This event belonged to Mohammad Aslam, brother of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it is good to listen to the program
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in June
I think such programmes should be organized every three months
Besides, the programme should also have online monitoring arrangements.
In my view, this was the first such programme of its kind, in which the public communicated directly to the government.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it my curiosity about knowing about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I got to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also know about it.
This program shows how the people of Kashmir are desperate to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are.
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never been seen by the villagers directly reached the villages, they themselves came to their doorsteps to understand the obstacles in the development work, to solve the problems.
This programme lasted a week and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state, government officials gave detailed information about government schemes and programmes to the villagers.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened 
How can their income be increased 
What can their services affect the lives of the common man  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Friends, This programme was not an official Khanapuri that the officers returned after roaming around the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things were also included to make this program interesting
Sports Competition for children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, job cards of MNREGA and SST certificates were also distributed.
People of Kashmir become open partners in this festival of development
It is a matter of happiness that the Back to Village programme was organised in such remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day and a half days while climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their reception that they stayed in the villages for more than two days
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, participate in a large number of people and prepare plans for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred and obstruction in the path of development can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpeeth Awardee Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented the glory of Sawan Month in one of his poems as follows
Throughout India, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way.
Whenever We look around you in this weather , it appears as if the earth has covered a green sheet .
All around, a new energy starts transmitting
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kanwar and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the love of brother and sister also comes.
You will be happy to know that this time the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
Since July 1 till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave .
More than the number of pilgrims who had joined this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time they have joined in just 28 days.
I would like to especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey are convinced of the warmth and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months since the Chardham Yatra started in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time since the horrific disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have arrived there.
I appeal to all of you to go to those parts of the country whose beauty is made during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel cannot be a teacher bigger than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Saawan will bring new energy, new hopes and new hopes to you all
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of uit India
I would like you to make some special preparations on 15th August. You must find a new way to celebrate this festival of freedom.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains are taking place in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we see TV, the only aspect of the rain looks flooded, flooded water, traffic jam on all sides
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmer, shining birds, flowing waterfalls, green sheet covered earth, you will have to go out with your own family to see this.
It brings rain, freshness and happiness with you both. My hope is that this monsoon will continue to fill you with happiness.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
Today people of Christian community are celebrating Easter worldwide.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you.
And there will be a criterion for some people because on the one hand you will be waiting for the match of India and Australia on the other hand.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
There's a good momentum.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports.
It is time, a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
India won the Gold Medal in 1951, 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked fourth in 1956 Lympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower bed, went back, fell and fell.
Hootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestions
I believe that there is a great opportunity to brand India at the global level.
I consider the opportunity to identify the youth power of India, what was found in the match, what was lost in that sense.
By preparing for this host, we can decorate our strength, express our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on NarendraModiApp, please
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism during the holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time also I had requested you people to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, food and living habits do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see, you will be watching all your life, you will be watching
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to travel a lot.
When there was no chief minister, there was no prime minister and there was a young age like you, I traveled a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you contribute something to cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way but it's happening.
Can you also emphasize cleanliness on tourist destination as a tourist
I believe my young men will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But we should decide that if we have to emphasize our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism to us and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is the government, the institutions, the society or the citizens, all of us have done this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, I do not like this thing that the holidays should come in such a way.
You also think in this direction.
Will your vacations, the important years of your life and its important time go the same way
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you make a solemn pledge to add a new talent to your personality on holidays
If you don't come to swim, then you can make a pledge on holidays, if you don't know how to swim, if you don't know how to swim, if you don't know how to swim, then I will go on a bicycle by deciding on holidays.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, so will I learn typing
How many types of skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we inspire our powers
Now think that someone needs a lot of clases, a trainer, a very big essence, a big budget.
Just assume that I will make a best of the waste.
Look at something and start making it.
Namaste Prime Minister, in the last summer holidays you said that birds also get heat, so we should keep them in a pot in water and keep them on our balcony or roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I enjoyed it, on this pretext I became friends with a lot of birds.
I request you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something on this subject but that Abhi had reminded me that last year I was in a pottery outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi for a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved those birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - will not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donations and fill in the hood, we will fill the sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and also express my gratitude that you have reminded me of a very important thing.
Shilpa Cook from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that milk sellers come to our house, newspaper sellers come, postman come.
Sometimes those who sell a utensil pass through there, those who sell clothes pass through.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Have we ever watered it
I am extremely grateful to you Shilpa. You have put a very sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
It is true that this thing is small but if the postman came to the house in the middle of the heat and we got water then he would like it.
Well, this is the nature of India.
But Shilpa, I am grateful that you have observed these things.
What is the situation in the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the period of good harvest these days, what are the medicines suitable
Not only this, there is a button in it that directly connects you with agricultural scientists and connects you with the experts.
If you put any of your questions in front of him then he answers, explains, you people.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters should download this farmer facility App on their mobile phones.
Why don't you try something out of it
And yet if you feel a little lack then you should also complain to me.
But our countrymen also have to think about what will happen without water
Is it time for us to get water in our ponds and ponds through the flow of water in our ponds where there is garbage or some other effect then the water stops coming and due to this the water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places for more water conservation by digging them once again
If the water is saved in the first rain, if the water is saved, the ponds are filled, if our rivers are filled with drains then sometimes the rain falls behind then our loss is reduced.
This time you must have seen that 5 lakh ponds have taken the lead in making farm ponds.
MGNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water harvesting.
There will be many such villages in the country, many such progressive farmers will be there, many such aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more Vertilizers has made our mother earth sick and we are the sons of Mother Earth.
This is similar to the Certificate, no matter how excellent the certificate is, but if we use more and more Certificate then it will become a cause of waste.
The more water will be saved, the more the farmer will benefit, the more life will be saved.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has concentrated World Health Day on Beat Diabetes and defeat Diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of sick guests penetrate in their homes.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six and a half milliondiabetes in India.
3 of the deaths are due to diabetes.
And there are two types of diabetes i. e. Type-I, Type-II.
And because of Type-2 habits, because of age, because of obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so it has been kept in World Health Day on 7th.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for that.
Physical labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not-o-nishan, it is not going to happen.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from the 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we dont hesitate to make medical check-ups.
And after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that oh, oh, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was young, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But the number of TB patients is very much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
If you check once then do it.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat it whether it is TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this government, doctor, medicine does not happen unless you do it.
And that is why today I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important occasions are coming in the month of April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Sahib Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate to have the privilege of visiting the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
To become a good citizen, Baba Sahib has given us a lot.
We can pay homage to them by following that path as a great citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Different states are celebrated in different states.
My best wishes to everyone for my New Year.
You can hear on your own time.
You can hear on your own mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to get information about him, to see him on TV.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to go.
As before, they dont go to the same route, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
There is a possibility of a lot of employment through tourism.
And your personality will be recognized so much that your confidence will increase so much.
It will probably be a matter of our colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App in your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Summer has been an opportunity for the rest of the country but for the farmers it becomes an opportunity to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his farm so that he does not want to waste even a drop of rain.
For the farmers, the time to start the season of the farmer is very important.
That food feels bad, right
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were scared but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You might have listened to my mind on the radio, but you might have noticed that the exams of the children are being started and some people's exams of the tenth-twelfth edition are probably starting on 1st March.
So the same will happen in your mind too.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your children's exams.
But if we change the way we look at the exams and the way we look at the exams then perhaps we can be free from anxiety.
I had said in my last episode that you must send me your experiences, your suggestions on NarendraModiApp.
I am glad that teachers who have been very successful, such students, parents and some thinkers of the society have written a lot of things to me.
The second thing came in so many thousands that I believe that this is probably a very important topic.
But most of us have limited the topic of exam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
From the suggestions made on my app, it seems that these topics should continue to be discussed throughout the country.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers especially in this matter of my mind.
I have heard what I have read, I will tell some of the things I have been told.
I will add whatever I feel.
But I believe that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for the students who have to give exams.
I would like to recite to you the message that Bharat Ratna Shri Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India, who have a sense of humility: - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that the exams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
I have only one message that your parents, your teachers, the rest of your family members, friends will do it.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparation is going on, how many apprentices you will score.
I would like to say that you will set up some targets for yourself and you will not come to the preservation of any other expedition.
You must work hard, but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
And I always tried to achieve those targets.
My focus was on ball pay and targets automatically became sloughy-slowly achievable.
I would like to tell you that it is very important for you to be positive.
Positive thinking will follow positive results.
So you must be positive and the one above will definitely give you good results, this is my full hope and I would like to give you the best wishes for the exams.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't suppress them under the burden of defecation.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal by yourself, decide your own target - free from the mind, free from the mind, free from the thinking, free from the power.
Why not compete
Why do we waste our time in competing with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our earlier records
You see, no one will be able to stop you from moving forward and when you break your own previous record then you will not expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from within.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of marks.
Where did you reach, how far
Do not get stuck in that account.
Life should be linked with a great purpose.
We should move ahead with a dream, we should be determined.
These examinations, whether we are going right or not, they account for it.
And that is why if we have a huge dream then the examination will become a festival of happiness in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
Let us take a very big objective and there will never be any less than expected, then there will be no disappointment.
And dare to insist, and to force, and try.
Thousands of people have written to me smaller things than mobile phones on my App.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in a healthy body.
Students should keep in mind your health along with your studies so that you can write well in the exams.
Now, on the last day, I will not say that you should start punishing and go for three kilometers and five kilometers to run.
But one thing is true that what is your routine especially during the eam days
Anyway, our routine should be conducive to our dreams and resolves for 365 days.
I agree with one thing of Shri Prabhakar Reddy Ji, he has specifically urged them to sleep on time and revision early in the morning.
Access to the eamination centre should be reached prematurely with the entrance and other things.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I do not dare to say this because I am a little indifferent to sleep and a lot of my friends keep complaining to me that you sleep very little.
This is a shortage of mine, I'll try to fix it too.
Sleeping is as important as your day-long activities and this is possible.
Otherwise, some people have a habit, they talk about long telephones before sleeping.
And when I talk about sleep, don't think I'm asking you to sleep for eam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good exam on the time of exam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the son came less, then tell him that Modi had asked for gold, so I had slept.
You will not do this ,
I will not believe it.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if one or half part of our body suffers a little.
Not only this, our routine also gets crushed.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You see, do not get used to composing yourself in the habit of composing yourself in the prescribed manner.
Fix it, check it out.
You must have seen these two types of people.
There is a negative impact on the consequences of the paper that will come in the teension.
On Viswanathan Anand, they will share their experiences.
You must have seen that their eyes also do not go around.
Never used to listen, Arjun's life incident was how he looked at the bird's eye.
Just like that, when we see Viswanathan playing, his eyes are at a bigger target and he is a manifestation of inner peace.
It is true that someone should say that peace within will come, it is difficult to say, but we should try.
You are not talking to friends or you are walking alone, you are walking furiously, you are shaking a lot of books, then it cant be a peaceful mind.
You imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and there are very good things below.
But suddenly a stone starts moving in the water and the water starts shaking, what is the best thing that looked below
If the water is calm, however deep it may be, it can be seen.
But if the water is turbulent, then there is nothing below.
You will not be able to find that treasure if you have a turbulent mind.
If you have a calm mind, your treasure will emerge completely and your exam will be very simple.
Sometimes I try to understand by concentrating more and then I feel stressed.
Then I think, no, I'll relax a bit, so I'll be fine.
So I have developed my own technology.
I'm doing a lot of deep breathing.
I breathe deeply.
Three times I breathe deeply, the time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind becomes quiet and ready to understand things.
Maybe it's my experience, you can also be useful.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If the parents are also educated in the house and if the parents are also teachers, then they write the entire paper again, tell me what happened.
Man, I made a mistake.
Hey man, I knew this, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in it.
Fresh memories of old joy and happiness.
If you ever go somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Spend half an hour after getting out of them.
The talk of Rajat ji is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting it in the present context, is trying to convey this ritual to Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to the revered Murari Bapu for giving us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I see that this time the people who have shared their experiences have discussed Yoga.
And it is a matter of joy for me that somebody whom I meet in the world these days, somebody does a little thing about yoga.
Well, friends, let me just say today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least exams, so do not do it today.
Do it then do it.
But it is true that Yoga is a very big key in the development journey of the inner world, whether it is in the student life or in the second half of life.
Simple key is simple.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you are familiar with Yoga, if you ask them about it, you will not have done the first yoga in the days of the exam, you will also tell them about two or four things which you can do in two to five minutes.
Look, if you can
Yeah, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, do you feel like going to the exam hall to sit on your bench at the earliest
Why do these things hurry
Why not manage your entire day's time so that if you stop in traffic, we can reach on time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing is, the number of time that we have received, the question papers that are instruments, we sometimes feel that this time will be eaten.
It's not like that, buddy.
You read those instructions closely, two minutes or three minutes or five minutes, there will be no loss.
But with the confidence of the same paper again, now I have this paper, no new questions are going to come up, I have to deal with so many questions and when I started thinking again, he has written that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I read that it does not come to me, but if I repeat the same thing, then I noticed that the question has been put in another way, but this is the same thing that I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult to understand the questions.
I assert that you should read the questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match with what you know, you see, it will be easier even before writing the question.
It is a matter of happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed on patience.
In very few words, he has given a very good message to all the students.
Whatever I spend half an hour in saying, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
What they have said is dedication, determination, diligence.
If you stay stuck, then fear will also be scared.
And a golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now on my App, Ruchika Dabus has shared his eam experience.
He said that there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere in his family at the time of exam, and this discussion was also held in his fellow families.
Together, a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, "positive approach, positive frame of mind positive energy".
Why not at any stage of life, excellent examples, truthful events also inspire a lot, gives a lot of strength and creates a new path in times of crisis.
We all read about Thomas Elva Edison, the inventor of the Electricity Bulb, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that there are possibilities of success in failure too.
J. K. Rolling is an excellent example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter Services is popular all over the world today.
But it was not from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face
Rolling himself had said that in the difficulties, he used to put all the energy in that work, which really meant for him.
Nowadays, not just the students, the entire family and the entire school becomes the teacher.
However, without the support system of parents and teachers alone, the situation is not good.
Whether it is teachers, parents, even senior students, we become a team, we move ahead with the same thinking as units, and in a planned manner, the examination becomes easier.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App, he has complained that the parents should never put pressure on their children to demand more marks.
Only encourage to prepare.
They should be relaxed, they should worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not put the burden of his expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to tell the parents more today.
Please do not pressurize.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Build a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, see, your son or daughter, how much confidence will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, science, technology should become a simple part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes successes are very late and when success comes, the vision of the world also changes.
If you may have been very busy in the exam, perhaps you might not have had many problems in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important dinner in the world of science.
Scientists from all over the world worked hard, generations came, did something or the other, and after nearly 100 years it took a success.
Gravitational waves were highlighted and detected with the fortune of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein in the last century, but is also considered a great discovery for Physics.
But as an Indian, all of us are happy that the sons of our country, the promising scientists of our country were also associated with it in the process of all discoveries.
I would like to heartily congratulate all those scientists.
Our scientists will also be trying to pursue this dinner in the future.
There are two such arrangements in the world, India is the third.
By joining India, this process will get a new strength and new momentum.
India will certainly become an active partner in the process of this important scientific dinner of human welfare among its limited resources.
I once again congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, from tomorrow you can listen to my mind by missed call and listen to this number in your mother tongue.
I also have to give an exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians are going to take my examination.
But yes, you must have seen, I must have heard that how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just, let me get an exam tomorrow, let's start with you.
And if all of us are successful then the country will also succeed.
Friends, I also convey my best wishes to you all.
Free from the stress of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind, remain firm.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2015
I have a lot of observation on this portal.
No, we have to bring about changes in accordance with the requirements of India, we have to bring about changes in the requirements of the poor, we have to make it physically labourable, but some youngsters make such a thing through innovation that the poor get some comfort in their wages, I consider this as a start-up.
Then I came to my mind that from the eyes we feel that perhaps he is a disabled person, but from the experience he feels that he has an extra power, an extra power and then I came to my mind, why shouldn't we use the word Divyang in our country instead of disabled persons
On 26th January, when we observe Republic Day, can we observe the citizens, the children of schools and colleges celebrate the statues of great men in our city, the cleanliness of that complex, the cleanliness of that complex, the best cleanliness, the best beauty on 26th January
Dear countrymen, Namaste.
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated the holidays very well.
There would have been an opportunity to go somewhere.
Business jobs have also started with new enthusiasm.
Christmas preparations on the other hand will also have started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes festivals come to use to fill wounds, and sometimes festivals give new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes in this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Every corner of the world constantly reports about natural calamities.
And there are reports of such natural calamities that have never been heard or thought about.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is growing.
In our own country, the way in which excessive rainfall and that too unseasonal rains have been caused for a long time, especially in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people were killed.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full force in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Right now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I am sure that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, it will start moving at a rapid pace and will continue to play its role in furthering the country.
But when we look at the crisis all around, we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be part of an agriculture department, because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was limited to here.
Today its form has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake, I had spoken to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
There has been a good beginning.
Today, I have got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide a lot of people about farming.
One of my questions is that how these people set fire to the fields, how to guide the straw or the wheat foam to the people, how they are spoiling the micro-organisms that are being polluted to the mother earth and how they get relief from it in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh Ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
One is happy that you are a farmer who cultivates organic farming.
And they themselves do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers very well.
And your concern is correct but this is not the only thing that happens in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of our people all over India and traditionally we follow the path of burning the remains of our crops.
Secondly, what are the measures, there is no training.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come to the cities, a little sound was heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The residues of the crop are also very precious.
They are an organic manure in themselves.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the earth burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment, imagine that our bones are strong, our hearts strong, our kidneys are good, but what happens if the skin above the body burns
Similarly, burning the residues of these crops does not just burn the throat, it burns the skin of the Mother Earth.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And therefore, he should make a positive effort.
Once again this thread is suppressed in the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a pit is piled up in a pit and put some water of earthworms and then it becomes a good organic manure.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated bananas.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, he used to spend Rs. 5,000, 10 thousand and 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And till the people who took it did not come with a tractor-actor, they kept standing like this.
However, some farmers have developed 66, 8-8 inch pieces of that knot and buried it in the ground.
So the experience came that there is so much water in this banana thread that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get outside for three months.
Today, the demand for that thump has increased.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on the 3rd of December, International Day of Persons with Disabilities will be remembered by the whole world.
Last time I had discussed the organ convention in Mann Ki Baat.
I had also spoken about the helpline of NEET for organ convention and I was told that after that thing of mind there has been an increase of about 7 times in phone calls.
Film actress Raveena Tandon, very well-known people associated with it.
Organ Convention can save valued lives.
Angadan brings immortality in a way.
When an organ gets a new life from one body to another then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What else can be a bigger donation than this.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness on this sector and in the true sense the needy will get the best help because these help cannot be obtained from anywhere else unless someone donates.
As I have said earlier, 3rd December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also rich in a great courage and capability.
Sometimes the pain occurs when they ridicule sometimes.
Occasionally a sense of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, change our vision towards them, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass through.
If we get a little trouble then we sit to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it work
And that is why all these are a source of inspiration for us.
His determination, his way of fighting with his life and his desire to transform the crisis into strength is also worthwhile.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 is aged.
In 1996 Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was shot by the terrorists.
Lost a part of intestine and intestine.
The spirit of serious nature has become injurious.
The ability to stand on his feet always went for help, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism could not even hurt them.
His own strength, but the biggest thing is that without any reason, an innocent person has suffered such a big problem, the youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no rage, this crisis has also been converted into sensitivity by Javed Ahmed.
He offered his life in social service.
The body does not accompany, but for 20 years they have been immersed in children's studies.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled persons in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
Giving new light to live, showing the way.
On 3rd December, there is an opportunity to inspire everyone by remembering them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we depend on governments.
For the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived, there is a constant link between the government and the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad experience in life with some government babu.
And that very bad experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout our life.
There is a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do such good things with the spirit of service, with dedication and with dedication that never comes to our sight.
Sometimes we don't even know because it is so easy that we don't know that any government system, some government officials are doing this thing.
ASA workers in our country which are network in the whole country.
We have never heard of discussions about ASEA workers among the people of India, nor have you heard them.
But when I have become an example of his success in the world as a world famous family entrepreneur of Bilgates Foundation.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both such billgates and Milindagates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
They are spending their retirement time and whatever they have earned throughout their lives to work for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASHA workers, they admire them so much, they admire them so much, and they have so much to say that what is the dedication to the ASHA workers.
They tell us how much enthusiasm is there to learn new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government specially honored an ASEA worker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is an optimist and the entire population of the schedule tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Manisingh, a hope-worker of this village, decided that now I will not allow anyone to die from malaria in this Tendagav.
If he goes home and gets the news of a small fever, then get to know.
Based on the primary arrangements that have been taught to him, it is necessary to get treatment.
Emphasis on using every household pesticide mosquito nets.
As soon as the child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be done, the ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with full dedication for the entire village to avoid mosquitoes.
And he fought with malaria, prepared to compete with the whole village.
So how many Jamuna Mani will be.
How many millions will be there next to us
We'll look at them a little bit with respect.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How do the society become big companions of happiness and misery
I salute all such ASEA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to look at it.
Not only this, you should also show it to others and maybe you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss books and if any enthusiastic youngster goes to the schools in the neighborhood with these books and tell the children of class VIII, Class II that this happened here.
So you can truly become a social teacher.
I invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
There is also concern about climate change, global warming and drug addiction and it is getting approval as a standard before doing everything.
Earth temperature should not increase anymore.
It is also the responsibility of everyone.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, we should shut the street lights and bathe in the full moonlight for hours.
You should experience the light of that moon.
A friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, so I wanted to tell you this thing too.
In Kanpur, it does not seem that a woman has got the privilege of reading more.
But one such thing is being done that perhaps no one would have thought.
He is working with solar energy to provide light to the poor.
He is fighting war with darkness and illuminating his name.
She has formed a committee of women and has installed a plant of solar energy lanterns and she provides lanterns for 100 rupees per month.
About Rs. 3-4 per day is spent but the entire household is illuminated and this noorjahan continues to work with solar energy to recharge the lantern throughout the day.
Now look at what the big people of the world would do for climate change but a noorjahan may inspire everyone.
And anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate DEET as he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the nation and the world.
Many congratulations.
Thank you Abhishek ji.
The message you sent to me from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA scheme und the unfunded.
Those who do not get the money, they get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has been good. In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got Rs. 42 thousand crores from the Pradhan Mantri MRAY scheme.
Whether it is a washerman or a barber or a seller or a seller of milk.
People doing small businesses and I am glad that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are SC, ST, B, people of this class who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told the story of his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
Someone just told me that there is no Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
Under the MRA scheme, he received a loan of Rs. 8.
And they started the business of sewage dress, cleanliness.
I had said in connection with my cleanliness campaign that cleanliness campaign is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker, they are doing that work and I was told that in such a short span of time they returned 2 lakh rupees to the bank.
After all, this is the intention under our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she got 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
She is working to make a wallet.
And she makes a wallet but earlier she used to get more money from interest and used to run a business with great difficulty.
Now, due to his good amount of money coming together, he made his work better.
And earlier due to the extra interest and due to the reasons he used to spend more money these days, he started saving more than one thousand rupees per month.
And his family started growing a good business too.
But I would like the scheme to be more propagated.
All our banks are more sensitive and help smaller people.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
People who do small things are the economic power of the country's economy.
We want to emphasize that.
Good, but better to do.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that should be consistently aware of social life.
The National Awareness Vehicles International Vigilance is the pride of liberty, the unity of the country should continue.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, I want to make it a scheme.
MyGov had sought suggestions on him.
What is the structure of the programme
What's the logo
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big priests have also been declared.
You should also apply your creative mind.
How can Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra of unity integrity connecting every Indian
What is the plan, what is the program
Whether it is life-style, spectacular or life-style, it is easy to connect everyone.
What will the government do
What do you do Civil Society
There may be many things.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I will urge you to exercise.
I would urge you to use these good weather for some time or the other to keep the body healthy.
And we should create an atmosphere in the family, this should be a festival of the family, this should be done by adding an hour to it.
So there is a good weather, then there will be a good habit.
Once again, I have got the privilege of joining you with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to be played in Mumbai.
This is the series named Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of All India Radio.
Congratulations are to be given that when I started talking about mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I have to talk about Kerala once again today.
The students of Saint Mary Per-Primary School of Chittoor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
On one hand, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb marks, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me that picture of Mother India's map.
Earlier I was surprised why they made a map of India with their thumb marks.
But when I read his letter, I realized that he had given a very good symbolic message.
These are those girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are also trying to make people aware in their area and their mission is Angadan.
They are running a mass awareness campaign for organ donation.
He has also staged drama by visiting many places, so that the understanding of Angad is spread among the people.
Angadan became a tendency and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter that you should appeal to the people about organ donation in your mind.
He says Angadan should make a festival.
These days I also receive a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyes need light.
The organ of the body can be donated after death in road accidents.
There are also a lot of legal confusions.
An attempt has also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to reduce paperwork and speed it up.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the front line in the field of organ donation.
Many social institutions, many NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
To promote organ transplant, National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NET) has been established.
A 247 Delpline 1800114770 service is also available.
And it has been said to us that Ten Tyakteen Bhunjitha is a very good description of the joy of renouncing Tyakten Bhunjitha.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor Thalewala, Hawker and his wife were diverted to GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this wiver was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by special arrangements.
And that operation was finished.
A life survived.
Angadan Mahadan
Ten Tyakten Bhunjitha, let us do this and we must emphasize this.
Dear countrymen, we just celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
After a few days, Deepawali will also celebrate the festival.
Eid also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
For the first time on the soil of India, such a huge scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
Outside Africa, one of the largest conventions of African countries is happening.
India-Africa relations are deep.
The population of India is the same population of African countries.
And if we mix both, then we are one-third of the world's population.
And millions of years ago, it was the same territory.
Later, these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And nearly 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural ties, diplomatic ties, but India plays a very important role in training the youngest generation of African countries.
Human Resource Development, Fapacity Building have read more than 25,000 African students in India.
And today there are leaders of many African countries, they have studied in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view, this Summit is very important.
Generally, when there is a summit, the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, a meeting of heads is going to be held in a summit.
Look, it is our endeavor that these people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the KRD Ministry, has done a very good programme.
As many affiliated schools of BSF, a day competition programme was organised among their children, a programme was organised to write poems and to enhance their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and outside India.
And thousands of schoolchildren wrote things that emphasized India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar, Memorial of Mahatma Gandhi, an exhibition, Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar is reaching Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, village-village people saw it.
There were very good compositions in this competition.
My attention goes to a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RC Ministry.
I had proposed a proposal on August 15 last year regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying with a big heart.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
Where these ideal villages are happening, the head of the village, the collector of that place, some MPs of that place, the Indo-Government, all the state governments together discussed the topic of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist extremists, many areas of the area have been wasted.
However, our MPs are very senior, they have also been Deputy Speakers in Parliament, Mr. Karia Munda ji, they have spent their lives for the tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate the Honble MP Shri Karia Munda ji.
I got the same news from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself was consumed in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose the Dhanpuri Gram Panchayat for the ideal village through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the arrangements are being made but they have done a very special innovative work.
Mr. Ruwala ji started the Kurtaya Kut Sugarcane festival in the village on 11th March.
The people of all the areas united in it.
How can the village be made a center of economic activity, how can the village market its own production
His effort to make an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village is truly an officer of congratulations, Shri Ruwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, How can it be that there is no talk of cleanliness
Savita Rai has sent me a message from Mumbai via a telephone. Every year we clean our homes to prepare for Diwali.
Let us keep this Diwali clean along with our homes as well as the outside environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media has launched a massive campaign and after Diwali, all the firecrackers were seen and they said that this is not right.
So it is true that we should worry about the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I want to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
And I was also watching how many kinds of activities were going on.
How many people are working themselves as a forest like forest mission for this.
How many places are there in our country that have been kept so clean
All these things were highlighted and I heartily congratulated the commendable work of India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been started, I have seen that TENADU from Andhra and Telangana and especially Mr. Ramuji Rao is very old but his enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, hospitals or parks, a big campaign of cleanliness has been started in many places.
Now these news shows the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat in itself.
ABP News has started this programme in the name of India and it has helped to train the people of the country by highlighting the awareness about cleanliness.
There are hundreds of channels in our country, thousands of newspapers, everybody, I am not able to take the names of all, because of the lack of time, but this campaign has been launched.
And that is why Savita Rai Ji has suggested that the entire country is accepting this work and is taking it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor of Meghalaya, Mr. Shanmuganathan, he has written a letter to me and by writing a chitti, I have mentioned the Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has taken a lead in cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he was awarded the Leanest Village of Asia.
That is why, we all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will be able to say the 125 crore Indians with pride, see, we have freed our Mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has taken place.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know for anybody's recommendation. Does he have to suffer and how a group of brokers grabs money from him
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who completely checks a person in a minute or two-minute interview.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we should finish the tradition of interview on the small scale.
My dear young friends, today I want to proudly say that the government has completed the entire process and there will be no interview for recruitment in Group D, Group C and Group B posts of the Central Government.
1st January, 2016 will be implemented.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to all young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
Gold in our country has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold has been considered as a medium of economic security.
The key to crisis time is considered as gold.
Gold can become the economic wealth of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am happy that we are going to launch important schemes in the budget, in the festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and people especially buy gold on that day.
We have brought the Gold Monitoring Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it like you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier they kept in the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep the gold bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say, countrymen, cant gold become a property now
Whether gold can be converted from Lead-Money into a living force or not
That's what we have to do.
Do not keep gold in the house now.
Another thing is that in the sovereign gold bonds you do not have a gold bag in your hands.
So you'll get two and a half thousand rupees in exchange for that paper.
So we are starting this thing.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will keep this scheme of security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold quin.
It was almost 70 years since independence but we have been using the Foreign Gold Coin or the Gold Bullion Bars.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
Iron-male has introduced his strength.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was his dream.
Geographically he did it, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our contemplation, behavior, expression.
Several sects, numerous sects, many dialects, many castes, many surroundings and so many diversities, our country is full of diversity and this diversity is due to which we are proud.
If this was not a diversity then perhaps we could not do the beauty we are proud of.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity is the herb of development.
Over the last several years, on October 31, there are Run for Unity programmes in many corners of the country.
I have heard that even this time its plans are being made around, people are preparing for the race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race for unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race for unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Push forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali, there will be cleanliness in the house.
New things must have been bought.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I convey my best wishes to you for the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come to mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Deepawali, I have to visit Britain.
I am very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such classes of society, be it dalits, tribals, backward and promising children who go abroad.
I believe that when our children of India will be studying in the UK then this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage area for them, it will become an inspirational land and learning something in life but later on living for the country, this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that in my visit to Britain, I am specially thrilled, the topic had been confused for many years and now that building becomes a property of 1. 25 billion Indians, if Baba Saheb Ambedkar's name is connected then you can imagine how much pleasure it will be for people like me.
I will also get another opportunity in London, unveiling the statue of Lord Vishweshwar.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy, for the Empowerment of Women is a truly studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the soil of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are related then the hearts of all of us get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are connected with the talk of mind.
Through the telephone, I keep getting your suggestions through MyGov.in.
There is also discussion on All India Radio in your letters.
Calling government officials is discussed.
Some people write their problems, try to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but still there are so many languages that I could learn.
But still I am grateful to All India Radio that they broadcast the matter of this mind at 8 pm in the regional language of each state.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the thing is of my mind.
In the past, I was completing one year. Today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2015
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
And on the other hand, on the one hand, let us talk about the cleanliness of the infants of this country, on the other hand, what can be the good fortune of a bigger country than this An atmosphere of hatred and hatred that is going on in the country, on the other hand, there has been an awareness about cleanliness, this government will also compel the governments to work.
We have to move ahead with this movement, we have to move ahead with deficiencies and we have to make this India, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, when we will be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Just like Sonam Patel, I met a very young girl, she is a daughter of a very poor family of Sundarpur resident of Varanasi, she is a daughter of a very poor family. And I was surprised that the girl, the entire Gita, she was very stubborn. But the biggest thing I felt that when I asked her, she used to tell her the verse, used to interpret it in English, used to define her in Hindi.
They said, we don't even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only Geeta reads and does something else
Once again, I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about mind.
In the far south, people are dyed in the festival of Onam, and tomorrow the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes related to social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, in a comprehensive manner, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small suggestion that on the festival of Rakshabandhan we should give this security scheme to our sisters.
The thick and thick information that I have received is that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I also convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a large scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
ero Balance had to open an account but the poor had saved, saved and deposited twenty thousand crores.
The mainstream of the economy is the banking sector and this system has also emphasized the scheme of bank friends to reach the poor house.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
Now thousands of people have become entitled to overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
And this belief that the poor can get money from the bank was also born.
Once again, I congratulate all the concerned and urge all the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts to not break the bond with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, now it's your job to hold it.
Our accounts should be active.
But in a very short span of time the enlightened, all my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again went to Gujarat on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brotherhood, this is the right path and we have to walk on the path of development on the shoulder side.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell the truth that the way in which I got the opportunity to listen to them, in a way some music is playing.
The choice of his words, his way of conversation, that is, the generosity in the Sufi tradition, in which there is a musical rhythm, all of them have experienced me among these scholars.
I liked it very much.
Perhaps the world has become the most necessary to reach the true nature of Islam in the right form.
I am sure that the Sufi tradition, which is associated with love, generosity, will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity and will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also been invited in it, and I am happy that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodhgaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a moment of great joy for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to tell you a special mention of Mann Ki Baat.
I have already mentioned this subject in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, heard me in public meetings, listened to me in the matter of mind.
I have been telling you once again that the government's mind is open on the issue of dispute regarding the Fund Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers, I have been saying this repeatedly.
This means that my government was formed, the situation before that has now been re-established.
However, there was one thing incomplete in it and it was that there were 13 such points which were to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it in the Ordinance but the matter was also complicated in these disputes.
Ordinance is being abolished, but the 13 points which are directly related to the benefits of the farmers, we are implementing these 13 points by bringing them under the rules so that there is no loss to the farmers, there is no economic loss to the farmers. And that is why we are completing the 13 points which were left in the earlier law and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan is not our mantra - the welfare of the villages, the poor farmers and that is why we had said on 15th August that not only the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department but we have made the decision of the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department which has been taken very fast.
I have to say one more thing that it was fifty years before the 1965 war two days ago and when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Mantra too.
And it is natural for all those martyrs to remember the Tricolor Flag of India, its grandeur.
I salute all the stakeholders of the victory of the 65th War.
I bow down to the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, there was a very pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to interact with the dignitaries of the country for hours.
They got the opportunity to listen, and I was happy that in the field of science, India is doing a very good job in many directions.
Our scientists are truly doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these amendments to the masses.
How to convert the principles into tools
How to add Lab to Land
We have to move forward as an opportunity.
I got many new information too.
I can say that he was a very inspiring person for me as well.
And I saw how many young scientists were talking with enthusiasm, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I think there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I keep getting many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
Emphasis has been laid on reforms in education sector.
I specially want to tell my young friends that I had told Red Fort on 15th August that why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want freedom from the tradition of interview below one level.
I am glad that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving ahead very fast.
Notices are being sent and nearly the decision will be implemented that small jobs will be left behind due to the interview.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deployment or corruption.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the sake of health, especially mothers and infant mortality rates, the All to Action World's 24 countries contemplated in the soil of India for their action plan.
This is the first time outside the US, this program was organized in another country.
And it is true that even today, nearly 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die in our country every year at the time of childbirth and immediately after that.
This is worrying and scary.
Well, the improvement is enough.
India has started to be appreciated internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue keeps on coming.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am talking about Swachh Bharat is directly linked to it.
We see advertisation on IT but we do not pay attention.
Advertisement is printed in the newspaper but we do not pay attention.
There are methods of maintenance of small things in the house with clean water.
There is widespread public education in these things, but we do not notice and sometimes we feel that we live in a very good house, we have very good arrangements and we do not know that we have water filled somewhere and somewhere we invite dengue.
I would urge all of you that we should not allow death to be so cheap.
Life is very precious.
It is not okay that the indifference of water, the indifference of cleanliness and the cause of death should be there.
Free scrutiny facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centres across the country.
From time to time, it is useful to save lives and co-operation with you all is very important.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali, festivals are celebrated in a way in our country.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see the rituals will become a nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news. I always say that now we will not get the good fortune to die for the country but we have got the good fortune of living for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
In the United States, there is a ycle race, it is very difficult, it has a race of about 4,800 kilometers.
This year these two brothers won this race.
See how everyone is making efforts to take the country forward.
And that is why, when such incidents hear, the chest gets strained.
Sometimes we commit serious injustice to our youth due to perception.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this process has been going on for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, we also get a lot to learn.
I have met many youngsters who say that brother, I have taken a fast in life today on cycle.
Some people say that I have kept a ycle day a week.
It's also good for my health.
And I also enjoy being a young man.
Nowadays, the bicycle also runs in many cities in our country and there are many people who promote bicycles.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two young men of my country hoisted the flag in America, I like to mention the direction in which the youth of India thinks.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I enjoy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai - had been hanging for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand and inspiring monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who will continue to inspire us to work for the dalit, the victims, the exploited and the deprived.
But at the same time, where Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has also been purchased.
When the Indians travelling all over the world go to London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to build in the state of Maharashtra will become our inspiration.
I bow down to the Government of Maharashtra for these two efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your thoughts before the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, because I believe that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
My best wishes to you all.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing kharif.
And a matter of happiness has come to my mind and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should have pulses, there should be some oil in vegetables etc. for eating.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much from the land as the country's youth.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was overwhelmed by hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who have failed their enemies' efforts, regardless of their lives.
The Kargil war was not fought only on the borders, every city of India, every village contributed to this war.
This war fought for those mothers, those sisters whose young sons or brothers were fighting against enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, the peacock had not landed.
And that is why today, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all these fighters.
On July 26, I consider it a bit more important because, in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we had launched MyGov on July 26.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, to add people to the work of development and today after one year it is my pleasure to say that nearly two crore people have seen MyGov.
Nearly 5. 5 lakh people made their comments and the most happy thing is that more than 50 thousand people suggested on PM applications, they took out their time, they did mind apply, this work was considered important.
Now the matter is small, but no one in the government ever noticed this, nor was it ever thought about it.
But the government seriously considered the suggestions of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are formed, the taglines are formed, the programme is created, the policy is formed, there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
There is an experience of a fresh air in governance.
A new consciousness is experienced.
These days, I have started suggesting on MyGov what I should say on 15th August.
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Daughter-daughter, speak on daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this brought me an idea, what should I say on 15th August this time, can you send me suggestions
You can send it to MyGov, write a letter on All India Radio and write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on 15th August should be suggested by the public.
I am sure you will send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I do not want to preach nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibilities of the state government, central government or local Swaraj institutions.
Just two days ago, I noticed a Delhi accident and after the accident, the scooter driver continued to suffer for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people keep writing to me on this thing that you should say something on the road safety.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari in Karnataka.
And when you look at the figures, the heart shakes.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, due to road accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that nearly one-third of those who die are young people between the ages of 15 and 25 and one death shakes the entire family.
The government must do whatever it wants, but I ask my parents, my children, whether they run two-wheelers or four-wheelers, the atmosphere of focus should also be increased in the family.
Another project is going to extend further, it is going to extend further, from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, from there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mandia highways, we have a washless treatment. And it means that who will pay the first fifty hours or not, who will not give the money, who will not give up all these concerns and who will get the best service in the road accident, how to get the best service, how we are giving priority to it.
Toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulance arrangements, all these things have been done after the accident to provide information about accidents across the country.
We all are really very dear to have a life, a life is very lovely and we need to see it in the form of one life.
Sometimes I say, become an employee Karmayogi.
In the past, some incidents came to my notice, I liked to talk to you, sometimes the person gets tired of doing a job, and for a few years it is fine, salaries are available, work will be done, this is the feeling.
I was glad to see this great example of how life can be brought to my work.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his ability can be linked to his work.
Maybe Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
Moreover, one thing came to my notice - the entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the entire group started a work that touched my heart and I liked this thing.
He started Operation Mali Yudh - Now someone will listen to it and it will be something else.
See how Rakshabandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes these small things enjoy my heart, so I am sharing it with you.
There is a small village by making hair in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now no person has to go to the open in that village.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated such a great festival.
These excellent examples of how the society is changing the values of life, how the minds of the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing to Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, in relation to North-East questions.
However, the people of Northeast are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
But today I would like to tell them that there is a separate ministry for the North-East.
They will go to the districts, they will go to the villages, they will meet the local government officials, they will talk to the people, they will talk to the citizens.
We will listen to the problems, we will do whatever the Government of India has to do to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come by visiting, they also feel that how beautiful state, how good people, now they have to develop this area, they have to stay by solving their problems.
If you return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is to go far east from Delhi, which I am saying Act East Policy, that is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all take pride in the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes these ideas also come to the fore, today if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead, then you will find one or half of the 100 students who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern that the trend towards science has come down.
It is very important to take interest in innovation, to encourage them, to know their capabilities.
I would also like to tell the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone ahead by writing so much reading then you should also go to a school-college near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience, your strength will certainly be useful for this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have started it and in the coming years, we will get 24 hours of electricity.
Even the children of the village, if you want to read in the days of the examination, do not have the problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then electricity can be obtained.
Today, even if we have to charge mobile phones, we have to go to another village.
The benefits that cities get should be met by the villages.
And that is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
I know that such a big country, lakhs of villages and villages have to reach far and wide.
But, for the poor only to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, I have decided to talk about different things.
In a way, our country has the opportunity to celebrate the month of August, the month of September and the festivals.
There are a lot of festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be of great use to me.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had prayed to you people that if you go anywhere on vacations, and if there is a memorable picture there then an Incredible India will be inaugurated.
When I said, I did not think that there would be such a tremendous result.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter Pay, Facebook Pay, Instagram.
I can say that more than one scene can be seen, India is full of diversity.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big thing that you people have done.
And I was so impressed that I too had re-tweeted it.
We will carry it forward, we will continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but sometimes the person within me loses himself from all the other dignitaries.
June 21, International Day of Yoga, I can say that my mind was agitated in the same way as I had put this topic in the NCC.
We can claim that the sun never falls in the world of yoga practitioners.
The way Yoga was honoured by the world by laying a palanquin, the way the entire world raised it on its shoulders, who would not be proud of it
The mind was overwhelmed.
And when the French people for whom the Sean River and the Field Tower are very glorious symbols, they chose that place to do yoga.
In New York, people performed yoga on the Times Sure.
If we talk about Australia, Sydney then the picture of Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by placing Yoga as per the pera House.
It is a matter of pride in itself whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's Euomo Cathedral.
Similarly, the NPC-Kepping Force also performed well for yoga.
Even in India, our soldiers were performing yoga on Siachen, white ice sheet, and on the sea, on all sides, wherever our naval ships were there, Yoga programmes were organized.
Delhi has registered its position in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogpath.
I am grateful to the country and the world, and I can say that this was not a programme.
It seemed as if every corner of the world had a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal and a new engagement.
A few days ago, when I had tweeted a photo on Twitter, a family from Vietnam with the help of a small child, it was so lovely that it became so popular all over the world.
Everyone, whether it is old men or women, whether it is village or city, whether it is developing countries or developing countries, everyone has joined it.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in the true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the heritage of this place, the world wants to know.
It is our responsibility that we should share this legacy with the world without logging it.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, what is new in it, like our family values, we do not know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
There are a lot of things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to the best.
The success of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility with joy and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the best yoga teachers to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of yoga from one platform to the world.
Introduction of institutions related to yoga, information about yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga then you can learn where to get a yoga teacher, where to prepare a database and I believe that you can do it.
Let us start from somewhere, this will also become a new power.
I see the events of the past few days from the perspective and from the perspective of the government, the running government, once the goal is fixed, we have seen how the results can be achieved.
And when there was despair all around, we should not forget that a year ago there used to be only one voice, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government and no one ever pays attention to it.
In 2-5 years, if a tiny news comes to the newspaper sometime or the other, then it will come in such a corner, a small department, but it will lead the Yoga Day.
And the small departments of the world have done such a big job.
If the goal is in front, then it is a sample of how much small units work.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the victims from Yemen.
Within hours, how did the people of India reach Nepal to help, when the government that was working to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank, all the bankers came to the ground and in a short span of time crores of countrymen were connected to the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed for toilets in schools from the Red Fort and I had said that we have to complete this work by August 15.
The work that was not done in 60 years was very courageous to do it in one year, about 4. 5 lakh toilets were constructed, but today I can say with satisfaction that there is a delay of 15th August but it has not been completed but people have completed the construction of toilets in almost every school.
It means government, people, government officials, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month we had launched three public safety schemes, I did from Calcutta.
There has been a very positive result in such a short time.
In India, very little work has been done in terms of public safety but due to these three schemes we are putting a big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people's security but we have to move forward.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a huge gift.
Let us all strive to fulfill this resolution by joining me.
When I talk about mind, many people also send suggestions to me.
This time I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that for the monsoon you must tell something about the matter of mind.
They have sent good suggestions.
You can also enjoy hot pakodas, bhajiyas, corns as well as tea in the rain.
But the way the sun rays give life, the same rain gives strength to our lives.
The water of the village should remain in the village, the water of the city should remain in the city, this should be our resolve and efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if it returns to the ground and there is a recharge in the ground then problems of the year are solved.
I always tell people that if you visit Porbandar in Gujarat and if you visit Mahatma Gandhi's house then there is a tank in the geography within his two hundred years old house where there was a provision of direct rain water.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water.
We can also do it.
All of us should be planting trees during this rainy season, planting trees in large quantities by social organizations, by youth.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a very successful experience.
This is my total rural technology.
When you plant a plant, plant an old soil pot in the bugle of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill the water twice a month, it will also run.
I also tell the farmers to plant trees instead of fencing on the edge of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days, diseases spread very much with water.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria begin to grow and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
Insistence on drinking pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of cases we will care will be far from us.
Water should also be needed, rain should also be avoided but disease should also be avoided.
Friends, We have just launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities livelihood.
In the same way, there should be a country that can equalize the world.
There should be such a smart city in the country and on the other hand the poorest of the poor should also have their own house to live in the country and the houses should have electricity, water, toilets and schools to read nearby.
In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of independence, we want to give our countrymen home.
With these three things, we have started a big scheme.
I am confident that all these schemes will help in transforming urban life.
I myself have been associated with you all through social media, you people keep meeting me with you people, you keep getting good information about the government.
But sometimes even a person sitting in a remote village touches our hearts.
You know, a Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho program is going on from the government side.
But when a person, society, village makes a program of government, then how much increases its strength.
In the past, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji, took him a very funny initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to the children.
There are about 100 districts in the country, in which this condition is worrisome.
The highest in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch of a small village of Haryana gives such a turning point to the Beti Bachao Abhiyan, then the mind is very happy and there is a new hope.
That's why I express my happiness.
But this incident has inspired me and therefore I also urge you to post the selifiewithdaughter with your daughter and take out the selifie with your daughter.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao will write a tagline that will give strength to this idea, it will be in any language be it English or Hindi or your mother tongue or any language.
The very motivational tagline I will retweet Selfie your daughter.
In a way, all of us can teach Beti Bachao Beti and convert this into a mass movement.
Brother Sunil started the work from Bibipur village of Haryana and let us all move forward together and I urge you to post the selfiewithdaughter.
So my best wishes to you all in this rain, please enjoy rain.
Make our country green.
You should continue the practice of Yoga, not for one day.
You see, you'll see the benefits.
Make a part of your life, do it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, keep sending photographs.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
I felt that there was very little about handicraft in it.
We have to reach the world, we have to reach the characteristics of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we will surely reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
He used to listen, repeat and sometimes his own words became an inspiration for the people of 130 crore countrymen.
You can imagine how it must have been in the middle of the period.
Perhaps, it wasn't a lifeless program
It was a life-style, a feeling of attachment, a feeling of heart, and because of this, the time spent in the middle was very difficult for me.
I was doing some missing every moment and when I talk of mind, I may say, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, Purushartha is yours, Parakram is yours.
Feeling an emptyness
But this Sunday has waited a lot
Well, I've got the chance
A lot of messages have come in the last few months in which people have said that they are missing the matter of mind.
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey from the world to the world.
This is my vital journey to the yum
My silent conversation with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions as to why I went to Kedarnath.
Most people have drawn political meaning from it
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell you other things today, but I will definitely do that because of this complication of Mann Ki Baat, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given the opportunity to fill up something.
The rest of your curiosity - I think I ' ll ever discuss it .
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your effort to emphasize a positive thing, I constantly feel about your point of view.
The letters that come to mind, the inputs that are received are completely different from the government functioning.
In a way your letter sometimes becomes a cause of inspiration for me and sometimes it becomes a cause of energy .
Sometimes some of your words do the job of sharpening my thought process.
People keep the challenges facing the country and the society in front of them and also tell them solutions.
If someone writes for cleanliness , he is expressing his displeasure over dirt , but also appreciates the efforts of sanitation .
If someone talks about the environment, he feels the pain, but at the same time, he also tells the experiments he has seen and the imaginations he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
Need to incorporate those strengths and talents, provide opportunities, implement them
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that all the 130 crore people want to join the country's development with strength and activism. And I must say this thing that I get so many letters in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls, so many messages are received, but the element of complaint is very low and someone has asked for something for himself.
When I analysis these things, you can imagine how much pleasure my heart will have, how much energy I will get
Actually I haven't come - you have brought me, you have made me sit and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, let's move ahead with the talk of mind.
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not confined to political circles, it was not confined to politicians, the movement was not confined to prison bars.
During the Emergency, every citizen of the country felt that some of them had been snatched.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the massive election campaign, the rich and the poor in our country, all the people were willing to decide the future of our country with happiness in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance and its amazing facts are also ignored.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted.
This number may seem very normal to us but if I say in terms of the world that if we leave a China then more people in India were voting than any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double
The number of total voters in India is more than the population of Europe
It introduces the vastness and broadness of our democracy
2019 Lok Sabha Election was the worlds largest democratic election in history so far
You can imagine how much resources and manpower would have been required to complete such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees made the election possible with hard work day and night
In order to successfully conclude this great mandate of democracy, about 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their duty, 20 lakh policemen from different states also laid the foundation of hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more voting was done than last time.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVMs (ME) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPATs (VVPATs) machines across the country for voting, you can imagine how big a frill
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, polling station was created for just a female voter.
Polling station at the highest level in the world is also in India
The polling station is located at an altitude of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another proud fact in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men
Polling percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are 78 women MPs in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission, and every person associated with the election process, and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth, don't book, I was urging you to give books instead of flowers in reception.
Since then , people have been giving books in abundance .
However, I could not get much time, but during my stay, I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again
His stories encompass the whole of India ' s mind .
When I was reading the story of his drunkenness, my mind went to the economic inequalities prevailing in the society itself.
This story of zamindar's son, Ishwari and the poor family's brother learns that if you are not cautious then you do not know when the impact of bad company gets affected.
The second story, which touched my heart inside, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, such a mature emotion at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his grandmother with a spoon from the fair, in reality, the human sensation reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a very big truth of life, child Hamid played the part of old Hamid.
One such big poignant story is the night of Puss
The story saw a live depiction of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life .
Even after the crop is destroyed, the light farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter.
Although these stories are almost a century ago, their relevance still feels the same
After reading these, I felt a different kind of feeling
When there is talk of reading, in any media, I was reading about Kerala's Akshara Library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated between the dense forests of Idukki.
The elementary school teacher PK Muralidharan and PV Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling in the bundle and putting it on the back
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people of every age group participated in this campaign of reading books
In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, I would urge you to take some time out and place the book in your daily routine as well.
You will really do a lot of enjoyment and write about all the books that you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat will be able to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water is of great importance in our culture .
Give your blessings , like your mother . Keep showering your grace on us .
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received from rains in a year are saved in our country .
I am sure, like other problems, we will also resolve this crisis with the participation of the people, with the manpower, with the strength, cooperation and determination of one hundred and thirty crore people.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping the importance of water paramount
This will enable faster decisions on all water related issues .
A few days ago I tried to do something different
I wrote a letter to Sarpanchs across the country to Gram Pradhan
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to accumulate water, to save the drops of rain water, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month crores of people have donated shramdaan in thousands of panchayats.
People in villages resolve to accumulate one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen, Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us a message. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
People there, once again ready to play their active role for water conservation
On behalf of me, all the Gram Pradhans, all the Sarpanches, my best wishes to all the Sarpanches for their activism.
There are many sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation
In a way, the entire village has become that opportunity.
It seems that the people of the village are now gathering in their village, just like water temples.
As I said, collective efforts can have very positive results
There can be no single formula for dealing with water crisis all over the country .
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways for this.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that is to save water, water conservation
Trainage lines are being corrected in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
The construction of tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimaipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, there has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on the Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we work together, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people will connect, water will survive
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am making three requests to the countrymen.
My first request is to start a mass movement for water conservation just as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement.
Together we should resolve to save every drop of water. And I believe that water is God's prasad, water is the form of Paras
Earlier they used to say that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras .
I say, water is mercury and from mercury, with the touch of water, new life is created
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell us about the water related problems, as well as spread the ways to save water.
I specially urge people from different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is the film industry, sports world, our friends in the media, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, people who make tales or tales, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake the society, connect the society, join the society
You see, we'll see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the place of birth of revered Bapu then there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu, there is a water storage tank of 200 years old and there is water in it and there is a provision to stop rain water then I always used to say that whatever Kirti temple goes to see the stalls of that water.
Let us connect with water conservation and inspire people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShakti hashtags
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude for one thing and also to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again on the occasion of Yoga Day, with the zeal and enthusiasm, three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for Holistic Health Care.
Everyone, in every corner of the world, if a yogic lover welcomes him as soon as the sun sets, then there is a complete journey of the sunset.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from air force to aircraft carriers, from A gyms to hot desert, from villages to cities, Yoga was not only done everywhere, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities, ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive individuals are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures that
Therefore, the promotion of yoga is a great work of social service.
Should not he be honored by recognizing such a service
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for their outstanding contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have made significant contributions in the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roi of Italy who started Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves
If this is a subject related to yoga, can Indians stay behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored, has been dedicated to Yoga for the last several decades.
It is a very important journey for me to connect with your thoughts.
Let's keep meeting, keep talking
Keep listening to your emotions, keep chanting, keep understanding
Sometimes I try to live those feelings.
Keep your blessings
You're my inspiration, you're my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the matter of mind and also play the responsibilities of life.
Then once again next month will meet again for Mann Ki Baat
Thank you very much to me
This weather is also hot on one side, so there is also a lot of grief.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
I have done a special one hour programme and I have seen that there was no programme for the evils of the government, there was anxiety and I believe that in a way there was a need to get out of the problem and that is why an atmosphere of good deliberations has started. The government's responsibilities have also started, they feel that they cannot remain indifferent.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
That ' s the money for drugs if they go to terrorists .
If the terrorists buy arms from these money
And with the same weapons , a terrorist will stain the breasts of my country ' s soldiers
My country's young will be martyred
Have you ever thought that a mother's red killer, the mother of India's loved one, has been shot in the chest of a soldier for the country, isn't it
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their global progress with our children
Modi ji, do not you get tired
A month is very long .
A lot of events happen in the country and the world .
All of you celebrated Diwali with fervor and enthusiasm .
Festivals are such that from time to time people keep enjoying their lives in life, be it poor, rich, village or city, festivals have their own importance in everyones lives.
Sometimes they think that uit people are useless , people have nothing to do . Our country is like this .
It is very important to change this thinking. Our country is not like this, the people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead, governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps even governments need to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I see that these young people are committed, invited and looking for opportunities, especially for India to do something or the other.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one Khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become Khadi Dhari . But I learned from the Khadi repositors that in a week , around 100 percent of the Hundred and Twenty Five percent sales increased .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from October 2 to October 1 as compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the people of India .
Cleanliness can be imagined that cleanliness will take the form of such a mass movement.
There are plenty of expectations, and should also be.
And I see a good result, cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
An old filth that is filthy, a government machinery, what measures will people sitting in governance do for it
It is a big challenge , but you cannot run away from responsibility .
All governments will have to take steps for this responsibility because public pressure is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect that is very exciting, enjoyable and satisfying the mind. The common man is beginning to feel that let's quit the first thing, will not do dirt anymore.
We ' re not going to blame the new dirt .
I have a mail from Satna, Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bharat Gupta, who sent a mail to my mygov.
He was going to visit his.Railway, his own experience said. He said that I used to go to the railway earlier, this time also I went to the railway but I am seeing that every passenger in the railway keeps eating and drinking, keep throwing paper and paper. The boys did not throw anybody, not only did they find that there is a dustbin in the compartment, put the garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no arrangement in the railways , he himself collected his waste from the corner .
He said this was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharatji for giving me this information .
But I am seeing this that the biggest effect has happened in small children .
Hundreds of families discuss this thing that if our child still eats chocolate somewhere then he will take it off immediately .
I just saw someone in a social media that someone had written. My hero of today and in my hero of today he had given a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country, we will not be dirty.
We don ' t blame the dirt .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, and soon somebody gets them to beat.
I consider this auspicious sign .
It is also a good thing that people from all walks of life meet me these days.
Somebody talks about cleanliness, somebody talks about education, somebody discusses about social reform.
Someone is discussing our family life .
I think , otherwise , if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the Government about his selfishness .
But I see a big change .
They talk about their selfishness less, they talk about taking some responsibilities related to society.
These are the things that I see by adding, I am aware that we are moving forward in the direction of a very good change.
If a poor family of mine is not sick , there will never be any economic crisis in his life .
If he is healthy then he will work hard, earn, family will run.
Therefore, my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we are able to serve the poor better or not, we do not do dirt, nor do we do good to the poor.
I have also seen that those who are working in this field are sending their success stories to me .
But I came to know of two things from my Government .
After my saying the officers of our H . . . ministry felt that we should also do something .
And the officers made a plan together .
See how changes start in government .
On one hand he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give special scholarship to him by enjoying such a thousand good specialty abeld children .
I compliment all the officers of the department for their ideas .
I had the opportunity to visit Siachen in the past .
I spent Diwali in the midst of the dead for the country .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because of them, we are celebrating Diwali, so I went among them.
I have experienced how many difficulties they live in.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another proud thing .
The soldiers of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity by putting a stake in life anyone becomes ready to do any courage to protect us .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity that I had organized a tea programme from the youngsters, youngsters and the winners who had come here in sports.
I got a new energy .
His enthusiasm, enthusiasm, excitement, I saw that our arrangements and facilities were very low compared to other countries, but they were talking about doing more with zeal and enthusiasm rather than complaining.
For me, the programme of tea was very inspiring for these players.
On one hand, I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say it and it's my mind.
And I believe that the countrymen have faith in my words, trust in my intentions.
But once again I want to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your Prime Servant, this is the Article of Faith for me.
This is my commitment that the money that has gone out of India should return to pie-pie.
There may be differences of opinion about what may be the way, what may be the method.
And democracy is natural , but I assure you that we are on the right path , on the basis of my understanding and the knowledge I have .
Today no one is aware of it, neither I know nor the government, neither you nor the previous government knew how much money was left out.
Everyone keeps telling different statistics in their own way.
I don't want to get involved in those figures, my commitment is that there are two rupees, five rupees, crores, billions and billions of trillions. This is the money for the poor of the country and should come back.
And I assure you , there will be no dearth of my efforts .
Nobody will be allowed to do so .
Just keep me blessed.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do it, I will definitely do it.
I assure you that .
I have received a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even though I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this feeling.
They have told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss this drug abuse, this drug mafia and the greatest crisis that India's youthful wealth can be faced next time.
If you have some experience in this regard, if you have some information, if you have saved the children of this addictive habit, if some of your government officials have played a very good role, if you give me such information then I will talk to the countrymen about these good efforts and all of us will create an atmosphere in every family that no child should follow this path because of frustration, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am dealing with topics with which the Government comes first in the dock .
But how long will we hide things 
I am also daring . Because of your love .
I will continue to do so because of your blessings .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were asking us to give suggestions on the face book, give it on Twitter, send an e-mail.
But there are very large sections of the country, who do not have this, what should they do
Your point is correct .
Not everyone has this facility .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then you listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will send a letter to the people, Akashwani, Parliament Street, New Delhi If you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I ' ll take it seriously . Because the active citizen is the largest capital of development .
You write a letter, I mean you're very active.
For the sake of my mind, you should also add to your mind.
Maybe you ' ll write a letter .
I will try to talk to you next month.
My endeavor will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 a.m.
So I ' m going to be able to reach you .
Gradually the beginning of cold is happening .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
Many-many congratulations to all of you on Vijayadashmi.
I will try to talk to you twice a month or once a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk about it, it will be Sunday and the time will be at 11 o'clock then you will also be convenient and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in bringing my thoughts to your mind.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi celebrates this festival of Vijayadashmi is a festival of victory of good over evils.
But a gentleman of Mr. Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent me a mail, he said that in Vijayadashmi we resolve to eliminate the ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for his suggestion.
Everyone would think that by defeating the greater evils within themselves, but as a nation, I feel that on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami, we all resolve to get rid of dirt and attain victory by eliminating dirt, we can make this pledge on the festival of Vijayadashami.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will clean themselves and upload their video to social media and they will invite nine more people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know, our scientists have successfully used to reach Mars in the least cost.
There is no shortage of our strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
Swami Vivekanand Ji used to say one thing that he always used to tell one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up.
He said hey, what are you doing
You're a lion.
They have made me bigger.
Look at my voice, look at the way my conversation is.
So the lion said that let me show who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as he wakes up self-respect from within, he has his own identity, he also started roaming like a lion, a lion in the middle of the sheep.
The essence within him woke up.
Swami Vivekanand Ji used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense power and immense power within 125 crore Indians.
We need to recognize ourselves.
There is a need to recognise the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekanandji had said, we will be victorious if we move ahead with that self-respect, with our right identity and our nation will also be victorious and successful.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps it was a very emotional, inspiring event of my life.
God has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the whole nation.
Later, I had become so emotionally touched that I used to do different Olympics for Special Abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come, I used to go there myself.
And that is why I liked the suggestions of Gautam Pal for which he has given me and I felt like sharing the suggestions that I have received with you.
A story gives me even more attention.
If you knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we dont stand by ourselves, even those who show the way will not meet.
We will not get to hold the finger and run.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that we are capable of running 1. 25 billion rupees, we will continue to do so.
For a few days, many suggestions that come to me, big interesting suggestions send people.
Some people have told me that when they start small industries, the process of registration of them should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have sent me by writing, children should teach skill development from fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, to make arrangements for cleanliness.
Some people have sent me by writing that polyethylene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I tell you from the very front that if you send me a true incident anywhere, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if you send me with evidence then I will definitely talk about Mann Ki Baat, I will surely bring the things that have touched my mind to the countrymen.
All this is the only intention to interact with me. Come, let us all together serve our Mother India.
Let us take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came to my mind today.
Then when I meet, I will meet on Sunday, I will meet at 11 a.m. but I am sure that our journey will continue, your love will remain.
Even if you want to say something to me after listening to me, you must send me, I will like it.
I was very happy to talk to you all today and radio is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach out to the poorest of the poor because the strength of my country is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and youngsters, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
The country will move forward only with your trust.
I express my confidence.
I believe in your power, so I believe in the future of India.
Starting the talk of the mind today is full of mind
10 days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons
These brave heroes, we sacrificed ourselves in the defense of 1. 25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep peacefully, so these brave sons had kept them together day and night.
In Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country, and people have trauma and resentment.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have risen all around
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives in the defense of Mother India.
We all have to face this challenge before the country by forgetting racism, sectarianism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unique courage and valour .
In order to establish peace , where they have shown wonderful ability , the attackers have also been given answers in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
Army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their helpers
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational things that have come out of the media through the media have further strengthened the freshness of the entire country.
Ram Niranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in this hour of grief, the zeal that has been introduced in this hour of grief inspires us all.
They said , They will send their second son to fight the enemies , and if need be , they will fight . 
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also pledged to join his only son
When the body of martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in the tricolor reached Gumla of Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I will also go to the army.
The zeal of this innocent person today expresses the feeling of children and children of India
Similar feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave and brave martyrs.
Our single brave martyr is not an exception, his family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to know and understand the zeal shown by these families.
For what is patriotism, sacrifice and penance, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
In front of our eyes, these are living examples and this is the reason for inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, for such a long time, the war memorial that was waiting for us is going to end now.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen about this is very natural.
On NarendraModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty from Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness on the preparation of National War Memorial.
I was surprised and anguished that there was no National War Memorial in India.
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be such a monument in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on 25th February, millions of our countrymen will deliver this national military monument to our army.
Country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, a new monument has been constructed.
I am sure this will be like going to a national military memorial for the countrymen to a place of pilgrimage
National Sainik Memorial symbolizes the nations gratitude to the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice after Independence
The design of the memorial showcases the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Military Memorial is focused on four concentration circles, where the journey from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom is depicted.
The flame of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier
The second circle is the gallantry cycle that showcases the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
It's a gallery where the bravery of soldiers on the walls has been engraved.
After that, the sacrifice cycle shows the sacrifices of the circle soldiers.
In this the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in the golden letters .
After this the protector cycle displays security
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are giving messages to the citizens of the country assuring that every afternoon soldiers are stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Overall, the National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude, to research them.
Here is the story of the sacrifices that have laid down their lives for the country , so that we may live , that we may preserve and grow .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces in the development of the country
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our view that we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit, share your pictures on social media so that other people get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, for the sake of Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments keep getting me read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comment, I got an interesting comment from Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years old. It is a coincidence that Jamshedji is also the birth anniversary of Tata on March 3.
And he further writes, these two personalities are entirely from two different family backgrounds that enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In the matter of mind , Birsa Munda and Jamshedji are like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way to pay homage to Tata .
These two great personalities have enhanced the name of Jharkhand not the whole country
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then that is Lord Birsa Munda.
The English caught them secretly when they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action 
because the British who created such a big empire were afraid of them
Lord Birsa Munda had shook the British rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows.
Actually, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people on the power of arms is huge.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the dark life of the deprived and the exploited , the sun shines .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 years
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have taken place in every part of the country.
Perhaps there will be a corner of India that no one has contributed to this struggle for centuries of freedom.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, bravery and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize his existence then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave a big institution to the country.
Jamshedji Tata was truly a vision, who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only that, he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 29th.
As you all know , this day comes once in four years .
Easy, peaceful personality rich, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
In independent India the record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai .
Morarji Desai led India in a difficult time when there was a threat to the democratic fabric of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai shook himself in the movement against Emergency to protect democracy
For this he had to pay a heavy price even in old age .
The government of that time arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his tenure only 44th Constitutional Amendment was introduced .
This is important because the 42nd Amendment that was brought during the Emergency, in which there were provisions to reduce the powers of the Supreme Court and others who violated our democratic values were returned.
For example, the 44th Amendment made provision for publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in newspapers.
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored. In this amendment, it was also made that the fundamental rights under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time such arrangements were made that the President would announce the Emergency only on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the period of emergency can not be extended more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which democracy was killed in 1975 by implementing the Emergency could not be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving towards a New India. In this we want to respect those who are doing their jobs at the grass-root level with utmost sincerity.
With their hard work, they are making positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
Indeed, they are true Karmayogi, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and above all in the national service.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I consider it a great success because these people are not on the front page of TV, magazine or newspapers.
These are away from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their names, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : Karmasu Kaushalam lives the message of the Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about some of these people
You must have heard about Odisha's Daitari Nayak, he is not called the Hanal Man of the Disha, the Daitari Nayak cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made a canal for three kilometers. With his hard work, the problem of irrigation and water ended forever.
Take Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional rogan paintings of Kutch.
They ' re doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation
I gave a gift to former US President Barack Obama to the Tree of Life Artwork created by Abdul Gafoor.
Among the recipients of the Padma Awards, Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata
This is unique in itself , just as they spent their entire life in the service of goats .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and the exploited through the Colongium Movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based small financial system
Even at the age of 100, he is training yoga to people all over the world and till now he has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers
Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand, did the courageous work of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites, not only saved 50 hectares of forest from devastating, but also motivated ten thousand women to unite and protect trees and wildlife.
It is a tribute to Jamuna ji's hard work that today, on the birth of every child of the village, 18 trees and 10 trees are planted on the wedding of the girl.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will inspire you, despite being a disabled person, it is difficult to get such an example for the upliftment of women with disabilities. By establishing an institution called Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the holy work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of the farmer aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, i.e. Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring
They have set an example to empower women and make farming profitable.
Kisan Aunt linked 300 women in her area to Self Help Group and inspired them to make economically self-reliant.
He trained the women of the village along with farming and other means of employment. The special thing is that they have done the work of connecting technology with farming. My countrymen, perhaps for the first time it has happened that 12 farmers have received Padma awards in the Padma Awards given this year.
Usually very few people associated with agriculture and very few people who have directly cultivated have come to the list of Padma Shris .
This is a living picture of changing India in itself.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to all of you about a heart-touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going in the country, my effort is to meet the beneficiaries of PM-JAY scheme of Ayushman Bharat.
He was treated with this scheme and he became healthy, the head of the house, the person who took care of his family by working hard and wages was a victim of accident, he was unable to work - this scheme benefited him and he became healthy again, he started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefited from this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change is taking place in the lives of the poor
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment for lack of money , tell him about the scheme .
Separate education boards across the country will start the process for the examination of boards of Class  and II in the next few weeks.
I extend my warm greetings to all the students who take the exams, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a big event to discuss the examinations in Delhi was held in Format, Town Hall.
One of the features of the discussion on the examination was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that can definitely be beneficial for students .
All the students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube, so wish all my exam warriors the very best for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it cant be a matter of India and it cant be a matter of festival.
There is hardly any day in our country that has no significance, which has no festival
Because we have this legacy of thousands of years old culture
After a few days the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday then its special significance is covered in our temple .
He discussed a number of subjects and his self - confidence was really influential - motivational .
During the interaction, when I was talking to an enlightened young man, he said, I am a stage artist, I mimicry in entertainment programmes. So I asked whom do you mimicry
So he told me that I mimicry the prime minister
So I told them to show them a little bit and it was a pleasant surprise for me, so they did a mimicry of the way I talk about Mann Ki Baat and did a mimicry of Mann Ki Baat.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to the mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really impressed by the power of that Divyang young man .
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to join you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through radio , I ' m going to have millions of families every month
Sometimes I feel like you have taken me as a part of your family while talking to all of you, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone.
This has been a very pleasant experience for me .
Friends, election is the biggest celebration of democracy
Next two months, we will all be busy in the gambling of elections
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and in the month of May, all these three months of our emotions will be started with the strength of your blessings after the election and once again I will start my conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will continue to talk to you about Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Shri Sivakumar Swami ji, doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math in Tumkur district of Karnataka has not been among us
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakav Kailas is like performing his duties while working hard, it is like being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham.
His fame was in the form of a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He spent his entire life in the fact that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
Be it welfare of the farmers in every way, it was a priority in the life of Swami ji.
Siddhaganga Math regularly organizes animal and agricultural fairs .
I have often got the privilege of receiving the blessings of the supreme lord Swami ji
In 2007, on the occasion of the centenary year celebrations of Shri Shivkumar Swami ji, our former President, Dr. A.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for Swamiji on this occasion .
This poem by Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
ECI was the foundation day on 25th January, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, National Footers Day.
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countryman to be proud of the Election Commission by seeing the good conduct of our Election Commission.
No effort is left in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote
When they hear these things, it is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
Keeping in mind that one voter, that voter gets an opportunity to use his franchise, the entire team of EC employees goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting - that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel, other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time that young people born in the 21st century will use their votes in Lok Sabha elections.
There is an opportunity for them to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to be part of the decision making process in the country
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote together - these feelings should flourish within us
For any reason in life, if you can not vote then there should be a big pain
Sometimes there should be some misery in the country .
I urge the well-known celebrities of the country to collectively create awareness among the people about whether to vote on the day of polling or not.
I hope a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some amazing, unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is polygamous
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I got the privilege of inaugurating a Museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed so far from freedom within the Red Fort.
Those closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and ICAI.
Museum dedicated to the Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history lies.
The stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the rocks of the museum inspire us to go within history.
At the same place, the brave sons of Bharat Maa Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were tried by the British.
When I was seeing memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, then I was presented a very special cap, cap by Netaji's family members.
Netaji used to wear the same hat
I kept the cap in the museum, so that the people coming there also look at the cap and take inspiration from it for patriotism.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of our heroes needs to be constantly conveyed to the new generation.
Just a month ago on 30 December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it is the tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizer
a brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle
Come to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with vibrant slogans
For many years it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this thing.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family had come to the Prime Minister's residence
We together talked a lot about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar
If you come to Delhi , you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and that too in mind, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered radio as an important means of connecting with people. Likewise, Netaji had a very deep relationship with the radio and he had chosen radio to interact with the countrymen.
I was told that this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The programmes being broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the masses and their programmes gave a lot of strength to the warriors of our freedom struggle.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir .
This has been an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
There are 4 historical ehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
The museum exhibits excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avniendra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you must be wondering that the talk is happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
You have yet to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not name most of his work
He believed that the person who saw his painting himself understood that painting, let the message given by him in the painting go from his point of view.
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America
I hope you ' re going to see their paintings in the Kranti Mandir
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
There was such a saint - Saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on 19th February
The dohas of Saint Ravidas ji are very famous
Saint Ravidas ji used to give the greatest message through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in the caste, which can not be added to the feet of Ketan, unless the caste is split, then the leaf under the leaf and finally there is nothing left under the leaf, but the whole tree is over, in the same way the person has also been divided into castes and not a human being.
They used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not right to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas Ji through his messages tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of labour prestige to the world
He used to say , ' Mana Changa ' , ' Ganga ' in Kathauti , if your mind and heart are sacred , then God is in your heart .
The messages of Saint Ravidas Ji have influenced every section, every section of the people, be it the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Mirabai, all were his followers.
I once again bow down to Saint Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
They also want me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching space.
The Kalam set created by our students on January 24 has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
The number of space missions that have taken place since independence till 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft
We will soon register India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect our lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technology is getting a lot of help in all these.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their safety as well as economic growth.
We are using space technology to further improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Housing for All means Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been geo-tagged in this scheme.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It has a major contribution in our better relations with many countries of the world .
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through its very competitive launch services, India today launches satellites not only of developing countries but also of developed countries.
Sky and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the limits which were considered impossible so far.
This is a vision for our children to keep watching stars and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that all the youngsters and young sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India this time.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strengthened i. e.
This time players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is a tremendous inspiration .
They live in a parking shed with their family
Maharashtra's Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team captain Sonali Helvi is a resident of Satara
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali's skills
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi
Despite this, Sonali chose kabaddi and performed excellently
Asansol's 10 year old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
Akshata Baswani Kamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka won gold medal in weightlifting
He credited his victory to his father, his father is a farmer in Belgaum
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is the resolve of the youth power that is New India.
These stories of Khelo India are telling us that not only the people of big cities have contributed in the construction of New India but they also contribute a lot to the youth, children and sporting talents coming from small towns, villages and towns.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the prestigious beauty contest.
But have you heard about the toilet polishing contest 
Over 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique contest that lasted for nearly a month.
The name of this unique contest is clean beautiful toilets
People are making their toilets clean and colorful and paintings and making them beautiful. You will also get to see the beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, on the entire photos social media.
I invite all Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in my Panchayat
Share your clean beautiful toilet photo with MylatGhar on social media .
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and free from open defecation.
In collaboration with the people of India, India is moving towards Open Defecation Free long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The audience of Mann Ki Baat has contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And that is why you are happy to share that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and Swachhta Coverage in rural India has crossed 98 and toilets have been provided to nearly nine crore households.
My young friends, the days of the examinations are coming.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and am arrriors
Anshul ji, thank you for raising this issue
Yes, for many families the first part of the year is Ham Season.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all people are busy working on examinations.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers
I would certainly like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but you would be happy to know that I am going to interact with students from all over the country at 11.00 am on 29th January, along with students and participants, parents and teachers will also be part of this programme.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this program
I will talk to my young friends about all aspects related to the examinations, especially the stress free exam, in this examination.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas for this.
And I am very happy that a large number of people at MyGov are sharing their views
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall programme .
You must be part of this program. You can also see its live telext through social media and Namo app.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock the whole country pays homage to the martyrs
Wherever we are, pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes
Remember the virtue of revered Bapu and fulfilling the dreams of revered Bapu, building a New India, fulfilling his duties as a citizen, come forward with this resolution.
Successfully carry this visit of 2019
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
This is where he performed his steadfastness towards justice .
I would like to say today that one thing that touches my mind in the matter of mind is that when we listen to the minds of all the people of the family then it seems that the head of our family is sharing our own words with us when I have heard this thing in detail that I am very satisfied that I am amongst you, I am amongst you, you have made me bigger, and in a way I will continue to come here again and again as a member of your family, I will continue to connect with you, I will continue to share your happiness and sorrow, my aspirations, my ambitions, my ambitions, my ambitions, I am very happy that I am amongst you, I am amongst you, I thank you for this journey.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
You will be happy to know that this award for best policy making in this sector is similar to the scar in that area. Not only this, our Sikkim won this award by overcoming 51 Nominated Policies of 25 countries and I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing. My dear countrymen, it is also at the end of October. There has been a lot of changes in the weather and the days of the winter have started with the change of season.
