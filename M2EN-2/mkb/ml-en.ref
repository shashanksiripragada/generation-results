Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
On the pious festival of Deepawali, greetings to all of you.
These days Diwali is celebrated across many countries.
And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour.
In a way, they nurture a microcosm of India at their respective places.
Friends, festival tourism has its own exciting attractions.
Here, every state, every region is replete with distinct festivals, generating a lot of interest in people from other countries.
Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting festival tourism in India .
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different this Diwali.
I had urged all of you to celebrate Indias Nari-Shakti, the power and achievement of women, thereby felicitating the Lakshmi of India.
And within no time, there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh from Warangal has written on Namo App-My mother is my strength.
In 1990, when my father expired, the responsibility to raise five sons fell on her shoulders.
Today, all five brothers are doing well in their respective professions.
Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her, Major Khushbu Kanwar, daughter of a bus conductor, who has led an all women contingent of Assam Rifles, is the Lakshmi of India.
For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength.
She is proud of her daughters excellent painting ability.
She has also secured a good rank in the CLAT exam.
Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92 year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances.
One feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself.
You will notice the beauty of word, sentiment and thought in this poem in Kannada: (Penninda permegondanu himavantanu.
Penninda broohu perchidanuPenninda janakaraayanu jasuvalendanu) Which means, Himwant, Lord Mount attained fame on account of daughter Parvati, Rishi Brighu on account of his daughter Lakshmi and King Janak because of daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride...
their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th of November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakashotsav of Guru Nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat.
He stood firm against social ills such as untouchability.
Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world.
He was the widest travelled of those times.
And wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Ji undertook many significant spiritual journeys called Udaasi.
Carrying the message of harmony and equality, he travelled north, south, east and west, meeting people, saints and sages.
It is said that the revered Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him.
He also went to Buddhist holy sites such as Rajgir and Gaya.
His journeys to the south took him to Sri Lanka, as well.
During his Yatra to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with.
Gurunanak Jhira Sahib is a famous place in Bidar dedicated to him, cherishing reminiscences of him.
During one Udaasi, Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas.
This forged a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet where people accorded him the status of a Guru.
He is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited.
During one Udaasi, he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He secured a revered place in the hearts of millions who followed his messages with complete devotion, a practice that continues even in the present times.
Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of approximately eighty-five countries went to Amritsar from Delhi.
There in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan, commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Besides Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about Sikh traditions and culture.
Following that, many Ambassadors shared those photos on social media, writing about their glorious experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of October.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the unifying force in bonding us as a Nation
On the one hand Sardar Patel, possessed the rare quality of uniting people on the other, he was able to strike a balance with people who were not in ideological agreement with him.
Sardar Patel used to observe even the minutest of things in-depth
He was a 'Man of Detail' in the true sense of the term.
Along with that, he was also adept at organising skills.
Chalking out plans and devising strategies was his core forte'.
When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of working, we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness in his planning.
In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad, thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate.
Sardar Patel was entrusted with overlooking all the arrangements.
He utilized this opportunity in improving the citys water supply network.
He ensured that not a single person would face a problem on account of water.
He contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags.
These were made and sold to the delegates.
They carried the bags with their shoes inside, free from any tension of the footwear getting stolen.
On the other hand, it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi.
Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly.
He strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, all of us know that as Indias first home minister, Sardar Patel undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states.
Scrutinizing the minutest of events closely was his rare quality.
Soon after Partition in 1947, our neighbour had cast an eye on Lakshadweep a ship bearing their flag was sent there.
When Sardar Patel was informed of this, he wasted no time in initiating stern action.
He urged the Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swamy Mudaliar to immediately undertake a mission with people of Travancore to Lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the Tricolour there.
Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated within no time.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in Indias progress.
It is an attractive tourist destination too.
I hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
It is the tallest statue in the world.
It is double in height compared to the 'Statue of Liberty' located in the US.
The distinction of having the world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride
the head of every Indian is held high.
You will be happy to note that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists visited the 'Statue of Unity'.
The locals have now started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and I am sure that it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for our nation and the constituent states, as well as for the tourism industry, this 'Statue of Unity' can be a subject of research.
We are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination.
People arrive there from the country and abroad.
And one after the other, ancillary services like transport, lodging, guides and eco-friendly services are getting inducted by themselves.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, which Indian will not be imbued with pride for the fact that recently, Time magazine has included the Statue of Unityin its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the world.
Of course I hope, that all of you will devote some of your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity.
But my appeal is, that every Indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 Tourist Destinations of India with family and experience a night stay at whichever place you go to
Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'.
This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
On 31st October, this year too Run for Unity is being organized in consonance with previous years.
It will include people from all walks of life, from every segment of our society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of unison, that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and collectively aims for- One goal
Anyway, at present, people have adopted and found a passion for the marathon.
Run for Unity is also one such unique provision.
Running is beneficial for the mind, body and soul.
And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights
And so, in whichever city you reside, you can find out about the Run for Unity schedule.
I hope you will all run on October 31st not only for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison.
My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony.
But sometimes it so happens, that the efforts of the society and its contribution, get wiped from our collective memory.
Various kinds of people took to the arena
Various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way
The kind of language that was spoken in order to generate tension in the atmosphere
There was also an attempt to instill shrillness in the tone of different speakers.
Some of the loudmouths and the braggarts had the sole intention of hogging the spotlight at that time.
And whenever I do that, I get happy that the dignity of the judiciary was very proudly honoured and no allowance for any heated discourse or tension was made anywhere.
These incidents should always be remembered as they impart us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment, instills in us all a sense of duty.
It is an example of how the voice of unison can bestow strength upon our country.
It was a traumatic moment for our country.
Today, I pay homage to her too.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and sanitation.
Every person, every family, every village wants to narrate their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission, because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore Indians.
The outcome also belongs to 125 crore Indians.
But therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too.
I heard it and I think, I will share it with you too.
Just imagine the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature drops from zero to 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen in the air is also at a miniscule level.
Living in the midst of such adverse conditions and challenges is not less than any display of valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but are also running a Swacch Siachen campaign in that arena.
We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially during Diwali, it is customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity.
I had once said that we should try to buy local products.
There is no need to go to the tehsil if our need is met in our village.
If it is found in Tehsil, then there is no need to go to the district.
The more we try to buy our local things the 'Gandhi 150' will become a great event in itself.
And I keep insisting that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers, our khadi artisans.
Hence along with the best of wishes on Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local.
And witness for ourselves, how we can play an important role in making Mahatma Gandhi's dream come alive.
But, sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness.
An injury can also occur.
I urge all of you to take utmost care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I extend many felicitations to you.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There must be hardly any Indian who doesnt feel proud of our Armed Forces, our army jawans, our soldiers.
Every Indian, irrespective of region, caste, religion, sect or language, is ever eager to express joy and show solidarity with our soldiers.
Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the Paraakram Parva, the festival of Valour.
We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism.
At various places in the country, exhibitions have been organised by our Armed Forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens, especially the younger generation, of the might we possess
how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens.
A day such as Paraakaram Prava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our Army.
It also inspires us to maintain the unity integrity of the country.
I too participated in a programme held at Jodhpur in the land of the valiant, Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our Nation.
India has always been resolutely committed to peace.
In the two world-wars fought in the 20th century, over a lakh of our soldiers made the Supreme Sacrifice
that too in a war where we were not involved in any way.
This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel.
For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.
My dear countrymen, the sky offers the rarest of hues.
We celebrate Air Force Day on the 8th of October.
From the core of my heart, I congratulate those Air Warriors and their families who rendered service to the nation.
In 1947, when Pakistani attackers resorted to an unprecedented attack, it was indeed our Air Force which ensured that Indian Soldiers and armaments reached the battlefield promptly.
The Air Force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too.
Who does not know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971
The Air Force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating Kargil from their clutches.
The Air Force defeated the enemy at Tiger Hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock.
Be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management, our country is indebted to our Air Force for the commendable efforts of our Air Warrior.
Indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces, our Army not only man-power but woman-power too is contributing equally.
The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy.
You know, Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous, brave soldier.
He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was moving ahead in South Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble.
Yet, this brave heart from the Navy kept struggling for many days in mid-ocean.
He fought to be afloat without food or drink.
He did not accept defeat and continued to fight death.
A rare example of courage, determination, strength and bravery a few days ago I talked to Abhilash over the telephone after he was rescued and brought safely ground.
I pray for Tomys sound health and I am sure that his courage, bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation.
The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis philosophy has inspired the whole world.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu, put forth his ideas on various subjects like Farmers, villages, securing of labour rights, cleanliness and promoting of education.
This is also known as the Gandhi Charter.
Revered Babu was a peoples person.
Getting connected with people or connecting people with him was Bapus special quality, this was in his nature.
Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality.
He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country.
His biggest contribution in the Freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive Jan-Aandolan (Peoples Movement).
During the Freedom Struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at Mahatma Gandhis call.
In that, Gandhiji had said, I give you one mantra, whenever you are in doubt or whenever your ego gets over your personality, undergo this test
Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis mantras is very relevant event today.
The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power
can we remember revered Bapu for a moment while going out for shopping
Can we remember that mantra of Bapu
Can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase
Whose face will sport a smile
Who will be the fortunate one to get a direct or indirect benefit from your purchase
I will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that by maintaining cleanliness, freedom will be won then he probably was not aware how this would happen.
But this did happen and India got freedom.
In the same way today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution I may be contributing in a big way to help in the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle against poverty by lending strength to the poor.
I feel that this is true patriotism, and a perfect tribute to revered Bapus work.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to preserve old and worn out Khadi clothes because some ones labour could be felt in the making of those clothes.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes have been woven after putting in a hard labour, every thread of these clothes must be utilized.
This spirit of attachment towards the country and fellow countrymen was deeply imbibed in that great person of a very short physical stature.
Two days later, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with respected Bapus birth anniversary.
The very name of Shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us, Indians.
His mild persona always fills every Indian with a sense of pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji had a unique quality in that, he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside.
His slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is the hall mark of his grand personality.
It was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success.
On the 15th of September, people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement.
If you had not made a call about this aspect, perhaps those connected with this cleanliness movement might have also not thought about such a sensitive issue.
I specially thank you for your phone call.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of Bapus 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.
My dear countrymen, there is a Sanskrit quote- U k
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the 'National Human Rights Commission' (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993.
A few days later NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years.
Our most beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us.
In its journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen.
For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event.
Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and inculcate them into practice - this is the very basis of Sab ka SaathSab ka Vikas'.
My dear countrymen, the month of October heralds, Jai Prakash Narayan ji's birth anniversary, the beginning of the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindiaji.
These luminaries have been infusing inspiration in all of us and we offer our heartfelt tributes to them.
31 October happens to be the birth anniversary of Sardar sahib, I shall dwell upon his birth anniversary in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I want to mention that for the past few years, the occasion of Sardar Sahibs birth anniversary on October 31 is marked in every small town and district by organizing the 'Run for Unity' race.
Even this year, we should try to organize 'Run for Unity' in our village, town, city or metropolis.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb, because he worked for the unity of our nation throughout his lifetime.
I urge you all that on October 31, through 'Run for Unity', to strengthen our efforts and bind every section of the society as a unified unit.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love trust between a brother a sister.
For centuries, this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony.
In the nations history, there are innumerable accounts of this sacred thread, binding together people of distant lands, different religions, around a spindle of trust.
In a few days from now, we shall celebrate the festive occasion of Janmashtami.
Heartiest greetings to all countrymen on the festive occasions of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Poornima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those actively involved in preserving conserving this glorious heritage, helping it to reach out to the masses.
We Indians also feel proud that from Vedic times to the modern day, Sanskrit language has played a stellar role in the universal spread of knowledge.
You will be pleased to know that even today, residents of village Mattur in Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit as their lingua franca.
And that is why the minutest nuance of an expression or subject can be accurately described.
And since there is a sense of geographical cultural belonging, they are easy to understand assimilate.
For example, in order to illustrate the significance of the Guru in ones life, it has been said : r - , u.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teacher Day across the country.
I felicitate all the teachers in the country on this occasion.
I also salute your sense of commitment towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon comes along, bringing a new ray of hope to our toiling farmers.
It provided much needed succor to the scorched trees shrubs, and to parched water bodies
on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods.
Its a vagary of Nature that some places have received higher rainfall compared to other places.
We just saw how the terrible floods in Kerala have affected human lives.
In todays pressing, hard times, the entire Nation is with Kerala.
Our sympathies are with those families who lost their loved ones.
Loss of lives cannot be compensated, but I assure the grief-stricken families that in this moment of suffering misery, a hundred twenty five crore Indians stand by them, shoulder to shoulder.
I earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon.
I firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the state will see Kerala rise again.
Disasters, unfortunately leave behind a trail of destruction.
But one gets to witness facets of humanity, humaneness during disasters.
From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy.
Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing.
Everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in Kerala are going through, in fact sharing their pain.
We know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue relief operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
I was looking into the suggestions received for Mann Ki Baat.
The subject about which most of the people from across the country have written is Our revered Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar and numerous others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking me to speak on various aspects of Ataljis life.
As soon as the people in our country and abroad heard of the demise of Atalji on 16th August, everyone drowned in sadness.
He was a leader who gave up his position as Prime Minister fourteen years ago.
In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years.
He was neither seen in the news nor in public life.
Ten years is a huge gap but on 16th August our country and the whole world witnessed that there was not a gap of even a single moment in the common mans heart.
The wave of love and faith that spread across the nation is an indicator of his great personality.
India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in Indias politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15 of the total seats in the state Assembly.
And the second one is that the limit under the Anti Defection Law was enhanced from one-thirds to two-thirds.
Besides, clear guidelines were defined to disqualify the defector.
For many years in India, the political culture of forming a very large cabinet was being misused to constitute jumbo cabinets not only to create a divide but also to appease political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
This effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources.
This also helped in improving efficiency.
It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity.
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
Earlier, as was the British tradition, the Budget used to be presented at 5 pm because in London, Parliament used to start working at that time.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
One more freedom- the Indian Flag Code was framed in Ataljis tenure and it came into effect in 2002.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
This is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy.
I must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, encouraging open-minded debates would also be a appropriate tribute to Atalji.
Reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I along with all of you pay tributes to Atalji.
The monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days back.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon session most productive and this is why Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and in Rajya Sabha fourteen bills were passed.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important bills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SCST commission was long pending for decades.
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers.
This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
An amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
This will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities.
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice towards the woman-power of the country.
The nation will not tolerate those committing rapes.
With this point in view Parliament has made a provision of strictest punishment by passing the Criminal Act Amendment Bill.
Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
The Triple Talaq Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha although it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha, I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands by them to provide them social justice.
Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs.
The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
Every morning, first of all, people look for newspapers, Television, News and Social Media to check Indian players winning medals.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
Among those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign
so much so, that youngsters of only 15-16 years of age have brought honour to our country by winning medals.
This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well.
Many good wishes to you all on the National Sports Day.
Namaste Bhawnaji, I respect your sentiments.
All of us have seen houses and buildings being constructed of bricks and stones but can you imagine that about twelve hundred years ago, a giant mountain which was a single stone mountain was give the shape of an elegant, huge and a unique temple this may be difficult to imagine, but this happened and that temple is Kailash Nath Mandir in Ellora, Mahrashtra.
But, Brihdeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of Engineering and Architecture can be seen.
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
He was Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
He is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard.
In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their own identity in the world.
While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well.
Workshops should be held at different places.
Nowadays, disaster management has assumed immense significance.
The world is facing natural calamities.
What then should be the new form of structural engineering
How do we make zero waste our priority
All such points need to be pondered upon when we observe Engineers Day.
We shall meet.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
The vastness and diversity of India, in fact, at times even rains play hide seek through partiality laced likes dislikes.
But why should we blame the rains
V...
in Thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
Their exit was completely blocked. Not able to find a way out, they perched themselves a top a mound inside the cave not for a day or two, but an entire 18 days.
One can only imagine the predicament of these teenagers in the face of death, where every second was fraught with danger.
On the one hand they were struggling against all odds on the other, the world over, humanity joined hands in expressing the noblest the most righteous of human virtues.
The world over, people prayed for the safe secure exit of these children.
Anyway, the good news of their safe exit spread a sigh of relief, a sense of inner calm.
But I feel like viewing the entire sequence of events from another perspective, i.
All of them came together as a team to accomplish their mission.
I feel the self-control exercised by each one of them in conduct is worth understanding and emulating.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
The whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience, without losing hope, despite the odds against them in the water-logged dark cave.
This proves that when humanity stands together, it creates wonders.
it was a combination of hope, faith, a firm resolve and self-confidence.

Usually, the months of July and August are very important for farmers and the youth.
This is the time which is Peak season for colleges.
Like Satyam, Hundreds of thousands of youth leave schools to join colleges.
Whereas February and March get consumed in exams, papers and answers, April May are meant for enjoying vacations, followed by results and thereafter, shaping a course for ones life through career choices.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of ones village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of ones life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
Some students might have joined their respective colleges and some must be about to join.
All I would like to say to you is Be calm, enjoy life, seek inner happiness in life.
There is no alternative to books, one has to study, yet ones bent of mind should be towards discovering new things.
Old friends are invaluable.
Childhood friends are precious, but selecting, making maintaining new friendships is a task that requires immense prudence.
Keep learning something new, such as newer skills and languages.
how Asharam Choudhury a student from an extremely poor family in Madhya Pradesh overcame lifes many challenges to achieve success.
There are many such instances of students from deprived families who, through sheer determination perseverance overcame all odds and stood out to be beacons of inspiration to others.
Examples such as Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a DTC bus driver, Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied on foothpaths under street lights, Bitiya Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father drives an auto rickshaw, Nagpurs daughter Khushi, whose father is a school bus driver, Karthik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand, whose father is a brick-kiln labourer...
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any commendable incident from any part of the country infuses my heart with energy and inspires me.
It so happened that once I was interacting with Indian youth in San Jose town of America hailed as a Technology Hub.
I had appealed to those young people to think over how could they use their talent to Indias benefit and do something in that direction whenever they found time.
I had made an appeal to change brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two IT Professionals from Rae Bareilly Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my challenge and made a unique attempt.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of the village Taudhakpur in Rae Bareilly, village chief, District Magistrate, CDO and every one joined in to create awareness amongst the masses.
This App is actually bringing in a Digital Revolution in the village, with the help of this App, it has since become easier to record, track and monitor developmental work being done in the village.
This App contains phone directory, News section, events list, health centre and information centre of the village.
This App is very useful for the farmers and the grammar feature of the App and FACT rate among the farmers functions like a market place for their products.
If you look into this incident minutely, one thing will strike you and that is the young man living in America adhering to that countrys life-style and ideology, who left India many years ago but, knows the finer details about his village, knows about the challenges and still is emotionally attached to his village.
But, sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distance and at times because of situations that spirit gets faded but just with a touch of a tiny spark, everything re-emerges which takes one back to old memories.
Santoshji, many - many thanks for your phone call.
Actually, Pandharpur Wari is an amazing journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which fell on 23rd July, is celebrated as a day of grand transformation of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy town in Solapur district in Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi warkari or pilgrims start the Pandharpur Yatra on foot.
This yatra (journey) is known as Wari and lakhs of warkaris join this.
Pilgrims go to have a darshan of Vitthal who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor, the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana have deep devotion and respect for Vitthal.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself.
I request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to visit Pandharpur Wari at least once, whenever they get a chance.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Dass, Tukaram are relevant even today in educating the masses.
They are imparting energy to fight against superstition in each and every corner across the country.
May they be compositions like Bharud (Hkk:M) or Abhang (vHkax), we get a great message of amity, love and brotherhood.
We get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind-faith through devotion and bhakti.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
He had the courage to show a mirror to the British about their wrong doings.
The British were so afraid of Lok Manya Tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades
this is no small thing.
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When in October 1916, Lok Manya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people that time gave him a welcome and during that very visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a chance to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was greatly impressed by Lok Manya Tilakji.
The British were naturally not happy with this and the collector continually kept denying permission.
But Sardar Saheb was also Sardar Saheb after all, he was persistent and had remarked that he might have to give up on his post but Lok Manya Tilakjis statue would certainly be built there.
Finally, the statue got built and Sardar Saheb got it unveiled by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929
Tradition of publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav was also initiated with the efforts of Lok Manya Tilakji.
The celebration of Ganesh Utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening, integration, amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them.
This was the period when there was a need for people to get united in the fight against the British
Thus, it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past, its heritage and history.
Today, you can see Ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities.
This is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves.
Right from Ganesh idol to all decorative material everything ought to be eco friendly and I will appreciate that separate competitions be organized in each city, prizes be awarded for these
I will surely send your ideas and efforts to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak evoked self- confidence amongst our countrymen and gave the slogan Swaraj is our birth right and I shall have it.
Today is the time to say that Good Governance is our birth right and we will have it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and positive results of development.
It is the factoring in of this outreach that will create a new India.
After 50 years of Tilak's birth, on the same day i. e.
on July 23, another son of Mother India was born, who sacrificed his life so that his countrymen could breathe freely in an atomsphere of freedom.
I am talking about none other than Chandrasekhar Azad.
Where will you find a young man in India who will not be inspired listening to these lines -Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mein hai Dekhna hai zor kitna baazu-e-qaatil mein hai(The desire for martyrdom is now in our heartsLet us see the strength in the arms of my executioner) These lines inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and many others.
Azads courage and passion for freedom inspired the youth of the day.
Chandrashekhar Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta Bhyan, another daughter of the country, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
Ekta in her e-mail writes - 'The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he or she holds the tricolor and I am proud that I could do that.
' Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have brought glory to the Nation.
Ekta has won the gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 held in Tunisia.
I salute Ekta Bhyanji, Yogesh athuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji, all of you for your fortitude and passion, and congratulate you
I wish all of you best wishes for good health, for this month of August imbued with the spirit of patriotism and for many festivals that have continued over centuries.
We will meet once again for Mann Ki Baat' next time.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams performed par excellence.
Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year.
I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghanis words on Twitter tagging me along The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan.
Im also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan.
The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world.
The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs.
I felicitate both the teams of India Afghanistan.
I sincerely hope, that in future too, well play with each other with the best sportsman spirit shine together.
My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights.
The whole world appeared as one entity.
On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison.
Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people.
ealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival.
If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over
It is a matter of great pride for a hundred twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea sky.
A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same.
Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth.
Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues.
Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries.
Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets yoga has proved them in a concrete manner.
More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctors Day, the 1st of July.
You are absolutely right.
We think of doctors only during times of distress.
But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society.
The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments.
they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health.
Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills.
Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems.
Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctors Day on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India.
India has had a rich historical canvas.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th.
Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar
In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in ones pathway to heaven.
On the contrary, breathing ones last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven.
Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view.
They are relevant inspiring even in modern times.
I quote a doha , , The true saint is the one who recognizes understands the sufferings of others.
Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate.
In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace harmony.
He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences.
His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.
And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries.
Guru Nanak Devs teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society.
Guru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour.
To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride.
There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab.
In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity.
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on 'Narendra Modi Mobile App' that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much, Raman ji.
Dr.
Very few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla.
This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for Indias industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform.
The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee's dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.
He had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry.
For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950.
There was also a special emphasis by Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life.
Come
People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements.
In far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers.
Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages.
At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur
And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people.
Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their schools tinkering lab.
There are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite.
In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government's credit.
An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people.
With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more.
There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and youre left with renewed fervour and inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.
We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness.
In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination.
This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
On one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers' participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right.
A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest.
Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank.
I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.
My dear countrymen Its been an year when GST was implemented.
'One Nation, One Tax' was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.
These meetings involve representatives of different states states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus.
Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.
In the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector.
Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology.
GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world.
The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme.
It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar.
I want to tell you something about the Naavika Saagar Parikrama.
These six illustrious daughters of India circumnavigated the globe for over more than 250 days on board the INSV Tarini, returning home on the 21st of May.
The entire country welcomed them with open arms, with high spirits.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the world that Indias daughters are no less.
Who does not know of the sense of adventure
If you view the journey of human evolution, you will notice that breakthroughs in progress have taken birth in the womb of some adventure or the other.
There is an umbilical link between development and adventure
On the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the worlds highest peak.
These Ashram School students began training in August, 2017, covering Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh.
These young boys girls had been selected under Mission Shaurya.
True to its name, they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the Everest.
I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart.
Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side.
I congratulate these daredevils, especially the daughters from the core of my heart.
they are tagging each other to spread the challenge.
Everybody is now getting connected with this Fit India Campaign.
People from the film fraternity, from the world of Sports, common citizens of the country, members of the armed forces, school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms, their rising notes are building up a crescendo Hum Fit toh India Fit...
If we are fit, India is fit.
For me, its heartwarming that the captain of the Indian Cricket team Virat Kohli ji has included me in his challenge...
I believe this is gainful and this kind of a challenge will inspire us to be fit along with others, as well.
My dear countrymen, many a time in Mann Ki Baat, you must have heard me mention a thing or two about sports sportspersons.
And in the last episode, our heroes of the Commonwealth Games shared with us their Mann Ki Baat, matters close to their hearts through this programme.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports games that were once a part parcel of every childs life, in every lane in the neighbourhood, are fading into oblivion.
These games used to be a special feature of summer holidays.
Sometimes in scorching afternoons at times after dinner, children used to play with exuberant abandon for hours together, leaving all worries behind.
outdoor and indoor as well.
The unity, intrinsic to our countrys diversity can be witnessed in these games.
A single game is known by distinct names at different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I known of a game played in Gujarat called Chomal Isto.
It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
It used to be played in almost every state.
Known as Chowkabara in Karnataka, Attoo in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakaali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Daayaam and Thaayaam in Tamilnadu, Changaa Po in Rajasthan, it had innumerable names.
One realizes after playing, despite not knowing the language of a particular state, Oh
We used to play this game in our state as well
Who amongst us would not have enjoyed playing Gilli-Danda in our childhood
This is a game that is played across villages and cities.
It is also known by different names.
In Andhra Pradesh it is called Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Odisha its called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra, Vittidaaloo.
Some games are seasonal.
There is a season for flying kites.
While flying a kite or playing a game, one freely expresses ones inherent unique qualities.
while playing, the innate child within them comes to the fore.
Traditional sports and games are structured in such a manner that along with physical ability, they enhance our logical thinking, concentration, alertness and energy levels.
At the same time, we also come to know about our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about our society, environment and other spheres.
Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games.
This time the theme is 'Beat Plastic Pollution'.
I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health.
Let us all visit the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.
Whenever we face a torrid summer, or floods, incessant rains or unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, analyzing global warming and climate change.
But does empty talk bring about any solutions
These calamities are basically the result of the change in weather patterns.
Our culture, our traditions have never taught us to be at loggerheads with nature.
We have to live in harmony and in synchronicity with nature, we have to stay in touch with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life.
Today when India speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can we progress in this direction
What innovative things can we do
The rainy season is fast approaching
The news being received these days is that there are preparations afoot in the whole world to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.
Yoga for unity and a harmonious society conveys a message that has permeated the world over.
The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father.
When so many attributes become one's partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today is the 27th of May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I render my pranam to Pandit ji.
Memories of this month are also linked with Veer Savarkar.
This was the very month, the month of May 1857, when Indians had displayed their strength against the British.
It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First War of Independence.
Savarkar jis personality was full of special qualities
But besides these sterling qualities, he was also a striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
Savarkar marched along with both poetry and revolution.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a courageous revolutionary.
They have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved despite all odds
And this is not only about Sikar, but in every corner of India, you will witness something akin to this.
If you observe in your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues.
These discussions are also political and social in nature, can be about movies, sports and sportspersons or can focus even on the problems of the country any problem with probable solutions are discussed at length but often the problems and their solutions remain limited to such animated discussions only.
today you will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts.
He has opened a school named 'Asha Ashvaasan', spending 50 of his income for children living in slums and hutments.
He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school.
I congratulate D.
Prakash Rao for his hard work, his persistence and for providing a new direction to the lives of those poor children attending his school.
He has banished the darkness from their lives.
Your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings.
There must be innumerable incidents.
Come, let us take positivity forward.
People will wait for the moon in a few days from now onwards.
I hope and believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with gaiety and fervor and on this occasion children will specially get a grand Eidi.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Heartiest felicitations to all of you.
My dear countrymen, many thanks to you all.
We shall meet once again in another episode of Mann Ki Baat next month.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia.
71 countries, including India, participated therein.
With an event of such scale magnitude, which saw the participation of thousands of sportspersons from myriad corners of the world, can you imagine the mood that must have pervaded the atmosphere there
An air of excitement, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations, the determination to achieve who would want to stay away from an atmosphere like that
Shooting or Wrestling, Table Tennis or Badminton, it was a record performance for India.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze, India bagged a tally of around 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian swell with pride.
It is a wave of emotions that engulfs all of us simultaneously.
Perhaps, to express those sentiments Ill run short of words.
But I want to share with you what I heard from these heroes.
At the same time, it was special.
Are you aware that out of the wrestlers who represented India, each one of them returned with a medal
Manika Batra won a medal in each of the events that she competed in.
She is the first Indian woman to win a gold in the individual table tennis category too.
India clinched the maximum number of medals in shooting.
15 year old Indian shooter Anish Bhanwala became the youngest sportsperson to win a gold for India.
Sachin Chowdhary is the sole Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
This edition of the games was special on one more count- a majority of the medalists was women athletes.
In squash, boxing, weightlifting and shooting the performance of women turned out to be par excellence.
The final contest in Badminton took place between two Indian Shuttlers, Saina Nehwal and P.
Sindhu.
Everyone was thrilled for the fact that despite there being competition, the ultimate medal winner had to be India.
Athletes who participated in these games hail from various parts of the country, even from smaller towns.
Even their friends have contributed by boosting their morale under all circumstances.
Last month during Mann Ki Baat, I had urged our countrymen, especially the youth to espouse Fit India.
I had invited everyone to join Fit India, lead Fit India.
I was overjoyed to see people getting connected to it with a lot of enthusiasm.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Dhawal Prajapati, sharing a photograph of himself trekking, has written For me, travelling trekking is Fit India.
It was heartening to see many eminent personalities encouraging our youth in interesting ways for Fit India.
Cine artiste Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Even I have gone through it, you too should view it- it shows him exercising with wooden beads.
He has mentioned that this exercise benefits muscles of the back and the stomach, to a great extent.
Another video of his has gained popularity
in this hes trying his hand on the volleyball with others.
Many other young people have shared their experiences, having joined the Fit India efforts.
I feel movements like these are beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
I would additionally like to mention, that the movement of Fit India, without any expense, is called YOG.
Yog has a special significance in the Fit India campaign. You too must be busy with preparations...
the significance, the merit of 21st June, International Yog Day has been accepted welcomed globally.
Do begin preparing for the Day rightaway.
And not just yourself- your city, village, neighbourhood, school, college, men, women, everyone should make an attempt to connect with yog.
Nowadays, the benefits of yog in ones holistic physical mental development does not need to be told... neither in India nor elsewhere in the world.
You must have viewed an animated video depicting me, that has been widely circulated.
I congratulate those from the field of animation for highlighting nuances, just the way a teacher does.
You too will benefit from it.
I would like to talk to you today, to invite you on a new task.
Ive seen a lot of young people these days, spending time in learning new things.
as it is, an altogether new experience in itself.
One gets an opportunity to experience life anew, away from closeted walls, away from paper pen and computers.
Dear young friends, today I urge you to undergo a special internship.
maybe four- Sports, HRD, Department of Drinking water have come together to launch a Swachch Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
College students, young people from the NCC and Nehru Yuva Kendra, whoever want to do something substantial learn something for the sake of society, the country, those who want to get connected with transforming the country and be a reason for it, those who want to do something or the other for society with a positive energy- for them, there is a great opportunity
Even the cause of the cleanliness campaign will get a boost, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, well surely attain a sense of fulfillment.
And let me tell you, the best out of the best interns who have strived in schools colleges with excellent work will be rewarded with recognition at the national level.
Not just that, those interns who accomplish their tasks well, will be awarded two credit points each, by the UGC.
Once again, I invite students young people, boys girls to avail of the benefits of the internship.
You can register yourselves for the Swachch Bharat Summer Internship on Mygov.
I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward.
I too am eager to know more about your efforts.
Do send in your learning experience, do post your stories, photos and videos.
Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience.
My dear countrymen I try to watch Good News India programme on Doordarshan whenever I get a chance and I would appeal to my countrymen that we all should also watch this Good News India programme wherein we get to know as to how many people in various parts of our country are doing many good things and that such good things are happening.
Recently, I saw that they were presenting the story of some youth from Delhi who are selflessly working in a dedicated manner to help in educating the poor children.
This group of youngsters has started a big campaign in Delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers.
Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission.
Young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation.
Dear brothers and sisters, in this very way, some farmers from hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With their collective efforts, they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, main crops sown are Mandwa, Chaulai, Corn or Barley.
This being a hilly area, the farmers did not get a fair price of their produce.
Besides, there is a strong belief that the land in this area is iron-rich and these iron rich biscuits are very good for pregnant women as they overcome the deficiency of iron.
These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there.
Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district.
With the hard work of these farmers, the annual turnover of the society has gone up from 10 to 15 lakh rupees and with more than 900 families getting employment here, people have stopped migrating to other places.
Do we not feel that water conservation must be a social responsibility
And, we all know this.
And, water conservation is not a new topic for us
it is neither a part of the academic curriculum nor a part of our languages.
Our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together.
They gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water.
They found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water.
May it be Mannarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai you will get to see massive stone inscriptions to this effect.
Several baodis (stepwells) are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished.
Adalaj and Patan Ki Raniki Vaav (Baodi) in Gujarat is a UNESCO World Heritage site and its grandeur is to be seen to be believed.
Baodis are water temples in a way.
If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi.
This is one of the biggest and the most beautiful baodis of India and the point to be noted is that this is situated in a water-scarce area.
April, May, June and July is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance, we can reap a rich harvest.
During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management.
If we talk of 2017-18, 55 percent of the total outlay of Rupees 64 thousand crores, which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores, has been spent on works like water conservation.
In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures.
They succeeded in reviving the dried out Sasur Khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40-45 villages of the area.
This grand achievement is a big boon for animals, birds, farmers, crops and villages.
Aayan Kumar Banerjee from Devi Tola village of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal in his comment on My Gov has written We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people are not aware of the Nobel Laureate Rabindra Naths philosophy of living peacefully, aesthetically and with integrity.
Kindly discuss this point in Mann Ki Baat programme so that more and more people may get to know about this.
Rabindra Nath was a personality full of talent, a multi directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt.
I have a faint memory that probably around 5:30 in the morning, Rabindra Sangeet used to be broadcast on radio and I had developed a habit to listen to Rabindra Sangeet on radio.
You must also have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my respectful homage to Rabindra Nath Tagore.
The month of Ramazan is celebrated with full reverence and respect throughout the world.
The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others.
When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others.
Once a person asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): "Which is the best thing in Islam
" The Prophet Saab said, "feeding a poor and needy and meeting everyone cordially, whether you know him or not
People donate generously to the needy during this holy month.
Prophet Muhammad Sahib believed that a person is rich because of his inherent spirituality, and not materialistic wealth.
We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddhas teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values, which are most desired in the world today.
Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb had said My Social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words liberty, equality and fraternity.
My Philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science.
I have derived them from the teaching of my master, The Buddha.
Baba Saheb strengthened the oppressed, exploited, deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the Constitution of India.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this.
This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people.
We have inherited the wisdom of Lord Buddha throughout Asia as part of our legacy.
I am also very pleased that the Government of India is a partner in the restoration of many Buddhist temples which also includes the centuries old magnificent Anand Temple in Bagan in Myanmar.
Today, when there is confrontation and human suffering prevalent everywhere in the world, Lord Buddha's teachings show the way to rid hatred from the world with compassion.
I wish people spread all over the world who revere Lord Buddha and believe in the principles of compassion- I wish all of them an auspicious Buddha Purnima.
I seek benediction from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
The Indian diaspora was infused with new confidence.
That day also was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Indias western end a nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
It has been 20 years since Pokhranand this test was done on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology.
We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important.
It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels.
On that day, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra - "Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Vigyan.
Witnessing the journey that Atal ji started, we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead.
My dear countrymen, looking forward to our conversation when we will meet for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy day of Ram Navami.
My heartiest greetings to countrymen on this pious, festive occasion.
We have seen how closely the power of Ram Naam, the chant of Lord Rams name, permeated every moment of revered Bapus life.
A while ago, when distinguished dignitaries of all ASEAN Countries were here on the 26th of January, they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Alongwith being IT professional, your love for Sanskrit has gladdened me.
I have instructed the concerned department to convey to you efforts being made in this direction.
I shall also request listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are engaged in the field of Sanskrit, to ponder over ways means to take Komaljis suggestion forward.
You have urged one and all to retain and keep aside some water for birds animals, during summer time.
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your sentiments to our listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
You may now like them, re-tweet them, post them to your friends.
Anagha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written posted to me their heartfelt thoughts on the gratitude cards, the post script to the book Exam Warriors.
Now, if I start including all those phone calls, comments, whatever I could read or hear, many of which touched my heart
if I exclusively speak about them, perhaps Ill require a few months to respond to them in some way or the other.
Theyve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds animals.
Our farmer brothers sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
uite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
During the festival season, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are focused upon.
In utterances of yours, in your experiences, in the examples that you quote, there exists immense inspiration, unfathomable energy, unparalleled warmth
In a way, this is endowed with the might to transform the entire season-cycle of the country.
When I get to read in your letters how a rickshaw puller from Karimgunj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built nine schools for underprivileged children, I witness firsthand the indomitable will-power this country possesses.
When I heard the story of Kanpur based Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary, of how he visits the underprivileged on footpaths and offers free medicines to them, it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country.
Thirteen years ago, on account of a delay in medical treatment, a Cab driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar lost his sister.
This way, after mobilizing funds for twelve long years, Saiduls mammoth efforts paid rich dividends.
Today, through sheer hard work and a firm resolve, a thirty bedded hospital has finally come up at Punri Village near Kolkata.
Innumerable shining examples like these are the hallmark of our country.
Today the whole world has changed the way it looks at India.
YES, we can go forward, the country can take great strides.
This self confidence, this very positivity will by a catalyst in realising our resolve of New India, of making our dream come true.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
That is why a large number of letters on agriculture have been received.
This time, I requisitioned and viewed videos of discussions with our farmers on DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and I feel that each farmer should get connected to this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan, view it and adopt those practices in his her own farm.
How attached was Mahatma Gandhi attached to the soil, they farms and the farmer is reflected from this sentence in which he said- To forget how to dig earth and to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lal ji had talked of creating a mass awakening on an extensive scale about the necessary measures to ensure a better income for our farmers and provide better irrigation facilities and to increase food and milk production.
Chaudhari Charan Singh in his speech in 1979 had urged our farmers to use new technology and to adopt new innovations and underlined their vital significance.
I recently visited the Krishi Unnati Mela organized in New Delhi.
It was a pleasant experience for me to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters and scientists and to listen and understand their experiences in farming and getting to know about innovations in the agricultural sector.
But one thing that impressed me most was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers of the state.
This state has a small area but it has attained a grand success.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
If I may elaborate on this, MSP will include labour cost of other workers employed, expenses incurred on own animals and cost of animals and machinery taken on rent, cost of seeds, cost of each type of fertilizer used, irrigation cost, land revenue paid to the State Government, interest paid on working capital, ground rent in case of leased land and not only this but also the cost of labour of the farmer himself or any other person of his family who contributes his or her labour in agricultural work will also be added to the cost of production.
Moreover, an extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin.
How should the country celebrate it
Swachch Bharat is already our resolve
besides this, how can our 125 crore countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working in close harmony
I request you all to share your opinions and suggestions with everyone via MyGov.
What should be the logo for Gandhi 150
What should be the slogan, mantra or a catch-phrase
In the health sector the nation has now moved ahead from the conventional approach.
Earlier, every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the Health Ministry alone.
But now, all departments and ministries- be it the Sanitation Ministry or Ayush Ministry or Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Consumer Affairs Ministry or the Women Child Welfare Ministry or even the State Governments- they are all working together for Swasth Bharat and stress is being laid on affordable health alongside preventive health.
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness.
All of us took up the responsibility and the result is that in the last four years or so, sanitation coverage has almost doubled and risen to around 80 percent.
Also, extensive work is going on to set up Health Wellness Centres across the country.
It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that Yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.
Less than a hundred days are now left for the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
On the previous three International Yoga Days, people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm.
This time too, we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family, friends and all others from now itself to do yoga.
Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways.
Usually, the countrys Television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on Yoga the whole year.
Can we, beginning now, till the Yoga Day, devise a campaign to spread awareness on Yoga
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together.
This will be a big help to them.
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
Knee implants cost has also been regulated and reduced by 50 to 70.
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana , the Government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide 5 lakh repees for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year.
In the present 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in various states with a view to providing better treatment and health facilities to people across the country.
One new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
According to him the industry was an effective medium by which jobs could be made available to the poorest of the poor and the poorer.
Today, the campaign of Make in India is progressing successfully in consonance with Dr.
In continuance with his vision, smart city mission and urban mission were kick-started in the country so that all kinds of amenities whether good roads, water supply, health facilities, Education or digital connectivity are available in the big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
He did not want anybody to languish in poverty forever.
He also believed that poverty cannot be ameliorated by mere distribution of capital among the impoverished.
Today our monetary policy, Start Up India, Stand Up India initiative have become seedbed for our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
He stressed the utilization of water for the development of the nation The genesis of different river valley authorities, different water related commissions - all these were possible due to the vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today there are landmark efforts, being embarked upon for waterways and ports in our country.
He had talked about the importance of federalism, federal system and stressed on Center and states working together for the upliftment of the country.
He showed us that to succeed it is not necessary for the person to be born in an illustrious or rich family, but even those who are born to poor families in India can also dare to dream their dreams and realize those dreams by achieving success.
And of course, this is exactly what happened as many people mocked Dr.
Under the aegis of this campaign, separate programmes on village development, poverty amelioration and social justice will be held throughout India.
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
My dear countrymen, a spectrum of many festivals would dawn upon us in the next few days- Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and the Baisakhi.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir's birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
I extend felicitations to all on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and in parts of western India in April
My young friends have asked me many questions related to Science
All of us have seen that the sea appears blue, but we know from routine life experiences that water has no colour at all.
Have we ever thought why water acquires colour in rivers and seas
The same thought occurred to a young man in the 1920s.
The same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about Science, the first name that strikes us is that of Bharat Ratna Sir C.
One of his discoveries is famous as the Raman Effect.
We celebrate the 28th of February as National Science Day since on this very day, he is said to have discovered the phenomenon of light scattering, for which the Nobel Prize was conferred upon him.
This land has given birth to many a great scientist.
Right from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently I got an opportunity to take part in a programme in Mumbai the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
Artificial Intelligence aids in making robots, Bots and other machines meant for specific tasks.
Through self learning, machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level.
This technology can be harnessed to better the lives of the underprivileged, the marginalized and the needy.
In that programme on Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to deliberate on how Artificial Intelligence could help us make life easier for our divyang brothers sisters.
Can we make better predictions of natural disasters using Artificial Intelligence
Can we use it to provide assistance to farmers on crop yield
Can Artificial Intelligence be used as tool to simplify the outreach of health services and modernize medical treatment
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of I create.
There a young person referred to developing a digital instrument that converts the written word into voice.
I feel we can harness Artificial Intelligence in many such fields.
Science and Technology are value neutral. They dont possess any value in themselves.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments.
Once, on being asked about it, he quipped, I have devised ten thousand ways of how NOT to make a light bulb.
What I mean to say is, Edison transformed even his failures into his own strength.
Coincidentally, I am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them and questioned subjugation.
The relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the truth is very important.
And this is the very essence, the real inspiration behind scientific inventions and discoveries.
Never rest till every why, what how are answered.
I congratulate our scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, safety in the times of crises, disasters are topics on which many messages keep coming in- people keep writing to me.
In a comment posted on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Shriman Ravindra Singh from Pune has referred to occupational safety.
He writes that in our country, safety standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark.
Since the 4th of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should include safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme in order to raise awareness on safety.
When we refer to public safety, two aspects are very important- proactiveness and preparedness.
Safety is of two kinds one is safety during disasters and the other is safety in everyday life.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters.
We often read signboards on streets bearing lines such as Lose alertness invite mishaps or , One mistake can cost you dear- rob you of your joy smile or , Dont be in a hurry to leave this world embrace the culture of safety or Dont play around with safety, your life will be treated cheap.
I urge the fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them.
This will have a dual benefit the fire brigade will undergo an exercise in readiness and the new generation will get lessons in alertness.
India is a land of geographic and climatic diversities.
As far as disasters are concerned, this country has borne the brunt of many a natural as well as man made disaster, such as chemical industrial mishaps.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, NDMA is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with disasters in the country.
During earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides, NDMA reaches the area within no time.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave.
In 2017, the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
I laud the role played by innumerable individuals, citizens who immediately embark upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes.
And there are numerous such unnamed, unsung heroes.
Our Fire Rescue services, National Disaster Response Forces Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces... these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in distress, often risking their own lives.
Well have to turn ourselves into a risk conscious society.
In our culture, we often talk of safety of values we now need to realize the values of safety.
Well have to make it part of our life, our being.
In day to day life, during air travel, we must have frequently come across air hostesses giving out a rather longish speech, safety instructions at the beginning of a flight. We must have heard it hundreds of times.
But today if one of us is taken inside an aircraft and asked about the location of equipments, say life jackets, and how to use them, I can say for sure that none of us will be able to give the right answer.
And that is why our ears hear when we sit in the aircraft, but no one realizes that these instructions are for me.
We experience this in all walks of life.
Let us not think that safety is only meant for someone else.
If all of us become conscious and aware of our own safety, the essence of safety of society will be inbuilt.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning waste to wealth and waste to energy through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
The aim of this GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into Compost and Bio Gas.
India is home to the highest cattle population in the world, close to 300 million in number, with a daily output of 3 million tonnes of dung.
Under the Swachch Bharat Mission (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction.
Under the aegis of 'GobarDhanYojana', many benefits will accrue to rural areas.
I invite you to become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs, to become a part of the initiative to convert waste in your village to wealth and by converting dung into Gobar dhan.
My dear countrymen, till date, we have been hearing about the myriad types of festivals - be it music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and many other kinds of festivals.
But in a unique endeavor in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first 'Trash Mahotsav' was organized.
The objective behind this festival sponsored by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to generate awareness about cleanliness and the methods using which city's waste can be creatively used and inculcate awareness about various ways to recycle the garbage.
A plethora of activities were organized during this festival, which found full participation of students and adults.
Raipur inspired various types of such garbage or trash festivals in other districts too.
Many individuals taking initiative on their own behalf shared innovative ideas, held discussions, conducted poetry recitals.
For the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and administration.
Every year on March 8, 'International Women's Day' is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
On this day, women are also felicitated with 'Nari Shakti Puraskar' who have performed exemplary tasks in different sectors in the past.
Today the country is moving forward from the path of Women development to women-led development.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Hed said 'The idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence' - This idea of Swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the contemplation of woman power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic life, it is our fundamental duty.
We are part of a tradition where men were identified due to women-Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, these were identities of a son.
Today our woman power has shown inner fortitude and self-confidence, has made herself self-reliant.
Not only has she advanced herself but has carried forward the country and society to newer heights.
After all, our dream of 'New India' is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country.
I liked the idea and Im bouncing it with you will find many examples of what woman power can achieve, If you look around near yourself many such inspiring stories will appear.
I just received news from Jharkhand wherein under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', about 1.
5 million women in Jharkhand and this figure is not a small one organized a hygiene campaign for an entire month
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
It is a very important tourist destination.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted due to electrification.
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of a period of development.
There is no greater contentment and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine and there be happiness in their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
And now the month of March beckons us with ripe crops in the fields, playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month.
But this month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the festival of Holi.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the very first time in history that heads of 10 Nations attended the ceremony.
He writes, The 1st of February is the death anniversary of astronaut Kalpana Chawla.
She left us in the Columbia space shuttle mishap, but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over.
I am thankful to Bhai Prakash ji for beginning his long letter with the sad departure of Kalpana Chawla.
Its a matter of joy that women in India are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields, bringing glory to the Nation.
In our country, respect for women, their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world, since ancient times.
There has been a long tradition of Vidushis...
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, save the girl child, educate her.
But centuries ago, it has been mentioned in our ancient texts, in the Skand Puran :-, R:, This means, a daughter is the equivalent of ten sons.
The Punya that you earn through ten sons amounts to the same earned through just one daughter.
This underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society.
And that is why, in our society, women have been accorded the status of Shakti.
This woman power binds closely together society as a whole, the family as a whole, on the axis of unity oneness.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee be it the learning devotion of Akka Mahadevi or Meerabai, be it the governance of Ahilyabai Holkar or the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, woman power has always inspired us.
They have always brought glory to the Nation.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples.
He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him.
He also refers to INSV Tarini, with an all women crew on board under the command of Vartika Joshi, which is currently circumnavigating the globe.
Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30.
An Air India Boeing jet with an all woman crew led by Kshamata Vajpayee flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back.
These are all women achievers.
Women achievers of our country... the first female Merchant Navy Captain, the first female passenger train driver, the first female fire fighter, the first female Bus Driver, the first woman to set foot on Antarctica, the first woman to reach Mount Everest... First Ladies in every field.
They proved that through perseverance, grit and a firm resolve, all kinds of obstacles and barriers can be broken crossed, to chart out an all new path...
a path that could act as a beacon of inspiration not just to their contemporaries, but for generations to come.
It will infuse a fresh energy, newer enthusiasm into them.
A book has been compiled on these women achievers, first ladies, so that, the entire country comes to know about the power of these women and derive inspiration from their life work.
This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website.
The countrys woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country society these days.
Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station.
You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff.
Empowerment is another form of self reliance.
Dantewada in Chattisgarh is a Maoist infested region.
Violence, torture, explosives, guns, pistols... the Maoists have created a scary reign of terror.
In this dangerous atmosphere, Adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, a number of women have become part of this phenomenon.
And simultaneously as a consequence, it is strengthening efforts towards protecting the environment.
I laud the efforts of the District Administration which has played a significant role in the successful endeavour of these women by ensuring availability of grants imparting training to them.
In our country, there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices, both individually collectively.
Just a while ago, Bihar launched an interesting initiative.
In order to uproot social ills in the state, the worlds longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed.
This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system.
The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils.
Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle.
The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders.
In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills.
Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric... let us build an empowered, capable New India.
Earlier, he wasnt aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now that hes come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75.
Over some time lately, many have written on this subject many of them have been telling me about it.
The motive behind this scheme is making healthcare affordable and encouraging Ease of Living.
Medicines available at the Jan Aushadhi Centres are 50 to 90 cheaper than branded drugs available in the market.
That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices.
Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are now available at Amrit Stores at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres at hospitals.
The sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of uality affordable health service to the poorest of the poor, so that a healthy prosperous India comes into being.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.
The Morna river was a perennial river flowing throughout the twelve months of the year but now it has become seasonal.
The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth.
A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks.
An action plan was chalked out and on January 13th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of 'Mission Clean Morna' sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out.
This noble and grand task named 'Mission Clean Morna', involved more than six thousand denizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, Colleges, Students, children, the elderly, mothers, sisters, almost everybody participated in this task.
On January 20th, 2018, this Sanitation Campaign continued in the same vein and Ive been told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned.
'Mission Clean Morna' shows that if a person is determined to do something, then nothing is impossible.
Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal corporations administration, all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement, I laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards.
These awards also attract attention in newspapers and television also.
There was a certain methodology of awarding Padma Awards every year, but this entire process has been changed for the past three years.
Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country.
Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online.
In a way, the selection of these awards has been transformed completely.
You may have noticed that many ordinary people not visible in big cities, in newspapers or on TV are being awarded with Padma citations.
You must have heard the name of Arvind Gupta ji.
It will gladden your heart to know, that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent all his life creating toys for children.
He has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science.
He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste
towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a dedicated mission
A similar story is that of Sitavaa Jodatti from Karnataka.
She has not been hailed as 'Goddess of women empowerment' just for nothing
For the past three decades, in Belagavi, she has made a great contribution towards changing the lives of countless women.
At the age of seven she had dedicated herself as a Devadasi but in a turnaround, for the welfare of the Devdasis, she has spent her entire life.
Not only this, she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women too.
Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world.
He has exhibited his paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests.
She has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory.
She has mastery in synthesizing medicines used for treatment of snake bites.
Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
Identifying her anonymous persona, she has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her contribution to society.
At the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment, and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard-work.
These people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences.
Beyond awards, there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9th every year.
It was on the 9th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe.
This year we organized a program on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin were invited.
You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin who live in different countries continue to serve those countries and at the same time they have maintained their strong relationship with India as wellThis time, the European Union, has sent me a calendar, in which they have displayed the contributions by Indians in various fields of life living in different countries of Europe
whether working in the field of cyber security, or dedicated to Ayurveda, entertaining the society through music, or through poetry
The 30th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
On that day we also observe 'martyrs day' in solemn memory of the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense of the country and pay our homage at 11 in the morning.
They were not just mere theories.
My dear countrymen, with my best wishes to all of you for 2018, my speech draws to a close.
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and its a coincidence that this day happens to be the last day of the year of 2017.
You and I shared many thoughts and ideas the entire year.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our conversation will go on, just the way it is.
The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of service, Sewa bhaav.
The essence of the spirit of service can be felt in the Bible too.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans used to cite, serve living beings as if worshipping the almighty.
The illustrious life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, full of instances of courage sacrifice is a source of inspiration to all of us.
In this endeavour, he stood to lose a lot on his personal front.
His personality was filled to the brim with the greatest of virtues. Im fortunate that at the beginning of this year, I got an opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebration organized at Patna Sahib.
Come, let us all resolve to imbibe abide by lessons from his great teachings exemplary life and mould our own life in accordance with them.
The 1st of January, 2018, i. e.
tomorrow, in my view, is a special day.
But, when I refer to it as special, I really mean it as special.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century, the New India Voters.
The entire nation is eager to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
As voters of this century, you too must be feeling proud.
Your vote will prove to be the bedrock of New India.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of a democracy.
The vote is the most effective tool in bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
And its not just about you acquiring the right to Vote.
Its about you determining deciding the course of the nation in the 21st century, your dreams in the India of the 21st century.
I consider them New India Youth, New India Youth stands for aspirations, enthusiasm energy.
I firmly believe that the dream of our New India will be realized through the skill fortitude of these energetic youth.
When we talk of new India then that new India will be free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption
free from filth and poverty.
In the New India everyone will have equal opportunity and aspirations and wishes of everyone will be fulfilled.
New India will be a place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force.
My New India Youth should come forward and deliberate on how this New India would be formed.
How could we realize our resolves before 2022
How could we build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is that we build up a mass movement for making a magnificent- glorious 21st century India
a mass movement of development, a mass movement to build a capable and strong India.
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward in areas like skill development, innovation and entrepreneurship and are achieving success.
I wish that the New India Youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from it.
Nothing is impossible for a man having positivity and zeal.
In English too, it is said, Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
All tweets and responses received were really inspiring.
It was indeed a delightful experience.
Some countrymen shared those incidents of this year which left a special impact on their minds, a very positive one at that.
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
SOUND BITE My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I, Delhi.
My daughter wanted to do M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Waade.
I am speaking from Bodal.
One rupee per month was being deducted towards insurance premium which my husband had subscribed to.
He died in an accident.
Only we know of the situation we faced at that time.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
A national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village Bhinnar.
My name is Satish Bewani.
We had a problem of water scarcity in our area and we used to depend on an army pipeline for the last forty years.
Now an Independent pipeline has been constructed.
So, this is our achievement in 2017.
There are a large number of such persons who have brought in positive transformation in the lives of many people through endeavour at their own level.
In fact, this is the New India which we are all collectively building.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on fire in 1990.
Terrorism and violence were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral land and flee from there.
He chose a different path for himself a path of serving the people.
He overcame the adverse situation and scripted his own success story.
Today, he has become a source of inspiration not only in Jammu Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps.
Just last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
there was only enthusiasm, optimism, energy, dreams and a sense of resolve.
Whatever little time I spent with these daughters, I got inspired myself.
These are the strength of our nation, they are my youth, they are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala.
Millions of devotees come to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
It is a huge challenge maintaining cleanliness around such a large religious place where devotees in such huge number come.
And especially, since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests.
Vijayan initiated a programme Punyam Poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness.
And, he began a tradition that the yatra of devotees will remain incomplete if they do not contribute by performing some physical labour or the other in the cleanliness programme.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lords worship.
Every morning, there is a uniquely pleasant scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive.
However big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an official be each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive.
There are many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabrimala and the contribution of Punyan Poonkavanam in this are so immense that each devotee contributes and participates in it.
Here, a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship.
My dear countrymen, all of us made a resolve on Bapus birth anniversary on October 2, 2014 to take forward Bapus unfinished task of building a Clean India and a filth- free India.
Revered Bapu fought for this cause all through his life and made all out efforts.
A change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
Cleanliness Survey 2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas.
This survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
They will talk to the people there and gather their reactions.
They will analyse the use of the Cleanliness App and also about bringing reforms and improvements in various kinds of service centres.
It will also be observed whether the cities have created a system wherein cleanliness of cities will became public habit, or the citys habit for that matter.
It is not for the government alone to maintain cleanliness.
Every citizen and peoples organizations have a big responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to actively participate in the Cleanliness Survey to be undertaken in the coming days.
And take the full onus to ensure that your city should not lag behind and your street or mohalla should not look to be wanting.
Now ranking of cities will be done on the basis of this survey- if your city has a population of more than one lakh, ranking will be done on the national level and if the population of your city is less than one lakh than it will be ranked on regional level.
Let us all, once again remembering revered Bapu and taking a resolve to build a Clean India, put in our best endeavours.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things which appear small but they have a far reaching impact on our image as a society.
Today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
For decades, injustice was being rendered to Muslim women but there was no discussion on it.
Even in many Islamic countries this practice does not exist.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
I have suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that they should ensure that all women who have applied to travel alone be allowed to perform Haj.
Usually there is a lottery system for selection of Haj pilgrims but I would like that single women pilgrims should be excluded from this lottery system and they should be given a chance as a special category.
I not only reiterate this wholeheartedly but it is my firm belief that the journey of Indias progress has been possible due to women-power and on the basis of their talent and we will continue to march onwards on this path of progress.
It should be our constant endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for all of us.
But 26th January, 2018, will especially be remembered through the ages.
The Republic Day will be celebrated with leaders of all ten ASEAN countries coming to India as Chief Guests.
This time, not one but Ten chief guests would grace the Republic Day.
This is unprecedented in India's history.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years of formation in 2017 and in 2017 25 years of India's partnership with ASEAN were completed.
On 26th January the arrival of great leaders of 10 nations of the world as a unit is a matter of pride for all Indians.
My Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, by the way our country is a country of festivals.
There is hardly a day which does not have a festival ascribed to it.
All of us have just celebrated Christmas and the New Year is on its way.
May the New Year bring greater happiness, glad tidings and prosperity for all of you.
Let us move forward with all renewed zeal, enthusiasm, fervor and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial orbit around sun and in this month Makar-Sankranti is also celebrated.
This is a festival linked with nature.
In Rajasthan, it is called Sankrant, Magh-bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu - all these festivals are special in their own right and they have their own importance.
All of these festivals are usually celebrated between 13th and 17thJanuary.
Felicitations to all of you on the occasion of these festivals.
And once again, best wishes for the New Year 2018 to all of you.
I Thank you my dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through.
Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone.
This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately.
I usually refrain from sharing such personal conversations
Modi Ji : Lata Didi, Pranaam.
This is Narendra Modi speaking.
heartiest best wishes on your birthday.
May you stay healthy, may your blessings always be showered upon us, we pray.
And I called you up before leaving to greet you.
Lata Didi: I was touched when I came to know that you would be giving me a call.
When are you returning
Modi Ji : Didi, you see...
Lata Didi: All this is just the fruit of the blessings of my parents the blessings of my listeners.
Lata Didi: You do not have an idea of what you are.
I know for sure that your advent is transforming the landscape of India.
Modi Ji : Yes.
Modi Ji : Your affection made Mother very happy.
And I am extremely thankful to you for the concern that you show towards me.
Once again, I extend my heartiest wishes for your birthday.
This time when I had come to Mumbai, I felt like meeting you in person.
But I shall come very soon to your place.
And I would love you to feed me a Gujarati dish.
Lata Didi: Of course, sure.
I shall feel fortunate privileged.
Modi Ji : Pranaam, Didi.
Lata Didi: Pranaam.
Modi Ji : Lots of good wishes to youLata Didi: Greetings to you.
Modi Ji : Pranaam Didi.
My dear countrymen, with the advent of Navaratri today, the air is bound to be full of new hopes, new energy, newer zest and newer resolves, once again.
The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country.
During festivals, families come together.
And this is what is termed as Chiragh Tale Andhera, darkness just beneath the lamp
Perhaps this adage is not just a set of words for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration.
there are some homes, bathed in shimmering lights on the other hand, just close by, there are some homes mired in darkness.
The true joy radiating out of festivals is only when the darkness subsides and dissipates and a radiant glow emerges.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly.
Can we, this time, during the festival season, dispel some of the darkness beneath the lamp with due awareness and resolve
The smiles thus accrued on the faces of numerous underprivileged families will more than double your joy during festivals... your faces will be lit up with a glow that will brighten your Diwali immensely.
Can we, this time, introduce a novelty in welcoming her
In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity.
There must be numerous daughters amongst us who, through there perseverance, diligence and talent have brought glory to their families, society and the country.
This Diwali, can we arrange programmes to honor the Laxmi of India
If you look around, youll find many daughters and daughters-in-law who are performing extraordinarily.
Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them.
The way we jointly ran a mega campaign Selfi with daughter, which spread globally.
Similarly, this time, let us do a campaign BHARAT KI LAMI.
Encouraging the Laxmi of Bharat amounts to strengthening the paths of prosperity for the country and her citizens.
My dear countrymen, as I have mentioned earlier, a great advantage of Mann Ki Baat is that, Im blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people, known or unknown, directly or indirectly.
A few days ago, AleenaTaayang, a student from far off Arunachal has written an interesting letter to me.
I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
On my exam result this time, some people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors
My experience after that has been very good.
I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I wouldve benefitted a great deal.
At the same time, my little friend has entrusted me with a task, in fact there are orders for me.
But I urge all of you... can you be of help to me
I shall duly go through them, study them.
Ill give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt, I shall try and incorporate that in my own words.
Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal.
S.
open was discussed on the other, runner up Daniil Medvedevs speech was equally doing the rounds in public discourse, especially on social media.
Hence I too heard the speech and watched the match.
The sheer simplicity and maturity displayed by the 23 year old Daniil Medvedev touched everyone.
It surely stirred me.
Moments before this speech, he had suffered defeat at the hands of Tennis legend Rafael Nadal, 19 times grand slam winner.
An event such as this would have pushed anyone towards remorse and despair
Spectators welcomed his reflections with warmth and fervor.
He also touched upon Nadal being the inspiring force in Tennis for millions of young people, adding how difficult it was to face him in the game.
The display of the indomitable ardour of the defeated and the sheer humility of the victorious in the same frame was a sight to behold.
If you havent heard Medvedevs speech yet, I shall urge you, especially young friends to watch this video.
These are moments that go way beyond winning and losing, wherevictory and defeat cease to be.
It is life that is victory...
.
This has been beautifully articulated in our scriptures.
The wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy.
Our ancient texts observe: : Meaning, when ability and humility amalgamate in a person, whose heart will he not be able to win over
As a matter of fact, this young player has won the hearts of people across the globe.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tellyou now is directly for your benefit.
Discourses and debates will continue, the support and opposition will continue, but, if some things are checked before they proliferate, then there is a huge benefit.
Things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages.
But, if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it, then a lot can be saved.
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it.
Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence.
But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic.
You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India.
An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette.
In ane-cigarette, theheating of nicotine-containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed.
Like the conventional cigarette, it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it.
We have seen around us, that, even if the father in any house is a chain smoker, still he tries to stop the rest of the household from smoking and wants his children not to fall prey to the habit of cigarettes or bidis.
His effort is that no family member should take to smoking.
He knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body.
But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different.
There is little awareness among people about e-cigarette.
They are also completely unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e-cigarettessneak into the house out of sheer curiosity.
You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someones pocket, the smell can be detected.
However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigaretteas a fashion statement, keep itbetwixt their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it.
The younger generation is the future of our country.
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country. It does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children.
I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
Do you still remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice
All these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of Fit India.
Our Mother India, our country is a bountiful land
Many gems of human beings took birth here.
India has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, but also the land of their karma.
And these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others.
One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint.
Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becominganoble example for the entire world.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today, while we are celebrating Gandhi 150, our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of Single Use Plastic.
In view of the kind of lead that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the countries of the entire world are looking towards India as a model example.
I am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of Single Use Plastic on 2ndOctober.
In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign.
My attention was drawn towards his work, so, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him.
It could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country.
Mr.
When I first encountered the term Plogging, it was novel even to me.
Perhaps this word is in usage in certain measure in foreign lands.
But, in India, RipudamanBelviji has promoted it to a great extent.
Let's talk to him.
I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps.
Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you.
And to your team, and your imaginative, innovative bent of mind, heartiest congratulations from my side.
I would like to remind you one thing in advance.
some people can begin their practice, whereas some can chalk out a plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, that on 15 August, I had in my address said from the ramparts of Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 tourist destinations in India.
At least 15 places and if possible, make a program to stay over there for an over night, two-night stay.
You should observe, understand and experience India.
My dear countrymen, once again I wish you all the best for various festivals that would be celebrated in the oncoming season in India, which is filled with diversity
Yes
Also, please see to it that during the celebration of Diwali, firecrackers do not lead to incidents of fire or loss of a life.
Whatever precautions or preventive care is to be taken, should be taken during Diwali.
Together brimming with enthusiasm, renewed dreams and resolutions we should celebrate.
Once again heres wishing many felicitations to you all.
Mann Ki Baat November 2017
My dear countrymen, namaskar
A while ago, I had a chance to have an indirect dialogue, with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Group Newspaper Vijaya Karnataka started a new initiative urging the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And, then they published some selected letters.
I read those letters and liked the initiative.
Even these little children are conversant with problems confronting the nation
aware of the deliberations going on in the country.
Kirti Hegde from North Kannada had appreciated Digital India and Smart City schemes and she put forth a suggestion that we need to transform our education system and said that the present-day children do not like classroom reading, they love to know more and more about nature.
And if we impart knowledge about nature to our children then in future they may prove very useful in protecting the environment.
A child Reeda Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of an army man and feels proud of being so.
Which Indian would not be proud of our soldiers
And, you being a soldier daughter should naturally take pride in that.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that her school is 5 Kilometres away from her village and she has to start early in the morning and it gets quite late in the evening by the time she returns home.
She says that as such she does not find time to spend with her friends and has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
But, my countrymen, I liked this initiative taken by a newspaper that helped these letters reach me and I got an opportunity to go through these.
This was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
The 26th of November is our Constitution Day.
The Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on this day in the year nineteen forty-nine.
Our constitution was implemented on the 26th of January, 1950 which we celebrate as our Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
This is the day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They all worked hard for about three years to draft the Constitution.
And, whoever reads that debate will feel proud about what actually the vision of a life dedicated to the nation is.
Can you imagine how hard their task would have been to frame the Constitution of our country which has such big diversities
They must have shown a great sense of understanding and farsightedness and that too at a juncture when the country was getting rid of the bondage of slavery.
There probably is no area, no aspect of nature which remained untouched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the unique characteristic of our Constitution.
It is our duty that we abide by our Constitution in letter and spirit.
Citizens and administrators alike must move ahead in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution.
The message that our Constitution conveys is that no one should be harmed in any way.
Seventeen separate committees were constituted by the Constituent Assembly on various important issues.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this drafting committee.
He was playing a pivotal role in it.
We remember him and bow before him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas on 6th of December.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong can never be forgotten.
15th of December is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel rose from being a farmers son to be known as the Iron Man of the country, undertaking the extraordinary task of uniting India into one nation.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
The country remembers and bows to those brave citizens, policemen, security men and each one who lost their lives then.
This country can never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism has taken an ugly shape and has become a global threat almost as a daily routine.
We, in India, are facing to lot for the last 40 years on account of terrorism.
Thousands of our innocent people have lost their lives.
Terrorism has challenged humanity.
Lord Budha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi this is the land which gave the message of love and non-violence to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social fabric.
That is why, the need of the hour is that humanitarian forces should become more alert and cautious.
My dear countrymen, we shall observe Navy Day on the 4th of December.
All of you must be knowing that our civilization developed along river banks.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with oceans.
And as we peep into our history, we come to know that about 800 to 900 (eight to nine hundred) years ago, during the rule of the Cholas, the Chola Navy was considered one of the strongest navies.
This navy had a big role in the expansion of the Chola-rule and in making it an economic super power.
Numerous references of voyages and expeditions of the Chola-Navy are found even today in Sangam - literature.
Very few people might be aware that most navies of the world allowed women on their warships pretty later.
But in the Chola Navy, a large number of women played leading roles and that too about eight to nine hundred years ago
to the extent that women actively took part in battles.
The Chola rulers possessed a very rich and sound knowledge of ship building.
When we talk of navy, who can ignore Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the capabilities might of his navy.
Konkan coast, where the sea has a significant role, was under Shivaji Maharajs realm.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarn Durg, etc were either situated on the sea coast or were encircled by sea.
The security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha Navy.
There was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
His naval forces were very efficient and skilled in attacking the enemy and in defending their attacks.
And how can we refer to the Maratha Navy and not remember Kanhoji Aangre
He took the Maratha Navy to newer heights and established Maratha Naval Bases at a number of places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pak war.
When we talk of the Navy, we see only war but the Indian Navy has come forward in humanitarian ventures as well.
many fishermen were rescued from the sea and handed over to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our navy reached there immediately and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, during an incident of piracy in a merchant vessel in the Western Gulf, our naval ship INS TRIKAND reached there to help them.
Carrying medical services to FIJI, sending urgent relief, or delivering humanitarian aid during crisis to a neighbouring country our navy has always rendered glorious service.
We Indians, always nurture a feeling of pride and respect towards our security forces- be it the army, the navy or the air force and every countryman salutes the courage, bravery, valour, chivalry and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country so that 125 crore countrymen may live in peace.
We observe ARMED FORCES FLAG DAY every year on 7th December.
This is a day to feel proud of and show respect to our countrys armed forces.
I am happy that the Ministry of Defence has decided to run a campaign from December 1 to December 7 during which they will reach out to the people of the country to disseminate information about our ARMED FORCES and to make them aware.
Throughout the week every one, old or young, should wear the flag.
A movement to instill respect for our forces will come into being in the country.
People from the forces could be invited to schools and colleges to share information about the forces.
Our new generation can get a good opportunity to get information about the forces.
This is also an occasion to collect funds for the welfare of the jawans of our armed forces.
This amount is spent through the Sainik Kalyan Board on the dependents of those who lost their lives and also for those who got injured during wars, for their rehabilitation.
We should also contribute towards their welfare.
I want to tell something to my farmer brothers and sisters.
An important component of the Earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is linked only to this soil.
In a way, the complete food chain is connected to soil.
Just imagine, what will happen if there is no fertile soil in the world
The very thought is dreadful.
This concern was touched upon a long time ago in our culture and that is why we are aware of the significance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, there has been efforts to foster a feeling of devotion and gratitude towards our farms, our soil among the people and at the same time scientific farming methods and techniques have been adopted which provide nutrients to the soil.
In the life of the farmer of this country both aspects have been important- reverence to his soil and preserving nurturing it scientifically.
We all feel proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are rooted to traditions and also take interest in modern science, they keep trying and resolve.
I had heard about the farmers, of Tohoo village in Bhoranj block of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh.
Produce reduced which resulted in lower income and gradually the productivity of the soil also was going down.
Some enlightened and alert farmers in the village noticed and understood the gravity of the situation, and after that got their soil tested on time and followed the advice about the quantity of fertilizers, micro-nutrients and organic fertilizers to be used.
And, you will be surprised to know about the results achieved after the farmers received the information and guidelines about soil health.
Besides, the soil quality also improved.
And, now the farmer also realizes that proper soil care is needed if production is to be increased and that if we take care of our soil, it will also care for all of us.
Our farmers across the country have got more than 10 crore soil health cards made so that they may understand their soil better and accordingly sow the crop.
We worship mother Earth but have we ever thought as to how much damage is caused to the health of our mother- Earth because of the usage of fertilizers like Urea
This has been proved by all scientific methods that a serious damage is caused because of an excessive use of urea.
Can our farmers, the sons of our soil make a resolve that by the year 2022, when we complete 75 year of our independence, they will cut down the urea usage to half of what is being used presently
All of us are experiencing Global warming, climate change now.
There was a time when winter would set in even before Diwali.
And now, December is knocking on our doors, yet winter is advancing at a leisurely pace.
The eight year old is speech impaired, but he used a whistle as an armament.
He would wake up at 5 in the morning, visit households one by one, awaken them and used gesticulations to wean them away from Open defecation.
Covering 30 to 40 homes everyday, spreading the message of cleanliness, this boy transformed the village into Open defecation free.
Promoting the virtues of cleanliness, this little lad has done inspiring work.
they are competent, capable, courageous and determined.
We get to learn something or the other every moment.
They are performing well in every walk of life.
Whether it be the field of sports, any kind of competition or a social initiative, our Divyang brethren are second to none.
You must be aware that our Divyang sportspersons won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics through their stellar performances.
Myriad competitions take place all over the country.
Recently, the 17th National Para-Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Divyang brothers sisters from different parts of the country participated displayed their stellar skills.
One of them happens to be 19 year old Jigar Thakkar from Gujarat, whose body suffers from 80 muscle atrophy.
It is on account of this feat that he has been chosen as one of the 32 Para Swimmers for the 20-20 Paralympics by the Sports Authority of India.
They will be imparted training at the Centre for excellence at Gandhinagar in Gujarat.
I salute the spirit of the young Jigar Thakkar wish him the best.
These days special emphasis is being laid on accessibilities opportunities for persons with disabilities, our Divyang brethren.
Our endeavour is to ensure that each every person in the country is empowered.
A few days from now, the pious occasion of Id-e-milad-un-nabi will be observed.
Paighambar Hazrat Mohammad Sahab was born on this day.
I extend best wishes to all countrymen.
But continuing from your point of view I feel like adding something more to it and modifying it a bit.
And as in our villages, our elders, the old people of the village are always reminding us - forget the sorrow but also do not forget the joy.
You too forget your sorrow and also do not forget the joy.
Can we not contribute in this endeavour
Come, let us share our positive experiences with PositiveIndia (Hashtag Positive India) on the Narendra Modi App or MyGov portal.
Remember to recollect the incidents that inspire others.
If you remember positive events, then you will be in a mood to do good around you.
Positive events provide energy to do good.
Let all of us together witness the strength of this collective momentum and its impact.
We will have another opportunity to talk a lot.
Mann Ki Baat October 2017
Surya Jal The Sun Water are central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made of bamboo clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja articles.
In this mega festival of faith, veneration of the rising sun and worship of the setting sun convey a message that is replete with unparalleled Sanskar.
The world respects venerates those who rise
the Chatth Pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to respect revere those whose setting, whose dusk is imminent.
The expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival.
Before the advent of Chatth, people come together to clean up their homes, and along with that cleansing of rivers, lakes, pond banks and pooja locations, that is ghats, with utmost enthusiasm fervour.
Sun worship or Chhath Pooja is a festival of protecting the environment, ushering in wellness and discipline.
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi Handloom store.
During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise.
Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi Handicrafts have risen almost by 90.
One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi handloom.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our countrys soldiers.
Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel.
Memories of Diwali celebrations with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu Kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart.
On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the countrys borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds.
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations.
United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of October.
Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world.
And, we are believers in Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam which means the whole world is our family.
And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN.
India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this.
In its initial phrase, it was proposed as all men are born free and equal which was amended and adopted as all human beings are born free and equal with the efforts of the Indian representative Hansa Mehta.
It appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought.
Indias most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always been extending active support to UN Peace Missions.
Many of you may be getting to know this for the first time.
More than 18 thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over.
These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world.
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved.
Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Very few people may know that India was the first country which sent a female police unit to Liberia for the United Nations Peace Mission.
And see how this initiative from India became a big source of motivation for other countries too.
Later, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will surely feel proud to know that Indias contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas.
They have to live amongst many different people.
They need to know and adapt to various situations and different cultures.
They have to mould themselves according to the local needs and environment.
While remembering our brave UN Peacekeepers today, who can forget the sacrifice of Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria who laid down his life while fighting in Congo in Africa
Every Indian feels proud while remembering him.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Force Commander for an operation in Namibia and he gave his services to ensure the Independence of that country.
General Thimaiyya, who had been Indias army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person.
She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA.
And Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated.
She later proved herself true to her name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped publication of Basus research and publicity through her articles and conferences.
This is Indias unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to this.
In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time.
Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health, started cleaning drains and roads.
She was a woman who could live a luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor.
Getting inspiration from her sacrifice, people came forward and joined her.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of Children's Day celebrated on the birthday of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India.
Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life - have started to appear in children nowadays.
It is indeed surprising today, when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits.
Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
If youll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life.
The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children.
Yoga for Young India.
I am saying this because a person of any age can easily practise it.
It is simple because it can be easily learned and it is accessible, since it can be done anywhere.
No special tools or fields are needed.
There are several studies being conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes.
Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of medical treatment only instead of this we should make them a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports.
In different games, our athletes have made the country proud.
In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its dazzling performance.
Our players performed magnificently and on the basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion after an interval of ten years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007.
I extend felicitations on behalf of the entire nation to the entire team and support staff.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indians heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title.
I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India.
Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field.
I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and the spectators.
The world cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Regardless of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The whole world including India enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both full of interest and entertainment for football lovers.
The signs that the future of football is very bright have started to appear.
I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again.
Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts.
An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign lasting for two hundred days, people performed the task of cleaning the fort, non-stop, without any fatigue and with team-work.
I was overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs, no matter how upset he is on witnessing the filth around him, and wondering how the mission of cleanliness will be fulfilled - then I have to tell such people that you can see for yourself the toil, resolve and determination of the members of the Ecological Protection Organization, in these living pictures.
Just on seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope.
This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum.
My dear countrymen, well celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Partaking of LANGAR together created a feeling of unity oneness in people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji voiced three messages for a meaningful, fulfilling life- Chant the name of the Almighty, work hard and help the needy.
In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani.
Come 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Come, let us try advance on the path of his ideals teachings.
My dear countrymen, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, two days from now, on the 31st of October.
All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation stone of modern, unified India.
We can learn a lot from the unparalleled saga of this great son of Mother India.
Translating a thought into reality was his forte.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation one constitution.
His decision making ability infused in him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit determination.
It was only he who could achieve this task of uniting India.
He conceived a nation where everyone was equal.
One ideal of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will always be inspiring to all of us.
These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge you to participate in Run for Unity, the festival of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, you mustve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination.
May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you.
It is now a full three years since I started speaking to you over Mann Ki Baat.
This is the 36th episode today.
And when I say things in Mann Ki Baat, people from across the country send their ideas, experiences and feelings to me.
Most of these are inspiring to me.
A large number of these ideas are regarding improvements in the functioning of our government.
There are personal grievances and complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to community problems.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one sentence of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
I surely believe and feel that now after three years, social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect, positive as well as negative.
And I am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it.
And, in one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had said that while having our food, we must also be conscious of consuming only as much as we need and see to it that there is no wastage.
But, later, I received letters from all corners of the country. Many social organizations and many youth are already observing this in practice.
And then I saw that a lot many people came forward to donate for this cause.
In no time, Selfie with Daughter became a big campaign not only in India but across the whole world.
This is not only an issue of social media.
It became an incident to create a new self-confidence and a feeling of self pride in every daughter.
Every parent started feeling that they should take a selfie with their daughter.
Every daughter started regaining her own self confidence self esteem.
I was in a meeting with the Tourism Department recently.
I asked people who were planning to go travelling that where-ever they visit Incredible India, they must send photographs of those places.
Lakhs of photographs from every corner of India were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
Ive experienced through Mann Ki Baat that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign.
Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events incidents over those three years ran across my mind.
The nation is always ready to move in the right direction.
This is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country.
I heartily bow to my countrymen.
In one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had discussed about Khadi and Khadi is not a fabric but an idea, a principle.
May be a bed-sheet in the house, a handkerchief or a curtain, it has been felt that the younger generation has got interested in Khadi.
Sale of Khadi has increased and as a result of this, the poor mans household has directly got connected to employment.
Discount is offered on Khadi from 2nd October and people get quite a good rebate.
The poor of our country will derive strength from this and we must do it.
The increasing interest in Khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the Khadi sector as well as those connected, in any way, with Khadi.
How do we bring in new technology, how do we increase productivity, how do we introduce looms driven by solar power
How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years
A number of thoughts were implemented.
New employment opportunities were created for a number of people.
Khadi Gramodyog revived its training centre at Pampore in Kashmir and in this sector Kashmir has so much to offer.
With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts.
Even people have started exchanging Khadi items as gifts.
We now experience how something grows naturally.
My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last months Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti.
We shall connect people through cleanliness.
Our Honourable President inaugurated this programme and the country got connected.
The old or the young, men or women, city or village everyone has become a part of this Cleanliness campaign now.
I am grateful to our Honourable President.
But, every section of society has taken this as its own campaign, everyone has got connected to this.
Whether it be people from the sports world, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, government employees, police, or army jawans every one has got connected with this.
A kind of a pressure has been created in public places and now people resist if someone tries to spoil or to make a public place dirty in any way and even those spoiling public places are also feeling this pressure.
It is a good thing and I am pleased to know that just in the first four days of Swachhata Hi Sewa Abhiyan more than 75 lakh people joined these activities with more than 40 thousand initiatives.
I noticed something else this time one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth
but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also.
This time a number of competitions were organized on the theme Cleanliness is Service.
More than two and a half crore children took part in an Essay Competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children made paintings.
Whenever there is a reference to cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons.
They have taken this campaign in a religious manner.
They have made a big contribution in creating a positive environment and are leading the Cleanliness Campaign in their own ways.
Just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards Bilal Dar, a young man of 18 years from Srinagar.
And you will be glad to know that Srinagar Municipal Corporation has made him their brand ambassador and when there is a talk of brand ambassador, there is a general feeling that heshe must be a Cine artist or a sports-personality.
He clears plastic, polythene, used bottles, dry or wet waste every piece of dirt from Aisas biggest lake near Srinagar.
And I am glad that they have not only appointed Bilal as their ambassador but also given him a vehicle, and also a uniform and he goes to other areas and educates people about cleanliness and inspires them and keeps tracking them till results are achieved.
Bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history, it is but natural to recall our great men.
The month of October is a month to remember so many of our titans.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, there are many great leaders who gave us the direction towards the 20th and 21st century, led us, guided us and faced so many hardships for the country.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
And, what was the main focus of all these great men
One thing was common and that was to live for the country, do something for the nation
Gandhiji, Jai Prakashji, Deen Dayalji were such great personalities who remained far away from the corridors of power but lived every moment for the people, kept fighting all odds following the principle Sarv Jan Hitay Sarv Jan Sukhay, they kept endeavouring tirelessly.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyayji also talked about the last person at the farthest fringes.
Sardar Saheb unified the country.
We also have to run for unity in order to promote the mantra of unity.
We should feel Indias diversity, touch it, feel its fragrance.
You may see for yourself, that for your inner development also, these diversities of our country work as a big teaching tool.
There are vacations, Diwali is drawing near, all around in our country, there is an inclination to travel to some place or the other
people go as tourists and it is very natural.
But, it is a matter of concern when we do not see our own country, we do not know about its diversities nor do we understand them.
People of West India may not be knowing what all is there in the East
Our country is full of such myriad diversities.
If you refer to Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand, our former President Abdul Kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around India, they got to see and understand India and they got inspired to do and die for the country.
All these great men travelled widely in India.
At the beginning of their endeavour, they tried to know and understand India
tried to live India within themselves.
Can we make an effort as a student to learn, understand and try to live as per the traditions, culture, attire, eating habits and beliefs of different states, different societies, different groups of our country
There will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate, understand adapt.
This is my personal experience, I had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of India.
In more than four hundred fifty districts, I had a night stay too.
And now, when I am shouldering this responsibility in India, that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful.
That helps me a lot in understanding things.
I request you too, to feel the Unity in Diversity which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy.
The dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in this.
How many varieties of cuisines there are
If we eat a new dish every day, we wont have to repeat any variety throughout our life.
This is the power of our tourism.
I would request that during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know, understand gain something.
Internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of India within you.
These experiences will enrich your lives.
Your vision will expand.
And, who can be a better teacher than experience
Generally, October to March is the suitable time for tourism.
People travel.
I am sure that even this time if you go, you will lend further fillip to my campaign.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photographs.
You must send photographs on incredibleindia.
If you happen to meet people there, send their photos too.
Write not only about architecture or natural beauty but write something about their daily life too.
Write good travelogues.
Send on Mygov. And on Narendra Modi App.
A thought comes to my mind, that in order to promote tourism in India what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state every Indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state.
If possible, one must visit these seven places.
Can you provide some information about that
The government will accept suggestions about making films, videos or preparing publicity material and about promoting that destination.
You can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this October to March.
I invite you.
They leave a deep impression on my heart.
After all I am also a human being just like you.
You might have noticed one recent incident, a unique example of grit, determination and patriotism that was witnessed by all countrymen.
Their husbands laid down their lives in the service of mother India.
One can imagine ones agonizing mental state if her world gets shattered at such a early age
But Swati Mahadik, the wife of martyr colonel Santosh Mahadik resolved to face the difficult situations and she joined the Indian Army.
She received training for 11 months putting in great efforts and she put her life at stake to fulfill her husbands dreams.
His wife Nidhi also took a resolve and joined the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to have a deep sense of respect for these two bravehearts, our Matri Shakti.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to both of them.
They have evoked a new inspiration and a new awakening among millions of our countrymen.
Many congratulation to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali.
FIFA under- 17 world cup is being organized in our country.
I am sure reverberations of the spirit of football will be heard all around.
It will evince more interest in Football in every generation.
My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on.
It is a time for praying to Ma Durga.
The whole environment is filled with sacred fragrance.
All around there is an atmosphere of spirituality, an air of festivities, an atmosphere of bhakti, of reverence.
This is revered as a festival of Shakti Sadhana.
May the nation move forward and may the year two thousand twenty two- 75 years of Indias Independence be an attempt to realize the dreams of our freedom fighters, the resolve of 125 crore countrymen, with their tremendous hard work, courage and determination to fulfill our resolve and prepare a roadmap for five years. We have moved on
Many Many thanks.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar.
When on the one hand, a sense of festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes in, from one part of the country, it is only natural of be concerned.
Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect these are inherent to us.
We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa ParmoDharmah from our childhood.
In my address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar there is every provision for ensuring justice for each and every person.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression whether it is a person or a group neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Each and every person will have to abide by the law
the law will fix accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished.
My dear countrymen,our country is a land of diversities these diversities are not limited to our cuisine, life style and attire.
We observe diversity in every walk of life.
Even our festivals are replete with diversity.
Ours is arich cultural heritage, spanning thousands of years when we look at our cultural traditions, social customs, historical events, there would hardly be a day left in the year which is not connected with a festival.
You would have noticed, that all our festivals follow the almanac of nature.
There is a direct connect with nature.
Many of our festivals are linked straightaway with farmers and fishermen.
Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam.
The Jain community celebrated the SamvatsariParva yesterday.
In the month of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community.
The last day of ParyushanParva is observed as Samvatsari.
This is indeed a remarkable tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood.
It is also known as the KshamavaniParva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other with, michhamidukkadam.
We have been hearing in our shaastras, our holy texts, KshamaVeerasya Bhushanam, that is, forgiveness is the adornment of the brave.
The one who forgives is valiant.
And Mahatma Gandhi always said, that forgiveness is the quality of great men.
Shakespeare in his play, The Merchant of Venice, while explaining the importance of forgiveness, has written, Mercy is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes, meaning, the forgiver and the forgiven both stand to receive divine blessing.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival.
This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty.
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
This festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
It gives the message of love and harmony - awakens new hopes and aspirations, and gives new confidence to the people.
Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism.
And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions.
Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors.
We should think about what more can be done in this direction.
In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-uha will be celebrated in a few days from now.
Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well.
My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing.
All sorts of experiments are being carried out in every family.
What a massive transformation this has been a pleasant one at that.
And as I mentioned, our country is blessed with millions and millions of the brightest of brains.
And it is nice to see all sorts of new innovations.
Someone told me about a gentleman who is an engineer and who has collected and combined special varieties of clay, to give training in making Ganesh idols.
The Ganesh Visarjan or immersion is done in a small bucket of water, where the idol dissolves within no time.
And he didnt stop there.
The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October.
And the positive results are now being seen.
Toilets have increased from 39 to almost 67 of the population
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free. Gujarat saw devastating floods recently.
Many people lost their lives.
When the waters receded, there was so much filth everywhere.
Lets create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
in where after constructing a toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary family, who you helped.
You can write essays in various languages and there is no age limit.
You can make a short film even with your mobile phone.
You can film a two-three-minute movie that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language it could be silent too.
Make your effort to be a part of it.
You will see how the Gandhi Jayanti of this 2nd October shines.
You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign, Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October.
My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you.
Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness.
I always look forward with anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share.
It is an opportunity to test my endeavors on this touchstone.
Even the smallest of your suggestions help me in thinking anew on a wide variety of subjects.
Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune.
I went for shopping with her at a mall.
She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza.
Whereas, she haggled for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who took us to the mall.
On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees.
I feel very bad.
We spend extravagantly in high places, without a single thought, but when it comes to our hardworking brethren, we quarrel with them over small amounts.
We dont trust them.
Please speak about this on Mann kiBaat.
Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.
My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey was unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well.
Sports means, physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement.
What else does one need
Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together.
Young friends, the Sports Ministry is launching a Sports Talent Search Portal to search for sporting talent and to groom them.
Any talented child who has an achievement in sports, can upload his biodata or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected emerging players. The Ministry is launching the portal tomorrow.
The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be making India their home.
Their grit and zeal, is inspiring for all of us.
These six young women will embark on a voyage across the seas, in a small boat, INS Tarini.
The expedition has been named, NavikaSagar Parikrama.
They will circumnavigate the globe and return home, after many months.
Our six daughters riding the waves of the high seas, with courage, is the first instance of its kind in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teachers Day.
He was the President, but all through his life, he saw himself as a teacher.
He preferred to live a teachers life.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, the President of India and yet, quintessentially a teacher.
I salute him.
The great scientist Albert Einstein said, It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge. The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning.
As we celebrate Teachers Day this year can we come together and take a resolve
Can we run a campaign in mission mode
Teach to Transform, Educate to Empower, Learn to Lead. Can we move ahead with this resolve
Get someone committed to a five-year resolve.
Show him the path of attainment, which he can achieve in five years - so that he can experience the joy of success in life.
Such an atmosphere can be created by our schools, our colleges, our teachers, our educational institutions.
When we speak about transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers.
The teacher plays a vital role in transformation.
In the life of every teacher, there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebodys life.
We will play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a collective effort.
Come, lets move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform.
Pranam Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Dr.
Ananya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I have been specially interested in Financial Inclusion.
With reference to the social schemes related to Financial Inclusion, my question to you is: In the backdrop of the Jan DhanYojna launched in 2014, can you say that, do the statistics show thattoday, three years later, India is financially more secure and stronger, and whether this empowerment and benefits have percolated down to our women, farmers and workers, in villages and small towns.
On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts.
Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened.
This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren.
Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti BimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojna, with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor.
For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupeeinsurance,they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days.
in, so that people can read them and be inspired by how a scheme can bring about transformation in the life of a person, how it can bring a new energy, a new confidence hundreds of examples have come before me.
They too, can interview such people, and inspire the young generation.
My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you michchamidukkadm.
Thank you very much.
We human beings have a natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season.
Climate change, altered weather cycles, and transformations in the environment, are also having a big negative impact.
Recently, in certain parts of India, particularly, Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some areas of Bengal, have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters, caused by excessive rains.
The state governments too are making maximum possible efforts on their part to provide relief to the flood affected people.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and common citizens charged with the spirit of service are also making their utmost efforts to help the affected people in this situation.
The Government of India, Army personnel, Air Force personnel, NDRF personnel, Paramilitary forces everybody does his or her best in providing succour to the disaster stricken people.
Life goes completely topsy-turvy as a result of the floods.
NDRF teams were deployed.
volunteers were enlisted, and a peoples organisation set up to work in this situation. Weather forecasts are available these days and the concerned technology has become so advanced these days, and space science also plays a very big role, that these weather forecasts turn out to be mostly accurate now.
We should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions, which could safeguard us against losses.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day and was deeply impressed.
In the same manner, Goods and Services Tax, GST, was launched on this very day last month.
When a person from the North-East, someone living in the remote areas, in the hills or forests, writes a letter to communicate that in the beginning, he used to be apprehensive about GST wondering what it was all about, but now that he has begun to understand it, he feels that things have become much easier than before.
The time required to cover distances has come down drastically. Highways have become clutter-free.
Pollution levels have come down with the increased speeds of the trucks.
Goods are also being transported much faster.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.
And some day, the Pundits of Economics, Pundits of Management and Pundits of Technology, will certainly undertake researches and write about Indias GST experiment as a model for the world.
It will become a case study for universities across the world.
The implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale, with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country, is in itself a pinnacle of success.
The world will definitely make a study of it.
And this implementation has had all the states participating in it and sharing the responsibility.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the Centre together.
The lofty dream of One Nation One Tax has finally been fulfilled.
The manner in which the friendly environment was created between the Government and traders, between the government and consumers, played a very significant role in enhancing mutual trust.
I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process.
GST is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of India.
This is a historic achievement.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reformation.
I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution.
and on 15thAugust 1947 India became independent.
In a way, there are many events in the month of August that are closely associated with the history of our freedom movement.
This year, we are going to observe the 75th Anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of India, with their ardent desire for freedom, came together, fought together, and suffered hardships
these pages of history are an inspiration to us for building a glorious India.
It was this movement that had made the entire nation determined to attain freedom from the British Rule.
Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhis clarion call and the mantra of Do or Die
Millions of the youth of the country renounced their studies, gave up their books.
They set out on the march to the sound of the bugle for freedom.
Mahatma Gandhi gave a call for the uit India Movement on 9th August, but each and every prominent leader had been imprisoned by the British Government, and it was during this time that the second generation of leadership comprising great men like Dr.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narain played a leading and pivotal role.
The reason for this entire success was the peoples support, peoples resolve, and peoples struggle.
This perseverance, this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942
the clarion call of uit India was such that within five years, in 1947 the British were compelled to leave India.
I would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation.
We became free in 1947.
This is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
Governments have come and gone.
There have been successes.
Expectations have also risen.
The way, the years from 1942 to 1947 were the decisive years for attainment through resolve.
I can see that 2017 to 2022 presents itself as a new time segment of five years for attainment through resolve.
let there be millions and millions of resolves
let there be strivings for the realisation of these millions and millions of resolves.
Therefore, we must take a firm resolve today.
We must make 2017 our Year of Resolve.
In this month of August, we have to come together and resolve: Filth uit India
The need for today is not Do or Die, instead it is to resolve, to come together, persevere, and work relentlessly with our utmost strength towards the making of a new India.
A resolve that we will positively fulfil in the next five years.
Youth organisations, student organisations, NGOs, etc.
can organise group discussions, to bring forth new ideas.
Where do we want to reach as a nation
What can be my contribution for this as an individual
They can use technology videos, posts, blogs, scripts, novel ideas to put forward all these.
Transform this campaign into a peoples movement.
A uit India uiz is also being launched for my young friends on NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with Indias glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement.
It is my belief that you will surely publicise and spread awareness about this quiz.
This time too, I invite you to share your thoughts either on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I read these myself and shall try to express them in whatever time I have with me on 15th August.
I have planned to keep my speech short this time not more than 40-45-50 minutes.
My countrymen, I would like to say one more thing to you.
Indias economy has in itself an element of social economics.
And we should never underestimate its value.
Our festivals, our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment.
Our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too.
They connect the individual with society.
Rakhi makers and their sellers, sweets shops vendors the professions of hundreds, thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival.
The households of our poor brethren and their families are dependent in a way on these activities.
When we light a diya, an earthen lamp on Deepawali, it is not merely a festival of lights, a festival that illuminates the entire house
it is directly connected with those poor families who make small diyas or earthen lamps.
Today as I speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor, I want to touch upon the subject of environment as well.
I have observed and sometimes think that the citizens of our country are more aware and active than me.
For the last one month, environmentally conscious citizens have constantly written letters to me.
And they have requested that I talk about eco-friendly Ganesha idols, well in time for people to plan for clay Ganesha idols during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Firstly, I am most grateful to such conscientious citizens.
And this time I have spoken about it well in time.
I am sure that all of you will join me.
This will surely benefit our poor artisans, and artists, and provide employment to those who make idols.
The poor will be able to earn a living and feed themselves.
Come, let us link our festivities with the economic welfare of the poor, let the joys of our festivals connect with the households of the underprivileged, bringing monetary happiness to the have-nots.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations.
My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports they are scaling new heights.
We as a nation take great pride in our daughters.
Recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
This stress, this tension was evident on their faces also.
So while speaking to these daughters, I put forth a different viewpoint before them.
I said, Look, this is the age of the media.
You may not have won the final match but you have won the hearts of 1.
Truly our young generation, especially the daughters of our country are doing so much to bring glory to the nation.
I once again extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the young generation of our country, especially our daughters.
My dear countrymen, I remind you once again of Agast Kranti, of 9th August, I remind you once again of 15th August.
And I am reminding you once again of 2022, 75 years of Indias Independence.
Every countryman should make a resolve, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to realise that resolve.
All of us have to take our nation to newer heights.
Come, lets march together as we do our bit.
The destiny, the future of the country shall be brighter, let us move ahead with this belief.
The weather is changing.
The weather has become pleasant in several parts of the country with abundant showers.
As a result of the rains, the cool breeze has brought about some respite from the oppressive heat of past few days.
One has seen that no matter how hectic the life is, no matter how tense we are, whether its ones personal or public life, the arrival of the rains does lift ones spirits.
The Car festival of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra, is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour.
This festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, would have observed that he had wholeheartedly praised the Lord Jagannath temple and its traditions, since, social justice and social equality were inherent to these.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
But few would know that in English, there is a word, juggernaut which means, a magnificent chariot, that is unstoppable.
In the dictionary, the etymology of the word juggernaut traces its roots to the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
And therefore, we can observe that the world has in its own way accepted the significance of the Car Festival of Lord Jagannath, The Rath Yatra.
The holy month of Ramzan is observed all across, in prayer with piety.
And now the festival of Eid is here.
On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my heartiest greetings to one and all.
Ramzan is a month of charity, and sharing joy.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came across a very inspiring incident at Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brethren reside in that little village and in a way, form a majority of its population.
During this Ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets.
and that this sum of 17 lakh rupees be used for providing other facilities in the village.
I felicitate the residents of Mubarakpur, for transforming the pious occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society on.
Each and everything about them is inspiring.
And the most important of it all is that they have freed Mubarakpur of the scourge of open defecation.
We know that in our country there are three states that have already been declared Open Defecation Free states, that is, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF, this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, government and especially the people of these five states, for achieving this objective.
Only then will the habit of the body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is also similar to this.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
Recently I came across a wonderful incident, which I would like to share with you.
This happened in the Vizianagaram District of Andhra Pradesh.
And what was the objective
To construct 10,000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in those hundred hours.
And my Dear Countrymen, you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10,000 toilets in hundred hours successfully.
71 villages became ODF.
in, through letters and Akashvani.
Shri Prakash Tripathi reminiscing about the Emergency, has written, presenting 25thof June as a Dark period in the history of Democracy.
Prakash Tripathi jis commitment to democracy is praiseworthy.
Not only is Democracy a system, but also a sanskar- a part of our ethos.
Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty.
One needs to be constantly alert about our Democracy, that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy
and at the same time move ahead, carrying forward the virtues of democracy.
1975 25th June it was a dark night that no devotee of democracy can ever forget.
The country had virtually become a prison.
The voice of the opposition had been smothered.
Several prominent leaders including Jai Prakash Narayan had been jailed.
The judicial system too could not escape the sinister shadows of the Emergency.
The press was completely muffled.
The present-day students of journalism and the champions of democracy have been endeavouring towards raising awareness about that dark period, by constant reminders, and should continue to do so.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail at that time.
After one year of Emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, in which he describes the state of mind during those turbulent times.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today, is proud and holds his head high.
21st June 2017 Yoga has permeated the entire world.
From the seashores to the mountains, people welcomed the first rays of the sun, with Yoga.
Which Indian wouldnt be proud of this
It isnt as if Yoga didnt exist before, but now the threads of Yoga have bound everyone together, and have become the means to unite the world.
Almost all the countries in the world made Yoga Day their own.
In China, Yoga was practiced on the Great Wall of China, and on the World Heritage site of Machu Picchu in Peru, at 2400 metres above sea level.
In France, yoga was performed in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower.
In a small country like Singapore, programs were organised in 70 places, with a week long campaign.
On the occasion of International Day of Yoga, the UN released ten stamps.
A Yoga Session with Yoga Masters was organised at the UN headquarters.
The staff of the UN and diplomats from across the world participated.
Yoga has created a world record again this time also.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, around 55 thousand people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I too had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event held in Lucknow.
Whether it is our armed forces, or the BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF, each one of them, apart from their duties has made Yoga a part of their lives.
Some TV channels also took this idea forward.
Recently in Kerala, we heard you speak about replacing bouquets that we give as gifts, with good books as mementos.
You had started this practice while you were in office in Gujarat, Sir, but in the recent days we have not been seeing much of this.
So, can we do something about it
Is there nothing we can do to have this implemented throughout the country, Sir
And that too, a Khadi handkerchief, so that it promotes Khadi.
Till the time I was in Gujarat, this habit had been ingrained in us, but after coming here, I had lost that habit.
When I went to Kerala, it was rekindled.
I have already begun to issue instructions in the government.
Here too we can gradually nurture this habit.
And the life span of a bouquet is very short.
You receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it.
One can also use a Khadi handkerchief to welcome people, and be a support to the innumerable underprivileged.
The expenses are reduced as well, and the gift is well utilized too.
So many years have passed and yet, ueen Elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by Mahatma Gandhi.
I get a variety of letters, written by all sorts of people.
Recently, I had the opportunity to read a letter, which I feel, I should share with you.
From the far south, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a housewife, sent me a letter.
And what was in that letter
She wrote, that she thought about engaging in some economic activity keeping in mind her responsibilities such as childrens education, to lend some financial assistance to her family.
She got some money from the bank, under the Mudra Scheme and commenced working towards procuring some items from the market for sale.
So, when people register in E-GEM, all the government departments become aware of them.
And the best part is, what she has written in this letter is very interesting.
She has written that she got the money from the Mudra Scheme and started her business, then she registered the inventory of all her products on the E-GEM website, and then she got an order from the Prime Ministers Office.
It was news to me also, I wondered what the PMO would have ordered.
She wrote that the PMO had ordered two thermoses, and she was paid Rupees 1600-.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity for encouraging entrepreneurship.
This has transparency, this has empowerment, this has entrepreneurship too.
Government E-Marketplace - GEM.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we take pride in Yoga, on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
Today, Indias flag is flying high not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites with the Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And besides India, these satellites are of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, nearly 14 such countries.
And with Indias Nano Satellite Mission, we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture, farming, and dealing with natural disasters.
We are all aware that a few days ago, ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And of all the satellites launched by India, this was the heaviest satellite.
The newspapers of our country have compared it with elephantine weights.
You can well imagine the magnitude of the achievement of our scientists in space.
On the 19th of June, our Mars Mission completed one thousand days.
You may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the Mars Mission in orbit, this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months.
Recently Indias Badminton player, Kidambi Shrikant has brought glory to the nation by winning Indonesia Open.

The more we promote sports, the more we see the spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports play an important role in personality development also.
There is a great significance of sports in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in our country.
If the children in our family are interested in sports, they should be given opportunities.
Each one should nurture dreams for the next Olympics.
My dear countrymen, let me mention once again, that this Season of Rains, with its abundance of festivals and festivities, brings with it a unique new feeling of the times.
I extend my heartiest greetings to you all, until the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, when I shall share my thoughts with you once again.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced .
I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan.
Prayer, spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during Ramzan.
This is a country where both theists and atheists idolaters and those loathing idol-worship co-exist.
We have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies, different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co-existential living .
In the ultimate , any religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill.
I, once again convey my best wishes to all.
I am glad that many people have given me feedback.
All of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me.
I could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages.
But whatever I could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music, some tried hands on a new musical instrument, some of them are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn a new language.
I am extremely happy and want to share one of the phone-calls with you.
I am Diksha Katiyal speaking.
I had almost left the habit of reading.
Therefore I decided to pick up the habit during vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison.
I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age.
Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.
I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country.
Countless great men spent their youth in jails.
We see all those great men who spent their time in jails did a great job of writing and reading.
Their writings provided a great strength and inspiration to our Freedom Movement.
Many years ago, I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.
I went to see the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarji.
Veer Savarkarji had written a book Majhi Jannmathep while in incarceration .
He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell.
He was confined to a very small cell.
A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring.
There was hardly any state in India youths from which were not exiled to the dark waters of Andamans and were forced to spend their youth in this Cellular Jail during the freedom movement.
My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
And Whats the meaning of connecting with nature
Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet.
And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, One must care about a world one will not see. This means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that.
Nature possesses a special power.
You might have also observed that whenever we feel tired and exhausted, splashing a glass of water on our face has a wonderful rejuvenating effect.
If you return after a tiring days work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air this will fill you with fresh energy.
Our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy.
All of us have experienced this but we do not register this, we do not connect this in a single thread of sequence.
Now on, kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition , a new spirit emerges from within you.
So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well.
And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment.
And if we shall protect the environment, our future generations will reap the benefits.
And, Atharva Veda, written thousands of years ago, is the most authentic guiding scripture about nature and environment.
In India, it has been said Earth is the mother and I am her son.
According to Vedas, the purity within us is because of the Earth.
The Earth is our mother and we all are her children.
We have many festivals and religious rituals which are based on worshiping nature and affection towards nature is a part of our everyday life.
This is true in case of all sections of society whether lettered or unlettered , rural or urban and even tribal communities.
But we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments.
These days , I keep receiving news from our states.
Almost in every state, a big plantation campaign gets underway with the onset of monsoon.
Millions of trees are planted.
School children, social organizations and NGOs also get connected with the campaign.
Even State Governments take an initiative. Let us also make our contribution in enhancing this campaign.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has become a well known day world over.
The whole world observes this as World Yoga Day.
In a very short time, 21st June has got worldwide recognition as World Yoga day and is connecting people.
At a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been Indias great contribution to the world.
We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga.
Like Yoga connects body, mind, heart and soul: similarly it is connecting the world now.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day.
Last year, I made announcements of some Yoga competitions and some awards as well.
We shall gradually advance in that direction.
I have received one suggestion and I compliment the gentleman who has made this creative suggestion.
It is a very interesting suggestion.
Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos.
It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga.
This will be the picture of yesterday, today and tomorrow and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow.
I invite all of you.
We are still left with about three weeks for the International Yoga Day.
This, in a way, is a movement on preventive health care.
I invite you all to get connected to it.
Ever since you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the people and when for the first time when I got a chance to address from the ramparts of Red Fort on 15th August, I had talked of cleanliness.
From then onwards, I get a chance to stay in different parts of the country.
And, I have seen that people closely follow as to what Modi does, where does Modi go, what all has Modi done.
But, I am thankful to him for having seen the campaign in this way.
This phone call will also attract your attention.
Pranam Modi ji, Im Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness.
Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness.
Many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads.
Media also prominently highlights such programmes, A few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
There cannot be any bigger pleasure for me than to know that my visit has been connected with the cleanliness campaign.
Besides usual arrangements to welcome the Prime Minister, cleanliness will also be high on the agenda.
This is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person.
Modi ji, when someone asks for your visit , your stay, you should ask as to what would be the standard of cleanliness, if they wish to invite you.
How many tonnes of waste would you present to me so that I may accordingly decide the duration of stay.
The idea is very good but I will have to think.
But, one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts.
How many people shall we be able to save from ill health.
This will be a big service to humanity.
One thing I would certainly like to say is that we should always consider these waste as resources and wealth.
Do not see it as just garbage.
Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management.
Young persons connected with Start-ups will also come forward with newer schemes and also come forward with new equipments.
The Central Government has along with State Governments and with the cooperation of municipal representatives of cities decided to launch a massive and important campaign of waste management.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, there are going to be litter bins made available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in 4000 towns of the country.
Two types of waste bins will be available, one would be of green colour and the other blue.
The waste from our kitchens, be it vegetable peels, leftover food, egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins.
This waste can be utilized in fields, and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins.
The second type of waste is like old newspapers, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, leather, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin.
This campaign was owned by Versova Residence volunteer or VRV.
Brothers and Sisters, it is with great happiness that I wish to tell you, that I am given to understand that under the aegis of Swachch Bharat Campaign, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become completely free of open defecation.
I wish to congratulate the people of Riyasi Block and also the public servants of Riyasi Block.
I congratulate one and all in the state.
My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.
Three years ago you vested the responsibility of Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the People upon me.
There have been many surveys and several opinion polls.
I see this entire process as a very healthy sign.
The works done during these years were tested on every touch stone .
It was analyzed by every segment of society.
And this is a great process in democracy.
I firmly believe that governments must be accountable in democracy and the public at large must be provided with report card of works done.
I thank those people, who provided critical and important feedback.
Constructive criticism strengthens democracy
for an aware nation, an awakened nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things.
And as I said, as an ordinary citizen, I too get affected emotionally.
Two days ago there was a launch of an analytical book on Mann Ki Baat at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it was attended by the Honble President, Honble Vice President , Madam Speaker of the Lok sabha and as an ordinary citizen and as an individual this was very inspirational event for me.
Im grateful to the Honble President, Honble Vice President and Madam Speaker that inspite of their such high stature they took out time and they accorded importance to Mann Ki Baat.
In fact it in itself has given a new dimension to Mann Ki Baat.
Some of our friends, while working on this book had discussed it with me also.
And some time ago, I was pleasantly surprised when this book was in the news again because Akbar Sahab an artist living in Abu Dhabi, proposed that he wishes to sketch the topics on which various episodes of Mann Ki Baat were based, and without taking a single rupee Akbar sahab transformed Mann Ki Baat into art as a gesture of his love.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, examination results would have arrived, the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope, pleasant fragrance, a new aroma
Come let us move ahead while loving nature in such a pleasant atmosphere.
My many felicitations and best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dearest countrymen namaskar.
I have come across the inquisitiveness of children, the ambitions of the youth, and the gist of the experience of elders
It is an inherent human nature to advise others.
While travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs, the next person immediately advises a cure.
To offer advice or suggest a solution, are part of our nature.
In the beginning, when suggestions came in response to a certain episode of Mann Ki Baat , one could discern words of advice, and you could read them too, so our team always felt that many people might have had this particular habit of proffering advice.
But when we analyzed the suggestions minutely, I really became quite emotional.
Most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives.
They are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect, capacity, ability and circumstances so that something good must happen.
And when these things came to my notice I felt that these suggestions are extraordinary.
In the previous Mann Ki Baat, some people had suggested to me that food was being wasted
These are examples of how work can be achieved with the help of society.
Today is the last day of month of April.
1st May is the foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf.
Nature has also changed the rules of the game.
The heat that we used to experience in months of May-June in our country is being felt in March-April this year.
So, when I was taking suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time.
Most of the suggestions or practices to beat summer are not new but are prevalent for a long time, however it is very useful to remember them from time to time.
Kartik and many such friends have expressed their concern about birds during the summer.
Theyve mentioned that water should be kept in trays and utensils on the balcony and on the terrace.
I have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically.
Once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray.
And also watch if the birds came or not.
We think as if it is a game going on , but in actuality, this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child's mind.
He lived till 103 years.
As part of the celebration of his 100th year the Bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
Nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world.
This effort also found a mention in the Guinness book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days.
Young friends, I want to have a chat with you too.
I am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones.
Parents also raise their children in a very protective manner.
But as a friend, I want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation.
You must try new places, new experiences and new skills.
There is huge difference between to sometime to see something on television or reading about it in the book or listening about it from acquaintances and to experiencing the same thing yourself.
The experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone.
We all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families.
Play with those poor kids, you will experience a new kind of joy, the kind you would have never experienced in your life before-thats the kind of joy youll experience
Have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Go, explore, go to the jungles.
Sometimes there are summer camps, for development of different facets of your personality.
You can participate in these camps.
Everyone has become so busy with technology in his or her own way.
Collectivity is also a way of life, collectivity is power in itself.
Secondly I had mentioned about skill acquisition, dont you feel that you should learn something new
Today is the era of competition.
You get so submerged in the preparation for the examinations, get so consumed to obtain the best grades, there are coaching classes going on even in vacations and youre worrying about the next exam
But also self-evaluate whether the human element within yourself is getting frustrated, are we not moving away from our human qualities.
Cant a little emphasis be given on this aspect in Skill development
Get away from technology, and try to spend some time with yourself.
Learn a musical instrument or learn a few sentences of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
Try to know about things about which you have no prior knowledge, it will definitely benefit you.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas.
But before leaving for a particular place, preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge, understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people, if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else
Do try to do it
of course do not travel too much in one go.
Go to a destination and spend three to four days there.
Then go to the next and spend a like duration there.
You will get to learn a lot that way.
I wish you share your travel photographs with me, it will be nice.
Make good use of the hash tag Incredible India and share your experiences.
Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity.
The new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash.
It does not need cash.
It has begun adopting digital currency.
I know you do it, but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme
It is a scheme of the Government of India.
You must be downloading the BHIM App and using it.
Ten rupees will be credited to your account from the government.
If you involve twenty persons in a day, by evening, you wouldve earned two hundred rupees.
The traders can earn, so can students.
And this scheme is valid till the 14th of October.
It will be your contribution towards making of a digital India.
Youll become a sentinel of New India.
The joy of a vacation coupled with income
Refer and earn.
Generally speaking, in our country there exists an atmosphere of disdain towards the VIP culture.
But that it runs so very deep, I just experienced, when the government recently decided that no person in India, whatsoever his status might be, will not move with a red beacon atop his vehicle.
In a way it had become a symbol of the VIP culture.
Experience tells us that whereas the red beacon used to be fixed atop the vehicle, atop the car, slowly steadily it permeated into the psyche and got firmly entrenched in the mindset.
The red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared.
I have received a very interesting phone call.
Though the caller has expressed the same apprehension.
I wish to say something on the governments ban on red beacons.
I read a line in a newspaper, Every Indian is a VIP on the road.
It made me feel very proud.
Many thanks for that.
And when Im saying EPI in place of VIP, the essence of my sentiment is clear every person is important.
We have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I maintain time again that we should keep re - visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture.
That lends us energy and inspiration.
This year, we the hundred twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya.
For one reason or the other, we confine ourselves to celebrating and observing centenaries of events mostly.
For other countries of the world, a century may be of immense significance.
Through his own conduct, he embraced those who were ostracized by society.
A thousand years ago, he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same.
We are indeed fortunate that in every era, for eradicating social evils, noble souls, great men were born in this society itself.
Now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we should gain inspiration from him in our endeavour to foster social unity, to bolster the adage unity is strength.
In memory of Saint Ramanujacharya, the government of India is releasing a stamp tomorrow, the 1st of May.
I respectfully salute Saint Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance.
You would be aware that for the facilities and respect that workers have earned, we are grateful to Babasaheb.
One can never forget the contribution of Babasaheb towards the welfare of the working class.
Today when I refer to Babasaheb, when I talk about Ramanujacharya, Im also reminded of the great 12th century saint social reformer from Karnataka Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to be part of a function.
It was the occasion of dedication to the nation of his collection of Vachana Amrit, the elixir of his spoken words.
In the 12th century, he had laid down his profound thoughts on labour workers.
He had mentioned in Kannada Kaay Kave Kailas...
it means, it is just through your perseverance that you can obtain Kailash, the abode of Shiva.
This means, it is only endeavour or Karma that leads you to attain Swarga, or heaven.
I repeatedly mention Shrameva Jayate, and Dignity of Labour.
I distinctly remember the words of Shriman Dattopant Thengdi, the founder of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the thinker, who deliberated a lot on the working class.
Today when I refer to workers, it is but natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi.
My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima.
Followers of Lord Budha across the world celebrate the festival.
And in India, Ashoks life perfectly epitomizes the transformation from war to enlightenment.
I feel fortunate that the occasion of the great festival of Budha Purnima is celebrated as Vesak day by the United Nations.
This year it will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this holy event I shall get an opportunity to pay tributes to Lord Budha in Sri Lanka.
It will be an opportune moment to re-visit his ideals.
My dear countrymen, India has always advanced on the path of progress in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas... inclusive development for all.
And when we say Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, it is not limited to the confines of India.
And very specially to our neighbouring countries.
On the 5th of May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
The capacities of this satellite and the facilities it provides will go a long way in addressing South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
Natural resources mapping, tele medicine, the field of education, deeper IT connectivity or fostering people to people contact - this satellite will prove to be a boon in the progress of the entire region.
It is an important step by India to enhance co-operation with the entire South Asia...
it is an invaluable gift.
This is an appropriate example of our commitment towards South Asia.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
It was a historic war against injustice, which was fought under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh, on this significant day.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too, has been composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
There is a very interesting fact about Gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but Knighthood was also conferred upon him by the British.
After the Jallianwallah Massacre by the British in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the legendary figures, who raised their voices in protest.
And it was at the same time, that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
The inhuman massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager, who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
On the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh Ji and his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were hanged to death by the British, and we are all aware of that.
There was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for having served Mother India - - there was no fear of death.
They had sublimated all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes inspire us to this day.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
And the entire British Empire feared these three young men.
They were in jail, certain to be hanged, but still the British remained anxious about how to deal with them.
That is why, though the scheduled date was the 24th, they were hanged on the 23rd of March.
This was done clandestinely, which is not the usual practice.
And later, their remains were brought to present day Punjab, and were secretly cremated.
Many years ago, when I first got the chance to go there, I could feel a certain vibration in that place.
And I would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to Punjab, whenever they get the chance, and visit the samadhi of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
On the one hand, brave hearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution.
In Indias struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
Gandhi returned to India in 1915, and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave the country a new inspiration.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today.
Just imagine that one man, who came to India in 1915, and had been in the country for barely two years.
it was just the beginning.
We can only imagine the hardships that he must have endured, how hard he must have had to toil.
And it was the Champaran Satyagraha that brought to the fore, Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, and his strong ability to gauge the pulse of Indian society.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his demeanour and deeds, could inspire the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate, to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the British Rule
this was a manifestation of an incredible inner strength, through which we can experience the vastness of Mahatma Gandhis great persona.
But if we reflect upon the Gandhi of a hundred years ago, the Gandhi of the Champaran Satyagraha, that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life.
This desire of 125 crore countrymen for change, the effort to change, is what will lay a strong foundation of a New India.
New India is neither a government programme, nor is it the manifesto of a political party, nor is it a project.
New India is the clarion call of 125 crore countrymen.
It is the essence of the emotions of the 125 crore Indians wanting to come together and create a magnificent India.
125 crore Indians nurture a hope, a zeal, a resolve, a desire.
That too silently, and with devotion, as if they are performing tapasya or sadhana.
There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients.
There are many who rush to donate blood, when required.
There are many who try to provide food to the hungry.
Our country is a many splendoured land.
The belief that Service to humanity is service to God, is innate to us.
If we look at it in its collectiveness, in an organised manner, it comes across as a major force.
When there is a talk of New India, its criticism, its analysis, it counter views, are but natural, and that is a fundamental of democracy.
But it is true that if 125 crore countrymen resolve, and decide to walk step by step on a path to realise that resolve, the dream of New India can be fulfilled in our lifetime.
And all these things are not necessarily achieved through the Budget, government projects, or government money.
If every citizen resolves to obey traffic rules, if every citizen resolves that he will discharge his duties honestly, if every citizen resolves that he will not use petrol or diesel one day in a week - - these are not very big things.
But these will contribute to the realisation of the dream of this country, this New India, that is being nurtured by 125 crore countrymen, and this realisation will be achieved before their eyes.
In essence, every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to all of you.
Over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment, Digidhan movement.
The poorest of the poor are making an attempt to learn, and people are gradually moving towards doing businesses without cash.
There has been a surge in various modes of digital payment after demonetisation.
The BHIM-App was launched just about two to two and a half months ago, but approximately one and half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level.
Our 125 crore countrymen, if they wish to do so, they need not wait for a year
they can do it in six months.
We can do this in our day to day lives.
You cant imagine how you can serve the country in this way and become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Recently, several Digidhan-mela programmes were organised to educate the people and to increase public awareness.
The resolve was to organise 100 such programmes all over the country.
About 80-85 programmes have already been conducted.
There was also a reward scheme.
Close to 12 and half lakh people have won prizes.
Seventy thousand traders also won the prizes instituted for them.
Each and every one of them also resolved to carry this mission forward.
The birth anniversary of Dr.
And as was decided much earlier, the Digimela will be brought to a culmination on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On the completion of a hundred days, a grand closing ceremony will be held.
There is a provision of a bumper draw also in that.
I believe that in whatever time that is left before Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary, we should popularise and promote the BHIM-App.
We should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash, of currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in.
Gayatri, a young girl from Dehradun, who is a student of class 11, has phoned in with a message: - Esteemed Principal, Prime Minister Sir, my respectful greetings to you.
I wish to share the issue close to my heart with you.
I want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness.
Every day I pass by a river, in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the agony of this young daughter, the 11th class student.
How enraged she is by seeing the river strewn with trash.
I consider this to be a good omen.
There has been an awareness ever since the launch of the Cleanliness Movement.
There has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor.
When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance.
I would urge my fellow countrymen, who have heard Gayatris message in my Mann Ki Baat today, that it should be a message to all of us.
We cant even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten.
This is not something that needs to be taught.
As it is, in our families, mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat.
On the other hand, if we are able to avoid wastage, the family too benefits economically.
So while it is good to care about society, this is beneficial to the family as well.
I am not urging too much on this issue, but I would like this awareness to spread.
I do know some young persons, who are active in such campaigns.
They have created Mobile Apps.
And when people call them about there being leftover food anywhere, they collect it and put it to good use.
They work hard, and these are our own young people.
You will find such people somewhere in each and every state of India.
The lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food.
We should take only as much as we can eat.
See, these are the pathways leading towards change.
And those who are health conscious always say that, there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate.
Now that we are talking about health, 7th April is World Health Day.
United Nations has resolved to provide universal health coverage for all by 2030.
This year on the occasion of World Health Day on the 7th of April, United Nations has focused on Depression, which is the theme this year.
We are familiar with this word, depression.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world suffer from depression.
There is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with.
The first mantra is the expression of depression instead of its suppression.
Share openly what you are going through, with your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, and teachers.
Sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness - - - students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it.
We are fortunate that we have been raised in joint families, large families, where there is communication, which eliminates the chances of getting into depression.
When the entire family is going on an outing, he just says, No, I dont want to come today.
He should be given an opportunity to be amongst people with whom he speaks openly.
Try to encourage him to express himself, to reveal and bring out his insecurities and complexes while engaging him in light-hearted happy conversation.
This is a very good way of dealing with it.
Depression can be the root cause of many mental and physical ailments.
Just as diabetes can be the root cause of all sorts of diseases, depression too, destroys all our abilities to sustain, to fight, to display courage and to take a decision.
If you are unable to express yourself to your family and friends, then do one thing, go out in society with a sense of service.
Devote yourself with all your heart into helping others and sharing their joys and sorrows.
If you try to sympathise with the sufferings of others with a sense of service, a new self-confidence will be born within you.
By connecting with others, serving them and serving them selflessly, you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind.
Yoga too is a good means for mental wellbeing.
Yoga helps in relieving tension and stress, and leads one towards a happy state of mind.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
Recently, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working-class women in our country - their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and this is a welcome trend.
They also have to share the financial responsibilities of running the household, and because of that sometimes, the newborn has to bear some injustice of neglect.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
India has taken a very important decision for these working women sisters of ours.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the auspicious day of Ram Navami on the 5th of April, Mahavir Jayanti is on the 9th of April, and on the 14th of April is the birth Anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of all these great luminaries inspire us, and give us the strength to resolve ourselves to the cause of New India.
My heartiest new year greetings for Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Varsh Pratipada, and Nav Samvatsar, which are two days from now.
After Vasant Ritu or the season of Spring, it is now the time for the ripening of the crops, and the time for the farmers to reap the benefits of their hard work.
The new year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New year is Gudi Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, for the Sindhi it is Cheti Chand, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsar Pooja in the Awadh Region, Jud-Sheetal in the Mithila region of Bihar and the festival of Satuvani in the Magadh region.
India is a country blessed with rich diversity.
My heartiest greetings and best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
After the departure of PATJHAD, when old and withered leaves fall, new leaves begin to sprout on the trees.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and orchards sport a verdant green.
The melodious chirping of birds warms the cockles of our hearts.
Not just flowers, fruits too appear to be shining bathed in the sun rays on tree branches.
The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself.
Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner.
Amir Khusro has written:Phool rahi sarson sakal banAmbwa phoote, Tesu phooleKoyal bole, daar daar,that is,Behold the mustard blooming everywhere, all aroundHere the inflorescence on the mango tree, there the Jungle Flame blossomsThe nightingale cant help but sing merrily on the branches.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a persons life.
Shobha Jalan has written to me on the NarendraModiApp that many in the public are not aware of the achievements of ISRO.
And therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile.
Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of Indias pride.
Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves.
15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India.
Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world.
And we know that over the last few years, ISRO has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours.
After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to planet Mars, recently ISRO scripted a world record in the arena of space.
In a mega mission, ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites simultaneously into space. These satellites belonged to various countries such as America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and, of course, India.
India has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go.
And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLVs 38th successive successful launch.
This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India.
This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world
the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly.
Brother sisters, one out of these 104 satellites is extremely important.
Almost immediately after its launch, our satellite has sent back some pictures.
It has commenced functioning.
It is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISROs success.
On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO.
Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another.
In the field of defence also, India has successfully test fired the Ballistic Interceptor Missile.
And you will be happy to know that hardly four or five countries in the world possess this capability.
Indias scientists have demonstrated this prowess.
Its core strength lies in the fact that if, even from a distance of 2000 km, a missile is launched to attack India, our missile can pre-emptively destroy it in the space itself.
When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy.
Inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development.
Attempting to know the universe, the laws of Nature, the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process.
This is what begets new Science, new technology.
And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in Mann Ki Baat, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase.
The country needs more and more scientists.
Todays scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, No Science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form.
All Sciences develop and are built up through experience.
Revered Bapu had also remarked, I have nothing but praise for the zeal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth.
When Science is harnessed keeping in minds the needs of common folk, when ways and means to naturally use those principles for peoples requirements are devised, when appropriate mediums and technologies are deliberated upon, it paves the way for it to be considered the most valuable contribution for general humanity.
These innovations were identified and showcased, and people were being informed about them, along with touching upon such issues as harnessing them for the use by the common people and their mass production and commercial utilization.
There are times when a problem portrays the importance of Science for finding its solution.
Systems are getting technology driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan.
The young generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets.
I believe this to be a good portent.
In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support.
For about two months now, everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each.
And through these two schemes, the process to make digital payment a mass movement has been initiated
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each.
There are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each.
Be they farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives, students all are enthusiastically participating and also getting benefits from it.
When I wanted to know the analysis, as to whether its only the young people who come forward or there are elders persons too, I was heartened to learn that among the recipients, there were 15 year old young persons, as well as elderly people aged 65-70.
Shriman Santosh Ji from Mysore, expressing joy, has written on the NarendraModiApp that under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, he received a reward of a thousand rupees.
And he derived a lot of Santosh, that is, satisfaction through his deed.
Santosh Ji, your name and your deed both are sources of SANTOSH, satisfaction for all of us.
You have done something that is exemplary and inspiring.
One young post-graduate student Pooja Nemade from Maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using RuPay Card and e-wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her.
You know that this scheme will complete its 100 days on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar, a truly memorable day.
There is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th April.
There are still about 40-45 days left for that.
Can you do one thing in the memory of Babasaheb Ambedkar
We have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Remembering him, you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the BHIM App.
teach this specially to small traders in your neighbourhood.
Give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary this time and the BHIM App.
We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands.
Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities.
The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains.
All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records.
There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi.
More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
I am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land.
The government is continuously making efforts in this regard.
Recently, an event was organised in Telengana under the leadership of the Secretary of our Ministry of Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, in which senior officers from 23 state governments participated.
We can clearly see the conversion of waste to wealth.
This has been proved too.
For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years.
After that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit.
This waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time.
This decomposed waste can be safely handled quite conveniently and can be used as NPK which is a very useful fertilizer.
Our farmers know NPK very well.
It contains nutritious elements Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium in abundance and is considered a fertiliser of very good quality in the agriculture sector.
Others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the Government.
Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight.
During the first fortnight of March, Women and Child Development Ministry along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be laying stress on the Cleanliness Campaign.
And two other ministries, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take the Cleanliness Campaign forward during the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever an Indian achieves something notable, the whole country feels a new energy and the self-confidence gets a boost.
I once again congratulate all players of our team.
The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strongly determined, courageous and possess tremendous resolve.
We get to learn something each moment from them.
Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none.
They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements.
Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently.
My heartiest congratulations to all these players.
The whole world celebrates 8th March as Womens Day.
This is no longer just a government programme.
and brought about a change in peoples thinking about our traditional beliefs and customs which have been prevalent for many years.
It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter.
In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance.
I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign.
About 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
In Kathua district in Jammu Kashmir, all departments have been connected with Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana under the Convergence Model and in addition to the convening of Gram-Sabhas, all efforts are being made by the district administrations for adoption of orphan baby girls and to ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the Har Ghar Dastak programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters.
In Rajasthan Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools, who had dropped out, in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again.
I mean to say that Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement has also developed in many shapes and forms.
This, I believe, is a healthy sign.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, these days, our country is enjoying the feast of rains on the other, every corner of the country is celebrating festivals and fairs.
And this will go on till Diwali.
Perhaps our ancestors intricately wove the annual seasonal cycle, the economy cycle and social life systems in a way that ensured, that under no circumstances, dullness crept into society.
We celebrated quite a few festivals in the days gone by.
Everyone can find solutions to present day problems from Shri Krishnas life.
And on the battlefield
Or running errands such as lifting a hillock, or at other times picking up leftover leaf plates
One feels a sense of newness in whatever he does.
And thats why today, as I converse with you, my attention is drawn towards two Mohans.
One is the Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan and the other is the Charkha bearing Mohan.
The Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna for the sea beach of Gujarat, establishing himself in the city of Dwarika, while the Mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the Yamuna, breathing his last in Delhi.
The importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge, or be it marching ahead smilingly, amidst the trials and tribulations of life, we can learn all these from Lord Krishnas lifes message.
My dear countrymen, Im referring to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
an era was born, that charted the course of human history on an altogether new path, with trail blazing accomplishments on the way.
One attribute has always been part parcel of Mahatma Gandhis being and that was his sense of service and the sense of duty towards it.
He presented shining examples through the medium of service in his own life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and society, human beings humanity was everything.
Whether it was the Phoenix Farm or the Tolstoy Farm in Africa, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he laid special emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way.
I have been extremely fortunate to have been blessed with the opportunity to visit a number of significant places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi and pay my homage.
I can say that Gandhi emphasized on the spirit of collectiveness through a sense of service.
Community service and community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real lives.
This would be the real way of paying true tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, the Karyanjali, the offering of deeds.
Opportunities like these come often we get associated with them.
But should Gandhi 150 just come go
As an individual, what can I add to the effort
What value addition could be there from my side
There could be a Ladies club
Routine tasks of a modern day Ladies club shall be taken up, but besides that, let all members of the Ladies club come together perform an activity of service
We can do a lot.
Collect old books, distribute them amongst the poor, spread the glow of knowledge.
And I do believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen are endowed with 130 crore ideas there could be 130 crore endeavours.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I was in Dandi.
In our Freedom struggle, the salt satyagrah at Dandi was an important turning point.
There Id inaugurated a state of the art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I sincerely urge you to visit at least one place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the days to come.
It could be any site... such as Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, the Ashram at Wardha or spots in Delhi related to Mahatma Gandhi.
When you visit them, do share your photographs on social media so that others may be inspired.
This time, in the India Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, a very interesting exhibition based on memories of Gandhiji was organized.
Of special interest were the Haripura Panels.
You may remember that in the Haripura Congress Session in Gujarat, Subhash Chandra Bose being elected as President is recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Session, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal of Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan, Nandlal Bose.
It was Gandhijis wish that the lifestyle of the people of India be depicted through the medium of art and this artwork may be exhibited during the session.
The very commitment reverence of Nandlal Bose have made him, along with the Constitution, immortal.
Nandlal Bose toured villages around Haripura, concluding with a few works of art canvas, depicting glimpses of life in rural India.
This invaluable artwork was a high point of discourse at Venice.
Once again, along with greetings on Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, I express my expectations from every Indian, of one resolve or the other.
One should do something for the sake of the country, society or just for someone else.
This will be a good, true genuine Karyanjali to Bapu, a tribute through a good deed.
O glorious children of Mother India, you may remember that for the last few years, we have been running a countrywide campaign Swachchata Hi Sewa, the quest for cleanliness is service, around a couple of weeks before the 2nd of October.
This time around it will commence on the 11th of September.
This time our emphasis must be on plastic.
On 15th August, I had urged you from the Red Fort... the way one hundred twenty five crore countrymen ran a campaign for cleanliness with utmost enthusiasm and energy, and toiled tirelessly towards freedom from open defecation
in a similar manner, we have to join hands in curbing single use plastic.
This campaign has enthused people from all strata of society.
Many of my merchant brothers sisters have put up a placard at their establishments, boldly mentioning that customers ought to carry shopping bags with them.
This will result in monetary savings, as well as one would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment.
This year, on the 2nd of October, when we celebrate Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we shall not only dedicate to him an India that is Open Defecation Free, but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution against plastic, by people themselves, throughout the country.
it can be transformed into fuel.
what can be a greater inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit, epigrammatic verses are, in a way, gems of wisdom.
We can derive from them whatever we need in life.
Today I want to touch upon a very important point from a Sanskrit Subhashit.
These lines were written centuries ago, but even today, carry great relevance.
There is an excellent Subhashit that mentions That is, water, grain and subhashit are the three gems found on earth.
Imprudent people call stones as gems.
In our culture much glory has been ascribed to food.
We have even converted the knowledge about food into a science.
Under the Poshan Abhiyaan campaign, nutrition made available with the help of modern scientific methods is being converted into a mass movement all over the country.
People are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and interesting ways.
In this novel scheme, during the harvest period, Anganwadi workers collect a handful of rice grain from the people.
This grain is used to make piping hot food for children and women.
In the process, he gets himself dedicated to this cause and becomes a soldier of that movement.
All of us have heard about the Ann Praashan Sanskar, the first solid morsel ritual for toddlers in families all across India.
This ritual is performed when the toddler starts feeding on solid food for the first time
solid and not liquid food
In many states, people run meal campaigns on certain dates.
If the family celebrates a birthday, certain auspicious day or observe an in- memoriam day, then the family members with self-prepared nutritious and delicious food, go to the Anganwadis and also to the schools and these family members themselves serve the children and feed them.
They not only share their happiness but in the process receive happiness magnified manifold
There is a wonderful confluence of a sense of service and satisfaction.
My Friends, there are many little things that can be employed in our countrys effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyaan across the country.
You must get connected with it, get information about this initiative, add some new facet to Poshan Abhiyaan by contributing to it.
If you manage to save a few people from malnutrition, it would mean that we can bring the country out of the circle of malnutrition.
In the last few weeks wherever I went and met people, 'Man vs.
I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world.
And look what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan.
I have seen that whenever I have had the opportunity to go as Prime Minister, and of course credit also goes to International Yoga Day, the situation now is that wherever I go in the world or interact with someone, people invariably spend close to 5-7 minutes asking questions on yoga.
There must hardly be a major world leader who has not discussed yoga with me and this has been my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel plans to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their respective languages.
Today, when there is a global churning of thought on environment, Global Warming, and Climate Change, I do hope that in such circumstances, this episode of Discovery Channel will help greatly in familiarizing the world with the message from India, the traditions of India and the empathy for nature in India's trail of glorious traditions.
It is my firm belief that people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
How many times did the shooting happen for this episode and how it happened
They ask with great curiosity.
Now, there is no secret in this.
Many people have this question in their minds, so I will unravel this secret.
Well, in a way it is no secret at all
The reality is that technology was used extensively in my conversation with Bear Grylls.
Whenever I spoke immediately there was a simultaneous translation into English or simultaneous interpretation and Bear Grylls had a small cordless instrument in his ear.
So I used to speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology.
After the broadcast of this show, a large number of people have been discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit sites associated with nature and wild life and animals.
As I have said before, and I emphasize, that you must visit the north-east in your lifetime.
Do take the family and spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, the concern and care for the environment in India seems natural.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing the tiger census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers there are in India
The tiger population in India is 2967, two thousand nine hundred sixty seven.
A few years ago, we were with great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present.
The Tiger summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia.
At this summit, a resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger population in the world.
It was resolved to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, where we accomplish goals in the quickest time possible.
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself.
Not only the tiger population in India was doubled, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
We took several innovative steps, one after the other in the Gir.
In 2007, it was decided to deploy female guards.
There were improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
But, we now have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion.
Our scriptures have provided great guidance with respect to this subject.
Our scriptures have said centuries ago: - , , That is, if there are no forests, tigers are forced to venture into the human habitat and are killed, and if there are no tigers in the forest, then man cuts the forest and destroys it, so in fact the tiger protects the forest and not that the forest protects the tiger - our forefathers explained this great truth in a befitting manner.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda delivered on September 11, 1893.
This young monk of India, who shook the conscience of the human race of the entire world, imparted onto this world a glorious identity of India.
The enslaved India which was gazed at by the world in a much distorted manner was forced to change its way of looking at India due to the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let us look anew at India which Swami Vivekananda had seen and let us put in practice the inherent strength of India realized by Swami Vivekananda.
But today I am not going to reveal its specifics
you must wait for 29thAugust
All of us with all our might must try to get rid of plastics from our home and everywhere outside our houses.
And I know that all these campaigns will make a big splash on social media.
Come, let us proceed with a new zeal, new resolve and renewed strength.
Let us proceed, enjoying our inner bliss, expressing our spirit of service.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
My fellow citizens, my namaskar to all of you
26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the nation by all of us.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy - these in a way make Republic Day also a festival of sanskaars, which makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic responsibilities, and also imparts to them the culture, moral values and norms inherent in our democracy.
But still in our country, the duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as intensively and extensively as it should be done.
This 2 minutes silence is an expression of our collective resolve and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country there is an innate respect for the military and the security forces.
I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
There are various categories of these gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal and Param Vishisht Seva Medal.
I want to urge the youth especially that since you are very active on social media, you can do one thing.
While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers, I bow to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April all these are for every family, months of most severe test
When Id declared that I would talk on this topic, many teachers, guardians and students sent me their messages, questions, suggestions and also expressed their anguish and narrated their problems.
And after going through all these outpourings, some ideas came to my mind, which I want to share with you today.
I received a telephonic message from Srishti.
You too listen to what Srishti has to say: -Sir, I want to tell you that during exam time, very often in our homes, in the neighbourhood and in our society, a very terrifying and scary atmosphere pervades.
This leads to a situation, where the students instead of feeling inspired feel tremendously down.
But there are very few people for whom there is pleasure in the exam
for most people exam means pressure
And when there is a festive mood of celebration, the best within us comes out.
The true realisation of the strength of a society also takes place during festivals.
The best of everything finds a manifestation.
Hence, during examinations too, an atmosphere of festivity should be created in the whole family, amongst friends and around the neighbourhood.
And you will see for yourself, that the pressure will be converted into pleasure.
The festive atmosphere will lead to a burden-free environment.
You will witness for yourself the ensuing change.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
And you must know that the power of memory to recall is greatest when we are relaxed.
If you are tense, then all the doors seem to be closed, nothing can enter from outside and nothing can come out from inside.
The thought process comes to a standstill and that in itself becomes a burden.
And it is by my own personal experience that Im telling you that if youre under pressure then you forget even your own things but if you are relaxed, then you cant even imagine the kind of things you are able to remember, and these become extremely useful.
It is not that you do not have the knowledge, it is not that you do not have the information, and it is not that you have not worked hard
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your wisdom, your information all these buckle under and the tension rides over you.
It seems to become a question of life and death.
See, the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year.
P.
J.
Now suppose that this failure had caused him to become dejected, to concede defeat in his life, then would India have found such a great scientist and such a glorious President
As a result, the competition has multiplied leading to a very high increase of stress in the students also.
Marks and mark-sheet serve a limited purpose.
Life is not confined to these only.
Life truly means what is the knowledge that you have acquired
If you will have faith in these things, then marks will automatically follow you and you will never have to chase marks
It is the knowledge that is going to be of use to you in life, so are skill, self-confidence and determination.
You only look at his experience, his knowledge, and the graph of his success.
And therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction.
However if you concentrate and focus only on getting marks, then you gradually go on limiting yourself and confine yourself to certain areas for earning more marks.
It is a huge psychological battle.
In reality, it is not the competition with others that takes us ahead in life but it is competing with ourselves or ANUSPARDHA, which takes our life forward.
How can tomorrow be made better than yesterday
How can a future occasion be used to improve upon the past results.
To make myself instantly clear, I shall cite an example from the field of sports.
It is a feature in the life of most of the successful players that they compete with themselves.
You couldnt sleep earlier due to exam tension, are you able to sleep now
second, that you are much worse than him
and the third that you are equal to him.
You must focus on how to improve upon your past performance and how to perform even better.
Sunder Ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.
He says that during exams, parents have a vital role to play.
Mothers who are consciously aware of and actively alert to their childrens future, play a big role in assuaging the atmosphere at home.
Once you learn to accept, maximum number of problems will be solved there and then.
I would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same with our children.
Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams
See it for yourself, the whole ambience will be transformed.
I have received an incredible phone call.
Once, when I was young, I had made an attempt to cheat in my exams.
And I started preparing most thoroughly for that.
I tried to explore and find out various methods of copying and wasted a lot of time because of that.
What you say is right.
There are times when not having enough confidence in oneself makes one crave to peep into a fellow students answer sheet, may be just to confirm if one has written the correct answer.
Sometimes it happens that our own answer is correct and the others answer is wrong.
But we somehow believe that the others actually wrong answer is the right one, which leads to our own undoing as well.
Thus unfair means lead us nowhere.
To cheat is to be cheap, so please do not cheat.
Cheating makes you bad, so stay away from it.
What kind of a Prime Minister is this, who is asking children to come out and play during exams, they might say
People generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in sporting activities, they become careless about their studies.
This notion is basically unfounded.
It is the root cause of this problem.
If one has to achieve holistic development, the fact is that there exists a huge world, a life beyond books
and this precisely is the time to learn living that life also.
This is THE time for moulding ones life.
This is what upbringing is all about.
As a matter of fact, in my opinion, three things are crucial proper rest, the other is the requisite amount of sleep, the third is the body, which is a major component, way beyond mental activity.
Other parts of the body too require physical activity.
With so much to do, have you ever thought of spending a couple of moments gazing at the sky, looking with wonder at the flora around you, lightening your spirits a bit
It relaxes you.
And for deep breathing you do not need to confine yourself to your room.
Some of you feel like studying more and more, keeping awake for late hours in the night. No.
Ensure adequate sleep for the body that is required.
It will help you avoid wastage of study time
Once a folk singer came to meet me. He asked me, How many hours do you sleep
I asked him if he was a doctor.
He said, No, but it is linked with your voice problem brought on by delivering so many election speeches.
Only when you get adequate sleep, your vocal chords will be able to rest fully.
Well, I had never given a thought to a possible connection between my sleep, my speeches and my voice.
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping all the time.
So, avoid doing that.
Do it only if you can.
Just as I advise your parents not to be burdensome to you, the same applies to me too.
Keeping your resolve in mind, with confidence in yourself, set out for your exams.
My best wishes to your.
In order to clear a test, treat the test as a festive occasion.
You will never feel a test, a test again.
Make headway with this Mantra.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years.
On this occasion I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the Nation.
It is a matter of pride and honour that with its indigenously built 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, it has carved a coveted place for itself amongst the 4 biggest Coast Guards of the world.
True in letter and spirit to the motto, securing the countrys maritime borders and maritime environment, the jawans of Coast Guard are relentlessly at work night and day, braving the most adverse conditions.
Last year, personnel of Coast Guard undertook a campaign of cleaning up of our coastal areas also, over and above their routine duties.
Thousands participated in this campaign.
Along with coastal security, they displayed concern towards coastal cleanliness and deserve accolades for their act.
Not many people would be aware that in our Coast Guard, not just men, but women too are discharging their duties and responsibilities shoulder to shoulder, and most successfully.
Our Coast Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that, they command Hovercrafts as well.
In the backdrop of the fact that maritime security today has become an issue of global concern and the excellence displayed by Coast Guard in securing Indias coast line, I extend my heartiest felicitations to them on their 40th birthday.
1st February is the festival of Vasant Panchami.
Vasant, that is Spring, is acknowledged as the best of seasons.
Vasant is RITURAJ, the king of seasons.
In our country, Saraswati Pooja is done on Vasant Panchami
It is considered an occasion to worship Vidya, knowledge.
And not just that, it is a celebration of inspiration for brave hearts.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola is a perfect example of that.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio too infuses myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination.
Last month onwards, they have started broadcasting versions in regional languages, immediately after the broadcast of my Mann Ki Baat.
I felicitate All India Radio for this self-inspired initiative from the core of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to be connected with you.
Best wishes to you.
Today is the day to give importance in our lives to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus had said - The poor do not need our favours but our acceptance with affection.
In the Gospel According to Saint Luke, it is written that Jesus not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor, and this is what real empowerment is.
A tale associated with this incident is also very popular.
Then, Jesus declared that the widow was the greatest of those donors because while the others had donated substantially, that widow had given away all she possessed.
About two days ago, I had the opportunity to launch many a developmental work in Banaras, the sacred workplace of Malviyaji.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in BHU at Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is going to be a boon for the people of not only eastern Uttar Pradesh but for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar also.
Today is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Venerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
This country can never forget Ataljis contributions.
Under his leadership, the country proudly grew in stature in the field of nuclear power also.
Whether in the role of a party leader, Member of Parliament, a minister or the Prime Minister, Atalji always established an ideal.
I salute Atalji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
As a party worker I had the privilege of working with Atalji.
Many memories emerge before my eyes.
This morning when I tweeted, I shared a video, in which you can see for yourself how as a small party worker one had the fortune of having affection showered upon him by Atalji.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In a way it is the beginning of two new schemes.
Throughout the entire country, be it villages or towns, the educated or the illiterate, there is an atmosphere of curiosity as to what is cashless, how cashless business can take place, how can one make purchases without using cash
Everybody wants to understand and learn from each other.
To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders.
starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
Everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each.
In the next 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees as gift, but you will be entitled to this gift only if you make use of mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay Card, UPI, USSD - such means and methods of digital payment.
Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is mainly for traders and businessmen.
This scheme has been designed keeping all sections of society in mind, with a special focus on the poor and the lower middle class segments.
Therefore only those will get its benefits who make a purchase worth more than 50 rupees but less than three thousand rupees.
Those who make purchases of more than three thousand rupees will not be entitled to rewards under this scheme.
Even the poor people can use USSD on simple feature or ordinary mobile phones to buy and sell goods as well as make payments and thus all of them can also become prospective beneficiaries of this reward scheme.
These 300 million people can immediately become part of this rewards scheme.
Come on, if there is a child studying in 10th or 12th standard in your family, he or she will also be able to teach you well about this.
It is as simple as sending WhatsApp messages on the mobile.
My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast.
During the past few days, the cashless transactions, or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300.
To give cashless trading a big impetus, Government of India has taken a very major decision.
The business community, our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is.
Those businessmen who adopt digital transactions, who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get Income Tax rebate.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
Ive been told that Assam Government has decided to grant a 10 discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction.
The branches of Grameen, that is, Rural Banks there getting 75 of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between January and March will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government.
They have announced that under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transaction, rewards of 5 lakh rupees will be given to villages doing 100 digital transaction till 31st March, 2017.
Assam Government has decided to reward 5 thousand rupees to the first 10 farmers as Digital Krishak Shiromani, who will buy seeds and fertilizers entirely through digital payments.
I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives.
A number of organisations have also successfully carried out many experiments to promote digital transactions amongst the rural folk and poor farmers.
I have been told that GNFC or Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Chemicals Limited, which primarily manufactures fertilizers, has installed a thousand PoS machines for sale of fertilizers for the convenience of farmers and in just a few days 35 thousand farmers were sold 5 lakh sacs of fertilizers on digital payment and this was accomplished in only two weeks
And the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of GNFC have gone up by 27 percent.
A country like India should be ahead of everybody else in this field.
Our youth have benefitted quite a lot from Start-Ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity for our youth.
They should impart to this as much strength as they can with their new ideas, technology and processes.
But we must also connect with the drive to rid the country of black money and corruption with all our might.
My dear countrymen, I request every month before Mann Ki Baat that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts
and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp, I can definitely say that 80 to 90 suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money, there was mention of demonetization.
Some have written in detail about people facing difficulties and encountering inconveniences.
The other group of correspondents have stressed that this is such a good work being carried out for the welfare of the country, such a sacred task but they have also noted that in spite of this there are many scams being committed and new avenues of dishonesty are being explored.
I am thankful to the countrymen for helping me by writing these innumerable letters to me.
The sentiment behind Gurumani Kewaljis text is being echoed in every nook and corner of the country.
All of us are experiencing it.
When the people face problems, undergo hardships, rare will be a fellow human being who will not empathise.
I feel as much pain as you do.
When a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen are standing by you, nothing is impossible. The people represent the will of the Almighty and their blessings become His blessings.
I thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this Mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal.
The law applies equally to all.
Whether it is an individual, an organisation or a political party, everyone has to abide by law and one will have to.
People, who cannot endorse corruption and black money openly, resort to searching for faults of the government relentlessly.
This government is for the sake of the people.
What are the areas of difficulty for the people
What are the rules that are creating hindrances And what are the possible solutions
The government, being a sensitive government, amends rules as required, keeping the convenience of the people as its foremost consideration, so that citizens are not subjected to hardships.
On the other hand, as Id said earlier, on the 8th to be precise, this drive, this war is an extraordinary one.
For the past 70 years, what kind of forces are involved in this murky enterprise of perfidy and corruption
How mighty are they
When I have resolved to wage battle against them, they too come up with new tactics everyday to thwart the governments efforts.
To counter these new offensives, we too have to devise appropriate new responses and antidotes.
When the opponents keep on trying out new tactics, we have to counteract decisively, since we have resolved to eradicate the corrupt, shady businesses and black money.
On the other hand, many people have mentioned in their letters all kinds of wrongdoing which are going on how newer wily ways and means are being devised.
In this context, I offer my heartiest salutations to my dear countrymen for one very remarkable thing.
Information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery.
And we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed.
Can anyone imagine the level of risk, which the aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements
They say - Modiji, do not feel exhausted, do not stop and take the most stringent measures that you can. Now that you have chosen this path, the journey should culminate at its intended and logical destination.
I specially thank writers of such letters, since their writing exudes a certain confidence, fortified with blessings.
We have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against Benami Property.
In the coming days, this law will also become operational.
For the benefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the people, whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority.
My dear countrymen, I had mentioned in last months Mann Ki Baat that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last years record in sowing.
It is a sign of good times for the agricultural sector.
It is solely on account of the tireless exertions of our countrymen that on myriad indicators, India has charted an upward trajectory in global rankings.
Indias ranking has gone up in the Doing Business Report of the World Bank.
In the World Investment Report released by UNCTAD, Indias position has risen to third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks.
In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved up 16 rungs and in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank, we have risen by 19 ranks.
There are many reports whose evaluation indicate that India is taking rapid strides ahead.
But even in such a situation, sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind.
Our government is committed to the welfare of Divyaangs.
Personally too, I have strived to lend momentum to this campaign.
My intention was to ensure that the Divyangjan secure their due rights and also the honour and dignity that they are entitled to.
Our efforts and our trust were fortified by our Divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the Paralympics.
With their triumph, not only did they do the Nation proud, they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess.
Our Divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage, a precious endowment, just as every citizen of the country is.
Today I am immensely delighted that the passing of this Law for the welfare of the Divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them.
In government jobs, the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4.
Special provisions have been provided for in this Law for their education, facilities and also for grievances.
The extent of sensitivity of the government towards the Divyaangs can be assessed by the fact that during the last two years, the central government set up 4350 camps for Divyaangs, spent 352 crore rupees for distributing implements to 5,80,000 Divyaang brothers and sisters.
The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations.
Earlier there were seven Divyaang categories
For example, categories like Thalassemia, Parkinsons, or for that matter Dwarfism have been included.
My young friends, during the last few weeks, news items coming in from the world of sports have made all of us proud.
Being Indians, it is but natural for us to feel elated.
In the cricket series against England, India has triumphed 4-0.
In this, the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise.
Test captain Virat Kohli batted extremely well and also provided inspiring leadership.
Indian Cricket teams off-spin bowler R.
The Junior Hockey Team lifted the World Cup.
This festive occasion came to us after fifteen years as the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Heartiest congratulations to these young players for this grand feat.
This achievement is a very good omen for the future of our Hockey team.
Last month our Women players too won laurels.
Indian Womens Hockey Team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago in the under-18 Asia Cup, Indian Womens Hockey Team secured the Bronze Medal.
I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, all of us were celebrating Diwali.
Some wrote poems, some drew pictures, a few created cartoons, others made videos
it was as if every home had been transformed into an army post.
And when I saw those letters, I used to be amazed at the magnitude of creativity and emotions behind this endeavour.
Your collective contribution, the sentiments of soldiers, your emotional universe dedicated to our security forces as expressed in your creativity will form the content of this volume.
A soldier wrote to me Mr. Prime Minister, we soldiers have all the festivals like Holi and Diwali on the borders.
We are devoted to defending the country every moment.
Bu we do miss our near and dear ones back home during festivals.
But, to tell you the truth, this time we did not feel so.
Never did it appear to us even once that we are not at home for the festivities.
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
When the entire nation stands by the armed forces, their might mutiplies a hundred and twenty five crore times.
A few days ago, all Pradhans from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to see me.
They were from the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They had come from different villages of the Kashmir valley, there were around 40-50 Pradhans.
I got an opportunity to speak to them at length.
But when the deliberations began, issues such as conditions in the valley, the law and order situation, the future of children came up in a natural manner.
I am feeling happy today that these Pradhans, who had come from the Kashmir valley, kept their word in letter and spirit.
They returned to their villages and made people from far and wide aware on this issue.
Recently, just a few days ago, when the Board examinations were held, 95 of the sons and daughters of Kashmir, the young students appeared in the examinations.
The sheer volume of students, who appeared in the Board Examinations, is a clear indication that our children from Jammu Kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress, to build a bright future through the medium of education.
On the 8th of November at 8 in the evening, in my Address to the Nation, I had talked about launching a mega campaign to bring about reforms in the country.
And I had also foreseen that this would result in all of us having to face various new difficulties in our day-to-day lives.
And I had stated then also that this decision was so enormous that it would take us at least 50 days to come out of its after effects and only then would we be able to move towards normalcy.
500 and 1000 rupee notes and such a vast country, wide proliferation of currencies, billions and trillions of bank notes and amidst that, this decision the whole world is minutely observing, every economist is analysing it, evaluating it.
The whole world is watching will hundred and twenty-five crore Indians finally attain success after facing numerous hardships
This question may be there in the world community.
However, India has nothing but faith and faith only and supreme confidence in her hundred and twenty five crore countrymen that they will certainly fulfill their resolve.
And our country will emerge shining like gold does after a test by fire.
And the reason for that is you, the citizens of this country. The route to this success also has been paved only because of you.
Across the country, central government, state governments, all units of the local self government institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over one and a half lakh post offices, over a lakh Bank-Mitras are relentlessly at work, day and night, with complete dedication.
In the midst of immense and varied stress, all these individuals are working hard, maintaining a calm and composed demeanour, taking it as a Yagya of Service to the Nation, an attempt towards a great transformation.
They begin work early in the morning, not knowing when they will wind up at night.
And I have seen that in the midst of such difficulties, all personnel of banks and post offices are working very hard.
And when it comes to the practice of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that in Khandwa, an old gentleman met with an accident.
Money was needed urgently.
This came to the knowledge of local bank personnel, and I was happy to learn that they personally carried and handed over cash at his home, for help in treatment.
Innumerable such incidents come to light everyday through television, media, newspapers and mutual conversations.
By misguiding the poor, enticing them through the vices of avarice and temptation, wrongfully pumping money into their bank accounts, or getting them to undertake some wrong activities, some people are trying to save their black money.
but, for Gods sake, please do not play with the lives of poor people.
My name is Aashish Paare.
I am an ordinary citizen of Village Tiraali of Tehsil Tiraali in District Harda of Madhya Pradesh.
This will further enhance peoples zeal. A cashless economy is necessary for nation building.
And I am with the whole country on this.
I am truly happy that you have done away with 1000 and 500 rupee notes.
I want to thank you wholeheartedly because you had said that good days will come, but nobody had ever thought that you would take such a big step.
You have taught a lesson to black money mongers and the corrupt through the demonetization of 1000 and 500 rupee notes.
For each and every citizen of India there could be no better days than these.
People in many countries of the world even learnt to utter the phrase Chai Par Charcha.
But, I did not know Chai Par Charcha could be linked to a marriage also.
I learnt that on 17th November, a marriage was solemnised with Chai Par Charcha in Surat.
One daughter at Surat in Gujarat served only tea to all the guests who had come to her wedding.
There was no big function, no feast or banquet because there was a shortage of cash due to demonetisation.
Whenever confronted by such difficult times, people do succeed in exploring and finding good avenues and solutions.
People are themselves finding ways.
And just look at this change.
It is the well-off people, who do not pay their taxes and bills as they have higher connections and know that nobody is going to ask or do anything against them.
All municipalities receive hardly 50 of their tax revenues.
But, this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant, people rushed to deposit their old currency notes.
47 urban institutions had received about 3 to 3. 5 thousand crore rupees in taxes last year.
You will be surprised and also happy to know that during this one week, these institutions received 13 thousand crore rupees.
Many such examples are coming to light where direct benefits of this demonetisation can clearly be seen.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are strong pillars of our economy.
Every citizen is making requisite adjustments amidst the difficulties as a result of the new changes.
A number of initiatives were taken to grant them loans under Mudra Yojana.
These small traders were provided loans worth lakhs and crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana because there are crores of such small traders and they impart momentum to the business activities worth billions of rupees.
But naturally they too had to face difficulties due to this decision.
However, I have seen that these small businessmen too have kept providing services to their customers in their own ways through the use of technology such as Mobile App, Mobile Bank and Credit Card and on the basis of mutual trust also.
And, I want to tell our small trader brothers and sisters that this is a ripe opportunity for them too to make their entry into the digital world.
You too download Apps of Banks on your mobile phones.
You too keep a POS machine for transactions in Credit Cards.
I invite you all.
I am sure you can handle the entire business in your village using this technology.
No one should exploit you.
I know, dear young men and women of my country, that you have liked my decision.
I also know that you support my decision.
I even know that you are making a big contribution in positively taking this mission forward.
But dear friends, you are my true soldiers, my true partners.
We have got a wonderful chance to serve our mother India and to take our country to new economic heights.
Dear youngsters, can you please help me
Possibly your elder brother and even your parents and uncles and aunts also may not know.
You know what an App is, what online banking is and how online ticket booking is done.
For you these are routine things and you also make use of them.
But, the great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a Cashless Society.
It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
But why should India not make a beginning in creating a less-cash society
Once we embark on our journey to create a less-cash society, the goal of cashless society will not remain very far.
You know how many opportunities there are today for a cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online banking facility.
Every bank in India has its own mobile App.
Every bank has its wallet.
Wallet simply means an e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have Rupay Cards.
Used scarcely earlier, after 8th November the poor people have started using Rupay Cards and this usage has seen almost 300 surge.
Just as there is a prepaid card for mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available in banks to facilitate expenditure.
Not only this, with the simplification of technology, we do not require any big smart phones for this purpose.
I have provided further impetus to simplifying this system even more.
All banks are engaged in this and are doing their best.
My dear young friends, despite all these things, there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters.
And I know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task.
The kind of creative messages that you send on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, anecdotes, cartoons, new imagination, jokes I am seeing all these signifying the creative power of our young generation amidst the present challenges.
But, my dear young friends, I once again tell you that I need your help in this task.
Every technology needed for online spending will definitely be available on your mobile phone.
But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from ones account, how to make payment to shopkeepers.
Once you teach the poor people about the usage of Rupay Card, they will shower their blessings upon you.
When you teach the common citizen these new techniques, he will probably become free from all his worries.
And if all the young people of India join in this great endeavour, I dont think it will take much time.
We can emerge and take our place in the world as a new modern India within a period of one month.
And you can do this through your mobile phone by going to 10 houses daily and bringing 10 families daily under the ambit of this campaign.
I invite you come, do not just support this transformation but become one of its leading soldiers and ensure that we achieve the desired transformation.
We shall carry forward this struggle to free our country from the evils of corruption and black money.
That country has brought about a big revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again earnestly appeal to you to take forward this campaign.
I invite you to work for this mission individually and collectively in every school, in every college, in every university, in NCC and in NSS.
We must take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to render a great service to our nation
this chance must not be missed.
You must have noticed, that Amitabh Ji, the most popular actor of this century, has been whole-heartedly promoting the campaign for cleanliness.
It appears as if the subject of cleanliness has become so dear to him that even on his fathers birth anniversary he remembered the Cleanliness Mission.
He has quoted one line from a poem written by Harivansh Rai Bachchan Ji wherein he said: Mitti Ka Tann, Masti Ka Mann, Kshan Bhar Jeewan, Mera Parichay.
His son Shriman Amitabh Ji, who has the cleanliness mission running in his veins, has written to me Swachchh Tann, Swachchh Mann, Swachchh Bharat, Mera Parichay.
LoPN ru] LoPN eu] LoPN Hkkjr] esjk ifjp based on Harivansh Rai Jis lines.
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai Ji.
Many thanks to all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout our country.
In India almost on all 365 days of the year, one festival or the other is celebrated in some part of the country.
We have also witnessed the courage to do away with outdated traditions.
And, the transformations in the manner of celebrating these festivals according to changing times and changing social mores have been accepted and adopted very naturally.
And this is achieved through these festivals.
Our ancestors had very scientifically encompassed all these aspects in our festivals.
Today, the whole world is talking about the environment.
Festivals have evoked a sense of responsibility towards everything, be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, etc.
Thus we had developed the tradition to observe our holidays also intertwined with the phenomena of the Universe keeping the scientific aspects in focus.
Now when we celebrate Diwali, as I said, each of our festivals carries a message and teaches us something.
The festival of lights Deepawali conveys the message of TAMSO MA JYOTIRGAMAYA, to move from darkness to light.
Every nook and corner of the house is cleaned.
We have to expand and spread this habit and tradition.
Now, the festival of Deepawali is not confined to the borders of India.
In almost all countries of the world, Deepawali is celebrated in one way or the other.
Many Governments in the world, their Parliaments and also their ruling classes are joining Deepawali festivities.
From countries of the East to those of the West, from developed nations to developing nations and from countries of Africa to Ireland everywhere we can see the glow and revelry of Deepawali.
The Prime Minister of Canada has shared on Twitter a picture of him lighting a lamp on the occasion of Diwali.
British premier Theresa May organised a reception in London involving all communities on Deepawali in which she herself participated.
And, what is that picture about
The Australian Prime Minister has conveyed his greetings to the Indian community and has called upon all sections of societies to join in the Diwali festivities in various Australian cities.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had recently come to India.
He told me that he would have to go back soon as he had to participate in Diwali celebrations there.
What I mean to say is that the festival of lights, Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration for the world community also to move from darkness to light.
I specially urge the parents and guardians to be with their children with a watchful eye when they burst firecrackers, so that there is no carelessness or undue audacity and accidents and mishaps are avoided.
In India, the celebration of Diwali lasts for a number of days.
This Chhathh Pooja is a very important festival in the Eastern parts of our country.
When I speak of the Deepawali festival or about the Chhathh Pooja this is actually an occasion to convey my best wishes to you.
I have to specially thank my countrymen and express my gratitude to them.
In the backdrop of the disturbing incidents taking place during the past few months, the soldiers of our defence forces have been sacrificing their all for our peace and happiness.
While we are celebrating Diwali in the comforts of our homes, some of these Jawans are deployed in the desert areas, others are guarding the towering Himalayan peaks, some are guarding our industrial establishments and some are maintaining security vigil at the airports.
What great responsibilities they have on their shoulders
, encompassing innumerable emotions from all
I can imagine how proud our soldiers feel at this moment.
I sleep peacefully, because you are guarding the borders thereThe mountains, the skies and the country bow to youThe mountains, the skies and the country bow to youI too bow in gratitude to you O brave soldier I too bow in gratitude to you O brave soldier
My dear countrymen, sister Shivani, whose parental side of the family as well as her family on the side of her in- laws is full of army soldiers, has sent me a telephone message.
Lets hear what this representative of a military family says:Hello Mr.
Prime Minister, I am Shivani Mohan calling.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
Im from an Army family.
My husband is an Army officer.
My Father and Father-in-law both served as Army Officers also.
So we are full of soldiers on both sides of the family.
Our Soldiers and Officers who are guarding our border have been receiving these affectionate messages and all in the Army circle are getting tremendous inspiration and encouragement.
I would also like to say that along with Army Officers and soldiers their families and their wives also make sacrifices.
Hence the entire army community is receiving a wonderful message and I would also like to wish you a Happy Diwali.
My fellow citizens, it is true that military personnel guard not only our borders, but they stand as sentinels and fighters on every front of life.
Be it a calamitous natural disaster or a law and order crisis or having to deal with enemies or to display courage in motivating misguided youth to return to the mainstream of life, Our Jawans are motivated by a sense of patriotism while rendering service to the nation.
The first state to achieve this was Sikkim, then Himachal Pradesh accomplished it and Kerala is going to be OFD on November 1st.
This village is called Badhana.
In the village at that time there was supposed to be a meeting of the Gram Sabha, so he went to the meeting where a discussion about construction of toilets was in progress.
And he found that some of the families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of funds.
Vikas Thakur demonstrated his heroics by contributing one thousand rupees each from his pocket to the 57 families and thus strengthening the Cleanliness Campaign.
And that is how Himachal Pradesh has been empowered to become an Open Defecation Free state.
It came to my attention, that in the remote forests of Kerala where there is no path to tread upon and only after walking an entire day, some villages can be reached with difficulty
a tribal village panchayat named Idmalakudi is there.
NCC cadets, NSS volunteers, Engineering students all together decided that the toilets will be constructed by them.
Work is progressing at a very rapid pace in all of these states.
I have mentioned the work being carried out in some of the places.
I convey my heartfelt thanks to all the citizens in these states who have joined in the task of eliminating from our country the darkness resulting from filth.
My fellow citizens, the government plans for the welfare of the people through many of its schemes, and usually when the second scheme follows the first one then the previous scheme is supposed to be discontinued.
But generally due attention is not paid to this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is our guide forever.
Your decisions should be based on such a benchmark.
It is the need of the times that weve to address the aspirations that have been arisen in the poor of our nation.
Now our schools are having toilets for girls as well as for boys.
In the twenty-first century, having darkness still prevailing in our villages is something that is not acceptable now.
And the rural electrification drive to free the villages of darkness, this major campaign of electrification is proceeding successfully
We are trying to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore such families and we are successfully advancing in that direction.
The small trader, the small businessman, the vegetable vendor, the milk vendor, the one running a hair cutting salon has always been entrapped in the grip of the money lender, repaying interest all his life.
The stand up scheme and Jan Dhan account scheme are aimed at freeing these people from the clutches of notorious moneylenders.
Crediting money directly into bank accounts via Aadhar aims at directly sending money to the beneficiaries.
For the common man this is an opportunity to come out of the grip of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great son of India who vowed to unite India and made this the sole object of his life.
On the one hand, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the living legend of national unity and on the other
Sardar Patel is the great personality who devoted his whole life to unite the country and, I think, he succeeded fully in this mission of his, he brought everybody together.
But we may call it the countrys misfortune that on this day itself Indira Gandhi ji was assassinated.
These atrocities against Sardars on the birth anniversary of that great personality who lived for unity, that SARDAR, is a page of history, which causes pain to all of us.
We should keep away from the idea of separatism or the attitude of separatism and also guard the country from any such ideology.
Sardar Sahebs journey started with a struggle for farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had a big role in taking the Freedom movement to the farmers.
Today, we often hear the name AMUL.
But, only a few people would know that it was only through his farsightedness that Sardar Saheb envisioned the creation of a Cooperative Milk Producers Union in Khera district, which was at that time called Kaira district.
He had given this idea in 1942 which now is before us in the shape of AMUL.
It is a living example as to how Sardar Saheb had foreseen the way to prosperity of the farmers.
I pay my respectful homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on 31st October, on National Unity Day, we must remember Sardar Saheb wherever we may be and take a resolve to preserve national unity.
My dear countrymen, during Diwali festivities, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of lights called PRAKASH UTSAV.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and blessings are very relevant even now and are a source of inspiration for humanity as a whole.
Service, truth and everybodys well-being was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev picked Bhai Laalo, as his co-worker at that crucial juncture.
In our march to achieve Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas, Co-operation from ALL, Development of ALL, we cannot have a better guiding force than Guru Nanak Dev.
I pay my deeply felt respectful homage to Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of the forthcoming Prakashotsav.
My dear countrymen, once again let us dedicate this Diwali to our Jawans. My best wishes and greetings on Diwali to all of you.
I wish that all your dreams and resolves get fulfilled in every possible way
May your lives be blessed with success and happiness.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
And, this is not only a loss for the families who have lost a son, a brother or a husband.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
We are proud of our army.
We politicians have many opportunities to speak our mind and we do speak.
Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest.
Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country.
Economic activities too should be back on track.
And during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development.
We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations.
I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities, power, laws, rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of Kashmir.
At times, people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas.
These days I get to learn quite a lot through social media.
I get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy.
Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought.
He has written I was very much distressed after the Uri attack and strongly felt like doing something.
But, I did not know how to go about it as what could a young student like me possibly do.
You have presented that with a constructive approach.
But, you must be aware that during the 1965-war, Lal bahadur Shastri Ji was leading us and then also similar feelings of rage, anger and patriotic fervour were sweeping the nation.
Everyone wanted that something must happen, must be done.
Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism.
During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work, whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement.
Now, if all of us, that is, our armed forces, people in the government, fulfill our respective responsibilities sincerely, and all of us countrymen, each citizen make some constructive contribution imbued with the feeling of patriotism, our country will most definitely scale greater heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartik has written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes who participated in the Paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit.
Not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the Paralympics.
Perhaps going beyond sporting achievements, these Paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity, towards specially-abled, DIVYANG people.
And, I shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had to say.
When the medal was awarded to her, she said Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.
There is great strength in this remark.
This time 19 athletes, including three women, took part in Paralympics from our country.
Compared to normal sporting activities, when the DIVYANG play, in addition to physical ability and sporting skills, what are needed even more are will power and resolve.
You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that our sportspersons put up their best ever performance this time and won 4 medals including two gold, one silver and one bronze.
He lost one of his hands due to suffering electric current shock.
Just think about the perseverance and the huge effort put in by him in repeating the feat of winning a second gold medal at 35 years of age 12 years after winning the first one at 23.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in High Jump.
Thangavelu had lost his right leg when he was just 5.
Even poverty could not come in the way of his resolve.
He is not from a big city, he does not come from a middle class or rich family.
Yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges, at the age of 21, through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country.
As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump.
These have not only inspired our empathy but also changed the way of looking at the DIVYANG people.
Only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these DIVYANG people in the Paralympics this time.
Olympic Games were held at the same venue only a few days ago.
Can anyone ever imagine the DIVYANG athletes breaking a record set during the general Olympic Games
It happened this time.
I once again congratulate all our Paralympic athletes and India is progressing in the direction of preparing an effective plan for developing our athletes and also the facilities for the Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
She rendered certain portions before me and when I presented her performance before other persons there, everyone was amazed.
I got an opportunity to publicly release a book that day wherein success stories from the lives of some DIVYANG persons had been compiled.
These were very inspiring incidents.
Government of India created a world record in Navsari which I believe to be very important.
The task of fitting hearing aids to 600 hearing impaired DIVYANG people in just eight hours was completed successfully.
This deed found a mention in Guinness Book of World Records.
This means that the country has taken 125 crore steps in the direction of achieving cleanliness.
This affirms that the direction we have taken is correct and also fruits of the action are very sweet.
Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role.
From the point of view of sanitation and keeping in mind the dignity of our citizens, especially the dignity of our mothers and sisters, it is necessary to put an end to the habit of defecating in the open.
And, with this in view Open Defecation Free or ODF Campaign has been launched.
A healthy competition towards achieving liberation from the habit of defecating in open has started at the levels of states, districts and the villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve very soon cent percent ODF targets.
Let us forge ahead with a strong resolution.
I specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy.
Every citizen has a right to know about the status of the cleanliness mission in his city and the Government of India has provided a dedicated telephone number 1969 for this purpose.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated his birth centenary and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet.
You must avail this facility.
Not only this, a cleanliness, that is Swachchhata App has been launched for people to lodge complaints concerning cleanliness and also to know about the progress in resolving these complaints.
especially the younger generation must utilize it optimally.
Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour.
They can sponsor young professionals willing to work for Swachchhata Mission.
They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
In this age, just as cleanliness is related to health, connecting cleanliness to a revenue model is also equally necessary.
Waste to wealth should also be one of its components.
It is, therefore, imperative that we need to move towards Waste to Compost along with the Cleanliness Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost made out of waste.
Ministers, Chief Ministers as also Mayors and Commissioners of metropolitan cities will participate in brainstorming sessions on the sole issue of cleanliness.
What can be achieved with technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this sphere
All these topics will be discussed.
And I see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in.
I recently read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University launched a Jagran Abhiyan (Awereness Campaign) to build toilets in 107 villages.
It might have come to your notice some time ago that under the leadership of Wing Commander Param Veer Singh, a team covered a distance of 2800 kilometres by swimming in Ganga from Dev Prayag to Ganga Sagar to spread the message of cleanliness.
Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments.
I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes.
You might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days.
Earlier, the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities.
Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh.
Each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that, well, we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Swachchh Bharat Mission is completing two years on this day.
This year 2nd October is a Sunday so can we involve ourselves in the cleanliness mission in some way
You involve yourself physically for 2 hours, 4 hours with cleaning work and I request you to share your cleanliness drive photo on NarendraModiApp.
Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Now, many youngsters, small groups, people from the corporate world, schools and some NGOs are jointly going to organize Joy of Giving Week from 2nd October to 8th October.
Under this campaign, food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons.
The centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay is commencing from today.
Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay, the principle of ANTYODAY these are his gifts to us.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue.
How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development
We can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor.
I respectfully pay my homage to revered Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, who has been a source of inspiration to all of us, and an embodiment of our intellectual heritage.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
My sincere effort was that Mann Ki Baat should not become a programme of praising and highlighting only governments achievements
Mann Ki Baat should not become a programme of political oneupmanship, allegations and counter allegations.
How the common man of this country keeps on inspring me all the time
Thus, Mann Ki Baat became a new opportunity of social transformation rather than just remaining a mere talk show of 15-20 minutes.
What can be more satisfying than this for any one
Mann Ki Baat, August 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar,Tomorrow, 29th August is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand.
He played a pivotal role in helping India win Hockey Gold Medals in Olympic Games of 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us cricket lovers know Bradmans name very well.
He had complimented Dhyan Chand ji by saying that he scores goals like runs.
Dhyan Chand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and nationalism.
During a match in Kolkata one player from the opposite team hit him on the head with the hockey stick.
At that point, only 10 minutes were left in the game.
And, Dhyan Chand ji scored three goals in just those ten minutes and said I avenged the hit by scoring goals.
Dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat draws near, a very large number of suggestions are received on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
These are on diverse topics.
But, I saw that this time in most of these suggestions, people had asked me to say something about the Rio Olympics.
I find it a very positive sign that our common people have such attachment and awareness about Rio Olympics and they are insisting that the Prime Minister of the country says something on this matter.
It shows that besides Cricket, our people have so much involvement in and awareness and knowledge about other sports and games also.
These Betis have once again proved that they are second to none in any respect.
It seems that our daughters in the whole of India have decided to take up the responsibility of bringing glory to the nation.
Shikhar Thakur has written on MyGov that we could have performed better at the Olympics.
He has written Respected Modi Sir, first of all, congratulations on our winning two medals at Rio.
However, I want to draw your attention to the question was our performance really good
Our parents, even today, insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports are considered a waste of time in our society.
We need to change this mindset.
Society needs motivation for this.
And, no one can do this better than you.
There is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations.
Some of our players could not even touch during these Games their own performance level which they had achieved during the domestic events in India.
In the medals chart, our tally was only two medals.
However, it is also a fact that if we look closely, we shall find that despite missing medals, Indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events.
See, our Abhinav Bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in Shooting.
The pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna met almost a similar fate in Tennis.
Our athletes this time gave a creditable performance.
Ushas feat, Lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field.
Our Womens Hockey Team qualified for the Olympic Games after a space of 36 long years.
Mens Hockey Team reached knock out stage after 36 years.
Our team is quite strong.
Many players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das gave a very good performance.
But my dear countrymen, we do have to go a long way.
And if we stick to the same routine, we may perhaps keep facing the same disappointment.
We shall prepare a roadmap on how we can do better.
We have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the Olympics in 2020, 2024, 2028.
I urge the State Governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports. What can each state do
The states can take up one or two sports of their choice and display their strength.
I urge our sports associations also to do objective and impartial brainstorming on this.
And, I also request all citizens of the country who have interest in this matter to mail their suggestions on NarendraModiApp.
But, we must prepare ourselves fully and thoroughly.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
For many years, I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers Day and that too as a student myself.
I used to learn quite a lot from those young children.
For me, 5th September was Teachers Day as well as an Education Day.
But, this time I have to leave for G-20 Summit and so felt in my heart that I should express my feelings in this regard in Mann Ki Baat today.
In our life, a teacher holds the same place which a mother does.
We have also seen such teachers who care more for their pupils than for themselves.
They devote their lives for their disciples, their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopi Chand ji is being talked about everywhere.
And, on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopi Chand ji for his hard work, his dedication towards sports and his manner of finding happiness in the success of his disciples.
We always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives.
5th September happens to be the birthday of Indias former President Dr.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this as Teachers Day.
Some times when I think of it, I remember so many incidents related with my teachers because they were our heroes in our small village.
It is as if he is, even now, teaching me in the class room.
In a way, he is conducting a correspondence course for me even today.
And, about his handwriting even at the age of 90, I marvel that he writes so beautifully whereas my own handwriting is very poor.
That is why, whenever I look at somebodys good handwriting, I have a great respect for it.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is drawing near.
Ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country, our society, our families, and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles.
By publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav, he turned this religious occasion into a festival of national awakening and social refinement.
Now, not in Maharashtra alone but in each corner of India, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated publicly.
Young people make elaborate preparations, they are full of vigour.
Some people even now try to follow the path shown by Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They organise debates on topics of public interest, and hold essay competitions and rangoli competitions.
Tableus depict the issues of social concern in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a mass campaign of public education gets underway through these Ganesh festivities.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is our birthright.
But now we live in independent India.
It is true that festivals express the vitality of a society.
Festivals infuse new life into individuals as well as the society.
Life seems to be impossible without festivals but these have to be moulded according to the needs of the changing times.
I have seen that this time, many people have written to me mentioning Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Why should we not use Ganeshji idols made of the clay from the village pond.
POP idols are not environment friendly.
He has expressed a great pain, others have also.
I request you all as to why should we not use clay in making Ganesh and Durga idols and revert to our old tradition.
Ganesh ji removes obstacles.
So, we should not make such Ganeshji idols, which create problems.
I do not know how you will take my suggestions but it is not just me but many other people saying the same thing.
Many such institutions work hard to promote Ganesh idols made from clay and they also propagate it.
Eco-friendly Ganeshotsav is also social service.
Also the clay will go back and get dissolved in the pond or the river and will thus help in protecting the environment.
I offer my best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be canonized, that is, accorded sainthood on 4th September.
Mother Teresa devoted her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
When Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India all through her life, is accorded Sainthood, it is quite natural for we Indians to feel proud.
Indian government will send an official delegation under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to represent 125 crore Indians at the canonization ceremony to be held on 4th September.
We keep learning something or the other from great men and women, saints, sages, holy people.
We shall continue to receive something, learn something from them and keep on doing some good things.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, a big transformation takes place.
Peoples power is, in a way, considered to be a divine incarnation.
Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and involve the people for this project with the cooperation of five State governments.
Pradhans of villages situated on the banks of the river Ganga were invited to Allahabad on the 20th of this month.
I also congratulate all those Ministries of the Government of India and also those ministers who turned this vision into reality.
I also want to thank the Chief Ministers of these five States for taking the vital step in the direction of making Ganga clean by involving peoples power.
My dear countrymen, certain things touch me very deeply and my heart bows in respect to those who visualize such heartwarming initiatives.
In Kabirdham district of Chhatisgarh more than 1. 25 lakh students from about 1700 schools collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Some students wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi and some in Chhatisgarhi to their parents telling them that there should be toilets in their houses.
They demanded building toilets.
Some students even wrote that they would rather go without celebrating birthday but the toilet must be constructed.
This is what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a sixteen year old girl Mallamma started a Satyagrah against her own family.
But, the family was not in a good position economically.
The village pradhan Mohammad Shafi came to know about this. He was told that Mallamma had protested to press for her demand for getting a toilet built in her house.
Now, look at the gesture of village Pradhan Mohammad Shafi, he arranged eighteen thousand rupees and got a toilet built within a week.
Just see the power and strength in Mallammas protest, and also consider the grand gesture of a village Pradhan like Mohammad Shafi.
My dear countrymen, Swachha Bharat has become the dream of each Indian.
Some Indians have made it their resolve.
Some Indians have made it their aim and purpose.
You can find details of this plan on website.
A competition will be held and the winners will be awarded prizes on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I request TV channels also to invite such films and hold a competition.
New slogans will emerge, newer methods will come to knowledge, a new inspiration will be generated and all this will happen with the great support of the people.
Lesser known artists could be taken and it is not necessary to have a big studio and a big camera.
Now, some people may wonder whether Honourable President should inaugurate a Radio Channel
But this is no ordinary Radio Channel, it is a very big and very important step.
We have Bangladesh as our neighbour.
We know that both Bangladesh and West Bengal continue to have a common cultural heritage.
So, Akashvani Maitree on this side and Bangladesh Betaar on that side will mutually share the content and Bengali speaking people on both sides will enjoy the programmes of Akashvani, that is, All India Radio.
This people to people contact is a big contribution of Akashvani.
The President launched this radio channel.
I extend my thanks to Bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative.
I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also.
My dear countrymen, although you have entrusted me with the responsibilities of Prime Minister but I also am a human being just like you.
At times, sensitive events touch me a little too deeply.
Such sentimental incidents generate new energy, give new inspiration and this is what motivates us Indians to do some remarkable things.
I salute this wonderful mother and I also salute crores of similar mothers in India who keep doing something or the other all the time for the benefit of others despite facing many difficulties themselves.
My dear countrymen, we were struggling with drought-like conditions last year but this August we have been facing the fury of floods all through.
In some parts of the country, there have been repetitive floods.
State governments, Union government, local self-government bodies, social organisations and the citizens did whatever best could be done.
Yet, even amidst the reports of these floods, some such events happened which should be remembered.
Which show the power of unity, and how big results can be achieved by working together The month of August this year has become memorable.
In August 2016, about 90 political parties in the country, many of these parties in the Parliament, which were staunch opponents of each other and which do not miss the slightest opportunity against each other, all these parties got united and passed the GST Act.
The credit for this goes to all the parties.
And, this is an example which shows that great tasks can be accomplished by working in unison to move ahead.
Similarly, about the incidents that took place in Kashmir and all that happened in Kashmir, all political parties in the country collectively expressed their views in one voice.
I have full faith in the power of my 125 crore countrymen.
Early this morning, I had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi.
And I believe, in the days to come, the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country.
The entire world will be at play...
In the days to come, wherever we are, let us do our bit to encourage our sportspersons.
Do send your best wishes to our sportspersons in Rio on the NarendraModi App.
Come, over the next few days, let us try to the fullest extent possible to make each one of our sportspersons feel proud, to reward them for their endeavours and exertions
and today, as I speak on the Rio Olympics, I would like to mention the name of a poetry lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay a student of the Punjab Central University, who has sent me a poem.
Its possible that many poets would have written poems, some may be planning to write, some may even compose their verses into songs, in all languages.
But here I would like to share with you the poem sent by Suraj Ji.
Ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalamji, which was observed last week.
And thats why Ankit asks me... What is your government doing to ensure that Abdul Kalamjis dreams come true
And technology is extremely dynamic.
If we have to match its strides and move ahead, research and innovation are the keys, these are its lifelines and moving spirit.
In the absence of research and innovation, technology will become a burden, just as still water stagnates and even stinks.
The purpose is to create an eco-system in the entire country through the Atal Innovation Mission, to forge a vibrant chain of innovation, experiment and entrepreneurship, which would also enhance the possibilities of new employment generation.
If we have to develop the next generation innovators, we shall have to link our children with it.
And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such Tinkering Labs are established in schools, those would be given 10 Lakh rupees and further 10 Lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance during the period of five years.
Similarly, innovations are directly connected to Incubation Centres.
If we have strong and well-equipped Incubation Centres, a system comes into place for innovations, for start-ups, for experimentation and to bring these efforts to a certain level.
Creation of new Incubation Centres is essential just as it is necessary to strengthen the older Incubation Centres.
We see problems in daily life.
When we fall sick, we want to get well as soon as possible and as a result pop in just any antibiotic that we can lay our hands on.
It may give you temporary succor, but we should completely stop taking antibiotics without the advice of a doctor.
Avoid it till a doctor gives you a prescription.
Do not use the short cut method
The drug then loses its efficacy and one has to fight the battle anew, develop new medicines, do new research
it takes years and till then these diseases create other complications.
Thats why we have to be very aware about that.
One more problem has presented itself.
Suppose the doctor advises that brother, take this antibiotic and he tells that 15 tablets of that to be taken over a period of five days.
I urge you to complete the entire course of medication as prescribed by the doctor.
If the medicine is taken more than what is required, that too would be in the favour of the bacteria.
And that is why, it is utmost essential to take the entire course of antibiotic medicine in terms of number of tablets as well as days.
In medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance.
Hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics.
The government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
You must have seen, these days, on the antibiotic medicine strips there is a red line to make you aware.
You must pay attention to that.
While we are on the subject of health, I would like to talk about one more issue.
I feel very concerned about the lives of pregnant women of our country.
Anemia during or after pregnancy, pregnancy related infections, high BP, any such complication can have devastating effect.
Keeping in view these issues, in the last few months, the Government of India has launched a new campaign Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign.
Under this, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will get a check-up at government health centers free of cost.
I have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month, for the sake of under privileged mothers
I do believe that you will indeed do so.
My dear countrymen, today, the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change, global warming and the environment.
These are discussed collectively in the country and across the world.
In India, this has been accorded great importance for centuries.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra too, Bhagwan Shri Krishna talks of trees.
It is proclaimed in Shukracharya Neeti that naastimulam anaushadham meaning that there is no plant that does not have medicinal values
He who donates a tree, that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children.
Therefore it is appropriate that parents desiring their well-being should plant tree and rear them like their own children.
Our scriptures like Gita, Shukracharya Niti and Anushasan Parv of the Mahabharta contain such lofty ideals.
A few days ago, I came across a mention of Sonal, a young daughter from Pune.
It touched my heart.
It is mentioned in Anushasan Parv in Mahabharata that a tree is like an offspring and becomes means of salvation in after life, Sonal has not only taken it upon herself to fulfill her parents wishes but societys expectations also.
Shri Khandu Maruti Mhatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village of of Junner Taluka of Pune got his granddaughter Sonal married in a very inspiring manner.
I saw a picture of this marriage in social media.
I was surprised to see that in the marriage festivities, instead of members of the wedding party, saplings were more visible
That picture really touches ones heart.
I think that Sonal, who herself is an agriculture graduate, came upon this idea.
And to present Mango saplings in the marriage, just think, reflects the love for nature in a brilliant manner.
In a way, Sonals marriage in an everlasting story of love for nature, I congratulate Sonal and Shriman Mhatre Ji for this innovative effort.
It can easily grow into a peoples movement for planting trees.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government planted about 2 crores sapling in the entire state on 1st July and next year they have taken a pledge to plant about 3 crores trees.
To plant 25 lakhs of sapling in Rajasthan is not a small matter
Those who know the soil conditions of Rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be.
Andhra Pradesh, too has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by the year 2029.
Gujarat too has an illustrious tradition of observing Van Mahotsav.
This year Gujarat has undertaken many projects like Aamra Van, Ekata Van and Shaheed Van as a part of Van Mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
But for me the visit to South Africa was more like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words non-violence, love and forgiveness, the inspiring faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoenix settlement where Mahatma Gandhis home is known as Sarvodaya.
I also had the good fortune of traveling from Pietermaritzburg station in the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled, and which was the site of the incidence that sowed the seed of the transformation of a Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you is the fact that this time I had an opportunity to meet those great men who had devoted their young lives for society fighting shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela for the ideals of equality and equal opportunity
who had spent 20 to 22 years of their lives in prison with Nelson Mandela, effectively sacrificing the entire period of their youth for the society.
I had the privilege of meeting these grat personalities, these close associates of Nelson Mandela such as Shriman Ahmed Kathrada, Shriman Laloo Chiba, Shriman George Bizos and Ronnie Kasrils.
There was not a single trace of desire, to get something, to become somebody even after living such a great life of Tapasaya.
The essence of performing ones duty as explained in Gita was embodied in their persona. I will remember that meeting forever.
Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest mantras for any society and government.
Her concern is very genuine.
She has made me aware of an incident: Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shilpi Varma speaking from Bengaluru.
Some days ago, I read in a news article that a lady became a victim of fraud and cheat email, lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
Being a woman, I feel an empathy with her family.
What is your opinion about such cheat and fraud emails.
And in very little time, he understood that he had been looted
You too must be getting similarly confused sometimes
These people write a letter in such style that it seems perfect.
But recently I had a pleasant experience, real pleasant experience
Student from Aligarh had come to meet me.
You should have seen the enthusiasm of those boys and girls.
They had brought a big photo album with them and their faces were lit with joy.
These were artistic painting done on the station.
What is more, they had searched for and collected the plastic bottles and oil cans lying in the garbage in the villages and by filling those with soil and planting saplings, they have transformed those pots into a vertical garden.
And by creating this vertical garden on the site of railway station, they have given it a new look.
My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country.
Think about it, we should gift such a present to our sisters, which really provides her security in future.
Not only that, we may be having in our homes a lady making food for us or a lady who cleans our house, a daughter of an impoverished mother
this is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen there are many among us who were born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of this nation who was born in free India.
The whole nation should be imbued with the spirit of those great patriots and we should once again experience anew the fragrance of freedom.
Let us all create such an atmosphere.
Independence Day should not be a government event, it should be the celebration of the entire people.
Just like Diwali, it should be our own festival.
I hope that you too become inspired with the spirit of patriotism and do something good in that vein.
Do send a picture of it on Narendra Modi app.
Let us create such an atmosphere in the nation.
You too must be having certain thoughts that you wish were proclaimed from Red Fort.
I invite you to write to me about your thoughts that I, as your representative, as your Pradhan Sevak should talk about from the Red Fort.
I do not wish that whatever I speak from the ramparts of Red Fort should just be the opinion of the Prime Minister
IN. Today the platforms of technology are such that your message can reach me very easily.
I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8 pm.
A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government.
And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry.
Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat. The mercury continues to soar.
These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation.
Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees.
In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.
5th June is World Environment Day.
On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment.
You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.
Recently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.
I carefully heard what each state had to say.
Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state.
Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings.
And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology.
I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also.
Peoples participation is a strong base for solving such problems.
And for this, I believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning, use of appropriate technology, and time-bound action, then we can achieve optimum results in drought management, for water conservation, to save every single drop of water.
Water is also an offering form the God.
And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation.
Chhattisgarh has started the Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has started the Balram Talaab Yojana- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.
Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.
This is a wonderful experience.
I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted.
We should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water.
The Almighty blesses us with water according to our needs, nature fulfils our needs.
But if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity, how can this be allowed
Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail.
I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever
I invite then as well.
My dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another.
So we will have to change some of our old habits as well.
But now times have changed.
The whole world is moving towards a cashless society.
Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money
Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society.
You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card.
In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card.
There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it
The Universal Payment Interface banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work.
It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone.
If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.
Post offices have also been geared up for banking services.
Under-hand dealings will stop
the influence of black money will be reduced.
So I appeal to my countrymen, that we should at least make a beginning.
Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease.
Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form.
But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.
My dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals...
did we get a silver or not...
To encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in ones own way.
Last week all of us were busy in the ups downs of Assam election results.
And I am confident that like this, we should all realize the importance of sports, we should encourage the people in the world of sports, encourage our sportspersons.
We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat. India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship.
and I am not talking about election results... I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class.
And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life.
in site, which drew my attention. One Mr.
Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.
33 marks.
Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90 by four marks.
I dont know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.
Gaurav, I have read your letter very carefully.
And I feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours
like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain.
We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything.
It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.
Santosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines.
He says that the people around him just dont accept the results.
I dont remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life.
Someone said, yellow here would have been better in place of blue.
Someone said, This line would have been better situated there instead of here.
I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.
everyone just spoke of touching it up.
And there must be crores of students like you.
You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others.
All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, dont lose your balance.
Everyone expresses their expectations
just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better.
But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new.
The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor.
There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley.
But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world.
Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music.
It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings.
But Ustad Bismillah Khans mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world
It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more.
The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness.
21st June is the International Day for Yog.
People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it.
To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life.
Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog.
And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration.
These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individuals life.
I do hope that on 21st June, wherever you may be, please take the initiative
Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices.
Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June.
I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June.
My dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly.
I had given all of you a mobile number earlier, which you could use for listening to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on that number.
But now we have made it a lot simpler.
Now, to be able to listen to this programme, all you have to do is to dial just four digits.
By giving a missed call on this number, you will be able to listen to Mann Ki Baat at any time, wherever you are and in any language of your choice.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again
Please dont forget what I had said about water.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
As usual, you and I eagerly keep waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
This time too, numerous letters, comments phone calls have poured in full of stories, suggestions inspiration everybody wants to do something or the other
It is heartwarming to see them discuss books published on subjects such as Science, Technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life-sketches and so on.
Some have advised me to dwell upon many other books.
But I must candidly admit here that I am not able to devote much time to reading books these days.
Why dont we create a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App, so that, whenever we read a book, we write about it and discuss it on this platform
And you can even suggest an apt name for our book corner.
I want this book corner to be an active forum for readers writers alike.
Many an informed, effective endeavour is afoot across the country.
People have shared information on traditional methods.
Witnessing the might of the collective is in itself heartwarming satisfying. A case in point is village Aara Keram under the Ormanjhi block, not very far from Ranchi in Jharkhand.
And you will be happy to know that the beautiful North Eastern State of Meghalaya has become the first state to have formulated its own water-policy.
I congratulate the Government of Meghalaya.
In Haryana, crops that require meagre water are being encouraged.
I specially congratulate the Haryana Government for establishing a connect with the farmers to wean them away from conventional modes of farming towards crops that do not require much water.
It is the season of festivals.
Many fairs are held on these occasions.
Why dont we use these fairs to spread the message of water conservation
All sections of society turn up in fairs in large numbers.
Here, we can effectively spread awareness on the need to save water through forums such as exhibitions and street plays, thus using the festive fervour to convey the message of water conservation with ease.
Friends, certain turns in life make our hearts swell with joy zest
especially our childrens achievements, their feats fill us up with energy.
And that is why today, I feel like mentioning about a few children.
They are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguli Hrithik Alaamandaa.
What I tell you about them will fill your hearts with pride verve as well.
All of us know that just the word CANCER is more than enough to scare the world.
In sports and games, we often get to see a player becoming a champion after winning a tournament or bagging a medal
this was a rare occasion when the participants were champions BEFORE they entered the contest...
they were champions of LIFE, the battle.
Actually, this month, the World Childrens Winners Games were held in Moscow.
In this tournament, sports games such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football table-tennis are organized.
All Ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Out of these, some players even won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I firmly believe that you must have felt immensely proud on Indias achievement beyond the skies...
Chandrayaan II.
People from across the country, such as Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
In fact, in the realms of Space, 2019 has been a very fruitful year for India.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March.
India became the fourth country in the world, possessing this capacity.
And now, on the 22nd of July, the nation watched with pride Chandrayaan II taking strides into space from Sriharikota.
Visuals of Chandrayaan II lifting off filled our countrymens hearts with glory, zest and joy.
Chandrayaan II is a mission that is special on many counts.
You will be glad to know that Chandrayaan II is INDIAN to the core.
but always remember- the capacity to overcome them resides within us.
I fervently hope that the Chandrayaan II mission will inspire our youth towards Science Innovation.
After all, Science is the path to progress.
We are now expectantly waiting for the month of September, when Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan will land on Lunar surface.
Through Mann Ki Baat today, I wish to share with students, my young friends, information on a very interesting competition ...
Your inquisitiveness regarding Space, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the salient features of this uiz Competition.
I urge my young friends, students to participate in this competition and make it interesting and memorable through their participation.
I specially call upon schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers mentors to strive hard to ensure victory for their respective schools.
Encourage all students to join.
For these winners, it will be a historic event of their life.
But for that, you will have to participate in the uiz competition, score the highest be a winner.
let us encourage inspire as many friends fellow students to do the same.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our chain of Mann Ki Baat has lent pace to the cleanliness campaign from time to time.
From over bridges to school walls to hutments he gave a free hand to his talent, garnering huge public support on the way, on the lines of an effective campaign.
Remember how, during the Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings
I came to know that Yogesh Saini his team played a stellar role in it.
It is imperative that the culture of transforming waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move ahead on the path of converting garbage to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting comment on My gov.
This comment came from Brother Muhammad Aslam who stays in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to the programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to let you know that I played a positive active role in organizing the community mobilisation programme- Back to Village in my state Jammu Kashmir.
This programme was organized in the month of June.
I feel such programmes should be organized every quarter.
Simultaneously, there should be a provision for online monitoring too.
The people of Kashmir are eager to join the national main stream, their enthusiasm is reflected in the mechanism of this programme.
For the first time, senior officials reached the villages, directly, even those officials who had never visited a village were available to the villagers at their doorsteps, to judge for themselves to gauge the obstacles in the path of progress and to remove the hurdles.
How to increase their income
And how the facilities rendered by panchayats can affect the day to day life, were topics that were discussed and people too interacted in a participatory fashion telling about their problems.
Literacy, sex ratio, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, Girl education, senior citizens concerns etc.
Friends, this programme was not a mere Government formality that officials roam around the village and return to base, instead of this the officials spent two days and a night at the panchayat, enabling them to spend time in the village and meet almost every denizen of the village and to reach across to every establishment in the village.
To make this programme even more interesting many other means were employed.
Many sports competitions for kids were organized under the aegis of Khelo India.
Sports Kits, MNREGA job cards and SCST certificates were distributed.
Programmes like these and peoples participation or stake holding indicates that our brothers and sisters in Kashmir want good Governance and proves the dictum that the power of development is stronger than the might of bullets and bombs.
It is clear that those who wish to spread hatred en route to development, pose hurdles will never succeed in their sinister plans.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatraya Ramchandra Bendre, gyanpith laureate and poet has described the significance of the month of Sawan in this manner- in his poem.
Meaning that the relationship between drizzling rain and stream of water is wondrous and earth gets bedazzled by such spectacle
In entire India, people of different cultures and languages, celebrate the onset of rainy season in their own fashion.
Whenever we look around us in this season it appears as if earth has draped itself in a sheet of greenery
There is generation of renewed energy all around us.
In this pious season many devotees perform the Kanwad Yatra and many proceed on the Amarnath pilgrimage, many observe fasts and eagerly wait for festivals like Janamasthmi and Nag Panchmi.
It is during this season that the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizing the bond between a brother and sister also falls.
While we are talking of the month of sawan, you will be glad to learn that the number of pilgrims in the Amarnath Yatra this year has been the greatest in the past 4 years.
A total of 3 lakh pilgrims have had the darshan of the holy Amarnath shrine from 1st July till now.
In 2015, the number of devotees who performed this pilgrimage over 60 days has been crossed over by the number of pilgrims in mere 28 days this year
I would especially like to thank the hospitality of the people of Jammu- Kashmir while referring to successful organization of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return after performing this pilgrimage become imbued with the feelings of warmth and kinship displayed by the people of the state.
These are portents of booming tourism in the future.
On the other hand, heavy rainfall in many parts of the country has resulted in countrymen suffering due to floods.
My dear countrymen, where to begin Mann Ki Baat and where to end it, is a difficult task
The next edition of Mann ki Baat will be in 2016.
We celebrate a whole lot of festivals.
At times it feels India is one such country which has a festival driven economy.
It becomes a source of the economic activities for even the poor sections of the society.
You are aware that I use a lot of technology which provides me lots of information.
Ganesh V.
Savleshwarkar has written to me from Pune that this season is a tourist season.
A large number of foreign and domestic tourists travel across the country.
People also travel to celebrate Christmas vacations.
Sometimes we hear disappointing news about our nation.
But there are thousands of people like Dilip Singh who are doing something good for the nation on their own.
Better education, best talent and new opportunities of employment are being created.
When the world celebrated International Yoga Diwas and the entire world got associated with it, we became proud of our country.
Such emotions arise when we see the enormity of our nation.
The concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
This is also a kind of service.
I too have tried to do this work from my end.
I cannot do everything alone by myself.
My dear young friends, I had some preliminary discussions about Start-up India, Stand-up India in my speech on 15th August from the Red Fort.
After that all government departments started discussing it.
Can India become a Start-up Capital
Can our states work together for new Start-ups for youth, and encourage innovations with start-ups, be it in the manufacturing sector, service sector or agriculture.
This thinking is wrong.
The Indian youth all over the country has talent, all they need is opportunities.
This Start-up India, Stand-up India should not be limited to a few cities only.
It should spread to every corner of India.
And I will request the state governments to take this forward.
I will definitely interact with you on 16th January and will discuss this in detail.
Your suggestions are always welcome.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him.
Since 1995, 12th January, the birth Anniversary of Vivekananda is celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year it will be organized from 12-16th January in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh.
A mini-India will be created there.
They will share dreams together.
A feeling of determination will be experienced.
Can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival
I think it was a great initiative by you.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You are yourself working in this field.
You understand everything and you must have faced a lot of difficulties too.
At some point we heard handicapped, then it was disabled and somewhere it is specially-abled, so many terms have been used.
It is true that words have their own significance.
This year when the government of India started the Sugamya India programme.
I hope that you will take this forward.
That day we started the Sugamya Bharat campaign.
Under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the Divyang people.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, everywhere ramps, accessible parking, accessible lifts, Braille, many amenities will be made available.
We have taken the initiative.
We are receiving public participation too.
People like it.
They should not have a dead existence in government files.
After all, these schemes are meant for common man, the poor people.
In the past few days the government has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes reach out to the rightful owners.
In our country, we give subsidy for the gas cylinders.
If this subsidy reached people on time or not
The Government has made some changes in the scheme.
The government undertook the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of Jan Dhan Account or Aadhar Card etc.
I am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme which has been implemented successfully.
No middlemen nor any recommendation, nor any possibility of corruption. On one hand was the Aadhar Card Scheme, and on the other was the Jan Dhan Account. Thirdly the state and Indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries.
In many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts.
There were complaints about student scholarships too, they too are being transferred into their accounts.
Till now around 40,000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes.
According to my rough estimate, around 35-40 schemes are now under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is the golden moment in the life of Indian democracy.
We organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience.
It was an excellent discussion.
At the most, whenever there are elections, then we see advertisement all around us, they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty.
There is a lot of talk about duties during elections, but why not discuss our duties in general life too.
This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then can we make 26th January a medium to organize debates, poetry, slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools, colleges, villages, cities and various organizations and societies.
If 125 crore Indians take dutiful steps one after the other, they can make history.
But at least lets start with discussions.
You must have had the opportunity to visit some other places.
Festivals have their own significance in social life.
There is continuous news of natural calamities from various parts of the world.
And sometimes the news is very bizarre, never seen or never heard of.
We are now realizing the effects of climate change very rapidly.
The Central government too has joined them in their efforts.
Now when there are talks of such crisis all around, we feel the need to bring in a lot of change.
This is a good beginning.
Today, I received a phone call from Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab. I am Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am happy to hear your message.
I am happy that, you are a farmer engaged in organic farming.
And not just that, you also understand the problems of the farmers really well.
Your concerns are right but this just does not happen in Punjab and Haryana alone.
It is a practice in the entire country and traditionally we follow this method of burning off the remains of the crops or the straw.
Initially we were not aware of the damage.
We did it because the others did it.
Secondly, people are not aware of the available solutions.
But the concern you have expressed is genuine.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are themselves very valuable.
Secondly because of burning this the top soil gets burnt.
Even if the heart is strong, we will not be able to survive.
So burning the stump of crops not only burns them, it burns the skin of our motherland.
So it can be used not only to feed the animals, and save our land but also to create good fertilizer.
If this is added to the soil, it will be doubly beneficial.
Once I had the opportunity of talking to farmers involved in Banana cultivation.
And they shared a very good experience.
To clear the stumps from the fields they had to spend 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 rupees per hectare.
And till the time the people who would clear these stumps would not come with tractors, the stumps would remain standing for long.
But some farmers chopped those stumps into 6-6, 8-8 inch pieces and buried them inside the soil.
Last time in Mann ki Baat I talked about organ donation.
I talked about the NOTO helpline for Organ donation.
Many famous personalities including actress Raveena Tandon became a part of it.
Organ Donation can save many valuable lives.
Organ donation can bring about immortality.
When an organ moves from one body to another it gets a new life but the person receiving it gets a new lease of life.
There can be no greater donation than this.
I would like to inform those waiting for organs and those willing to donate that a national registry for organ transplantation has been launched on 27th November.
It is my faith that awareness in this field will increase and the needful will receive the best of help in true sense.
This help cannot be obtained till someone donates their organs.
Like I said earlier, 3rd December is being celebrated as International Day of People with Disability.
People with physical and mental disabilities are capable of unparalleled courage and capability.
Sometimes it hurts when they are laughed at.
We start crying even when small misfortune befalls us.
Then we realize, our problem is so small but how does he survive
How does he live
Their will power, their struggle with life and their zeal to transform crisis into opportunity is worth lot of praise.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
He is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists had shot Jawed Ahmed in Kashmir.
He was a victim of the terrorists but he survived.
But the bullet damaged his kidney and a part of the intestine was lost.
He suffered serious spinal injury.
He lost the ability to stand on his own feet, but Jawed Ahmed did not concede defeat.
The grave injury caused by terrorism could not deter him.
How to improve the infrastructure for the physically challenged How to develop systems for the disabled in government offices and public spaces
Is his life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Jawed Ahmed, his dedication and devotion especially on every 3rd December.
I am mentioning just the case of Jawed because of lack of time but such lights of inspiration are prevalent in every corner of the country.
Our country is very large.
There are many things for which we are dependent on the government.
And that one experience shapes our perception of the government system for a lifetime.
They do a lot of social work in India.
There might be lakhs and lakhs of people around us.
Let us show respect to such individuals. Such individuals lend power to our nation.
They are partners to the joys and sorrows of others.
I applaud all such ASHA workers through the story of Jamuna Mani.
Share these e-books, discuss these books and some enthusiastic young man can narrate these to the students of VIII, I or standard in the nearby schools.
So you can become a social teacher in the truest sense.
I invite you to come and become a part of nation building.
My dear countryman, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Some friend of mine had sent me a link and I had the opportunity to see it.
But she is doing something which no one would have thought of.
She is utilizing the Solar Energy of the Sun to illuminate the houses of the poor.
She is fighting darkness and bringing light to her own name.
She has formed a Samiti (committee) of women who manufacture lanterns that run on Solar Energy.
They rent the lantern for Rs. 100- per month.
See what the big people of the world do for climate change.
I received a phone call from Mr.
But the start has been good.
Till now 66 lakh people have received 42,000 crore rupees through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
It can be a washer man, a barber, a newspaper vendor, milkman, just about anybody engaged in small enterprise.
Abhishek has himself narrated his excitement.
I too keep receiving various news.
Someone just told me that there is one Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He received a loan of 8.
I had told about my cleanliness campaign that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhonsle proved it.
But I want that this scheme is promoted more.
What should the structure of the programme be like
What should be the logo
But I am expecting more suggestions.
I expect more specific schemes.
I have been told that the participants will all receive a certificate.
Many big prizes have been announced.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winters are about to start.
Create this type of mood in the family, make it a celebration, all should get together for an hour to do these exercises.
See how there will be an awakening.
And see how your body helps you throughout the day.
So make a good habit in this good season.
My good wishes again to all my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind
Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat one year, many thoughts.
Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual.
My experience of Mann Ki Baat made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them.
Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government.
It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom.
Who would have thought that the Mann Ki Baat will become a source of information
But this has happened.
In the same way Mann Ki Baat became a platform to express the power of society.
I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became. The whole world was amazed.
This was a kind of a silent revolution.
People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India.
Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage.
All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny.
The people themselves took the task forward. In October last year, I did my first Mann Ki Baat.
In that edition I had mentioned about Gandhi Jayanti. I told people that we are celebrating Gandhijis birth Anniversary on 2nd October.
There was a time when there was Khadi for Nation
Isnt it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion
I requested the people to buy Khadi and to do their bit.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled.
Now see, there was no government advertisement.
Nor were lakhs and crores spent.
A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.
Once I had mentioned in Mann Ki Baat about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit.
Shouldnt they be getting gas cylinders
today I can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people.
V, a retired teacher, a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy.
The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy.
But then they did give up their subsidy.
Isnt it a silent revolution
Isnt it a demonstration of the peoples power
The governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities, energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration.
Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this
This time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat.
There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call.
This is a pleasant experience in itself.
People of all age groups have sent messages.
I listened to some message personally and I liked them.
My team is working on the others.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy.
It feels as if there is negativity all around us.
But my experience was different.
These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way.
Just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude, this is the nations greatest wealth.
There were serious complaints in about 1-2 phone calls.
But more than 90 things were energizing and pleasant.
V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio.
Pawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message.
I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme Mann Ki Baat to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali.
This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families.
Pawan, I believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of India.
I request the citizens to follow Pawans advice in the coming festivals. If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces.
The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies.
We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965.
To commemorate this event an exhibition named Shouryanjali had been organized near India Gate.
What was it that was not there
If you want to create history, then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past.
History binds us to our roots.
If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end.
And do not be in haste like me.
I came back in 2-2.
This child is absolutely right.
I dont get offended by all this.
I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.
Look at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this.
This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment thats building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness.
This will also compel the governments to work.
We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
He once said, if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later.
Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.
My dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us.
It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men.
Everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us.
In the coming days, we will get to remember a lot of these great men.
25th September we shall remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on the 2nd of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October and there are innumerable names, I have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems.
I would like to request you for 2nd October specially.
Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.
Our weavers put in a lot of hard work.
50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver.
It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali.
Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing.
I wish to share this joy with you as well.
I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything.
I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash babus family members.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I want to request the Prime Minister to make the young generation aware about voters registration, which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government.
Thank you Bhargavi talked about registering the names in the voters list and the voting process.
The voting percentage is also increasing and for this I want to congratulate the Election Commission of India.
Up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years.
It is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do.
I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food.
One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7. He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University.
I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science.
She is 9 years old.
When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old.
I asked where she learned it from.
So, I thought I must share it with you.
We do a lot of things, other than what you see on the TV and read in the newspapers.
I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly program, have to make adjustments to my time-table.
Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so.
For now, we will stick to the one month program only.
He started his own show from Germany and he would constantly update the Indian citizens about the Independence movement through radio.
He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin.
English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.
I have also completed a year since I started Mann Ki Baat.
We shall meet next month again for Mann Ki Baat.
Your suggestions should keep coming in.
The government gets benefited by your suggestions.
It helps to initiate improvement.
Your contribution is priceless for me.
Once again, many congratulations to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2015 My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
I have the opportunity to be amongst you to share my Mann Ki Baat once again.
Far south, the people are engrossed in Onam festivities and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The government of India has launched various schemes of social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers.
I had made a humble request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift.
I consider this as a positive sign.
I offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today when I talk to you, I want to mention that around a year back the Jan Dhan Yojana was started at a large scale.
Banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor, the programme of Bank Mitra is being strengthened.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh Bank Mitras are serving in the country.
The youth have got employment this way.
You will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect the Banking sector, Economy and the Poor People, over 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy camps have been organized.
I have brought them to you, now it is your job to keep them going.
All of our accounts should be kept active.
Sometime back, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their choice of words, their way of talking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, its sublimity, its lyricism, I could experience it all.
I have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and I am glad to be invited at Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India visited Bodh Gaya.
And now, I will be going there with these scholars, this gives me immense happiness.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I would again like to especially share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me speak in the parliament, in public forums or Mann Ki Baat about it.
My dear farmers, you should not be misled and definitely never be scared.
And I do not wish to give anyone the opportunity to mislead you and scare you.
We had issued an ordinance.
Tomorrow, on August 31st the deadline for this ordinance ends.
I have decided that let this ordinance be lapsed.
I want to reassure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not merely a slogan, it is our guiding Mantra.
I have to say something more.
Two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war.
And whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also but natural that we remember his slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is also natural that we remember our Jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our Tricolor Flag.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war.
I pay my tribute to the brave soldiers.
May we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history.
Like I had the chance of meeting the Sufi scholars similarly I had another great experience. I had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country.
I had the opportunity to hear them and I was very happy to know that India is doing commendable research in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing some excellent work.
Now the challenge is to take these researches to the common man.
How to convert these theories into machineries
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat I had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science.
After this meeting I felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities.
I especially want to make a point to my young friends.
These days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in India.
Why dont we associate each festival with cleaniness
This year the rains have started on a good note.
We have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
Poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food.
The good news for me is that there has been an increase of approximately 50 in the production of pulses and an increase of around 33 in the production of oilseeds.
I would especially like to congratulate and compliment all my farmer brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land, our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree.
During the Kargil war, each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies.
It is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world.
Hence, I would like to salute all these valiant warriors on this occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas.
We have received quite a few suggestions from Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai in this regard.
I believe that you will send your good suggestions.
I would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern.
I neither want to sermonize nor I am trying to find an escape route towards my responsibilities pertaining to state government, central government or units of local self-government institutions.
Two days ago a visual of an accident in Delhi caught my attention, wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident.
He did not receive any help from the passers-by.
In general also I have noticed that I have been receiving suggestions to speak on road safety and make the people aware of this.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay from Bengaluru, Ameya Joshi from Pune or Prasanna Kakunje from Mudbidri, Karnataka - all these all people have written to me...
We are witnessing an accident every minute in our country.
Due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country.
It is a matter of huge concern that out of these deaths, nearly one third of the victims comprise the youth ranging from 15 to 25 years of age group, and such death shakes the very foundation of an entire family.
I have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
They are working on Brother Number One operation in which the best brother has to gift one toilet to his sister.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, they are influencing all the brothers to gift toilet to their sisters, so that all the mothers and sisters of the district avoid going to toilet in the open.
There exists a small village called Keshla in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh.
The inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village.
Now, nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written to me on the North-East related issues and problems.
Instead it was decided to send the government officials and their team on a seven days camp to North-East states like Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim.
This initiative will bring a fruitful result in the near future.
Youth is losing their interest in science, which is a matter of great concern.
Science and Technology is a type of DNA for development.
I always press upon the IAS officers of our government, who have reached such heights with their vast intellect and education that they should visit the nearby schools and colleges and share their knowledge for just two to four hours in a week.
We have auspiciously inaugurated this scheme and the villages will get a supply of 24 hours electricity in the coming years.
The students of the villages should not be affected with the shortage of electricity during their exams.
There should be enough electricity for starting a small industry.
Today, the villagers have to go to other villagers for charging their mobile phones.
The villages should be provided with all the facilities that are available in the cities.
For this purpose, we have launched Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
Today, through Mann ki Baat, I felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts.
In a way, in our country the months of August and September are the months for celebration of festivals.
There are lots of festivals in these months.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
It used to be a chat in a genial atmosphere amidst the warmth of ones own family of 130 crore countrymen
at times our expressions would turn into an inspiration for someone close to us.
I just used my words and my voice and that is why, I was not missing the programme...
I was undergoing a bout of emptiness.
Anyway, finally the opportunity has dawned.
In a family like atmosphere, these plain, simple reflections become the reason for change in life, in society.
Begetting a new spirit, in a way fortifying the spirit of New India, let us wish this endeavour embarks upon its onward journey.
Over the last few months, many messages have poured in, with people stating that they have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
There are times when I feel that this is my journey from the self to the unabridged whole
my journey from I to We.
For me, this nonvocal conversation with you was a part of my feelings during my spiritual journey.
Amidst hectic Election engagements, many people asked me a flurry of questions on why I had gone up to Kedarnath.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet myself.
In a way, I undertook the journey to meet my inner self.
There are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process.
People bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society they also come out with solutions for the same.
it is fascinating to see that in the same breath, they express directly or indirectly, a relevant solution or two, one suggestion or the other, or even an idea
This means, I can closely get a fair idea of your point, in terms of extrapolating a solution to a certain problem on a society- wide scale.
Mann Ki Baatis like a mirror to the country our society.
It conveys to us that there is no dearth of inner fortitude, strength talent within our countrymen.
The need of the hour is to synergise those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that a 130 crore countrymen wish to be, strongly and actively, a part of the nations progress.
When I analyse this, you can visualise how heartening it must be for me, what a source of energy it is for me.
This trust was the trust of your foundation.
With this sentiment, come, lets take Mann Ki Baat forward.
And precisely for that, the country sacrificed one full Election, not for her own sake, but for the sake of protecting democracy.
Perhaps, nowhere else in the world had citizens voted, without bothering about other rights requirements, just for the sake of saving democracy.
And the country had witnessed one such Election in 77.
In the 2019 Loksabha Election, India saw over 61 crore voters exercising their franchise...
We can think of this figure as one ordinary but if I place it in a global perspective, if you exclude China, the number of people who voted in India exceeds the population of any other country in the world.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Election is more than the entire population of America, close to double the figure.
The total number of voters in India exceeds the entire population of Europe.
This stands for the sheer size spread of our Democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election in history by far, was the largest democratic Election ever held in the world.
You can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise.
Lakhs of teachers, officers staff strived day night to make it possible.
In order to successfully conclude this Mahayagya, on the one hand, whereas close to three lakh paramilitary personnel discharged their duty on the other, 20 lakh Police personnel of various states too, persevered with due diligence.
It is on account of these people that this time voting took place on a larger scale compared to the previous Election.
For the voting, there were around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines...
you can imagine the gargantuan task
All this was done, just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, just for a lone woman voter, a polling station was created.
You will be amazed to know that it took a journey of two days for personnel of the Election Commission, just to reach there...
this is honour to democracy at its best.
The worlds highest located polling station too, is in India.
At an altitude of 15,000 feet, it is located in the Lahaul Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
This time the ratio of men women who voted was almost the same.
Another encouraging fact is that, today, there are a record 78 women Members of Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person connected with the electioneering process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you may often have heard me say No bouquet, just a book
I had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies.
Since then, people have been offering books at many a place.
His stories embody the collective psyche, the cumulative being of the country, of the land.
While reading one of his stories Nashaa, I couldnt help but notice the scourge of economic disparity plaguing society.
I was reminded of my younger days...
how debates on this subject would carry on through entire nights
The moral of this story featuring the landholders son Eeshwari and Beer from a poor family is that if you are not careful enough, you will never know when the bane of bad company engulfs you.
the sensitivity of a young lad, his unsullied love for his grandmother, such maturity at that early age
When 4-5 years old Hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs, indeed, it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle.
Halku the farmer is happy even after his crops are destroyed by frost, because now he will not be forced to sleep in his fields in the cold winter.
Though these stories were written about a century ago but remain relevant all the same even today.
K.
Muralidharan and P.
Today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path.
The Vaanche Gujarat campaign carried out in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Participants hailing from every age group in lakhs, participated in this campaign to read books.
I will still urge you in today's digital world and in the time of Google Guru, to take some time out from your daily routine and devote it to the book.
You will really enjoy it a lot and do write about whichever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat' also get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues, which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water.
Water is of great importance in our culture.
Please bless us like a mother and may your blessings continue on to be showered upon us.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country.
Just and just 8
Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem.
I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.
Therefore keeping the importance of water in mind, a new Jalashakti ministry has been created in the country.
This will allow faster decision-making on all subjects related to water.
A few days ago I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans across the country.
That in order to save water, to collect water, to save the very drops of the rainwater, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers.
I am happy that they have shown exemplary enthusiasm on this front and on 22nd of this month crores of people contributed free labour, Shramdaan across thousands of panchayats.
People in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater.
Today, I want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme.
Come lets listen to what the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katakmasandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has to say to all of us through this message:DILIP KUMAR RAVIDASThis is Birsa Munda's land, where cohabiting in harmony with nature is a part of the culture.
The people here, once again, are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
For my part I wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism.
And it seems that the denizens of the villages have become involved in the competition for raising a water temple, in their respective villages.
As Ive said, a collective effort begets massive positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in diverse ways.
But the goal remains the same, and that is to save water and adopt water conservation.
The drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort would rid of the problem of water logging.
The construction of the water-tank in Telangana's Thimmaipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about the collective endeavour in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about those women of Garhwal, who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting.
I believe that many such attempts are being made and we can turn impossible in to possible when we are together and strive with collective resolve.
When people will join hands, water will be conserved.
I tell you, water is philosopher's stone and its mere touch creates and regenerates life
Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water.
In this campaign not only should we focus on water related problems but propagate ways to save water as well.
I specifically urge the luminaries belonging to different walks of life to lead promotion of water conservation through innovative campaigns.
Whether it be from the world of films, sports, our friends in the media, people belonging to social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as Katha - Kirtan, everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion.
We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour.
Youll see, we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you gets an opportunity to go to Porbandar, the place of birth of revered Bapu, then there is a house behind the house of revered Bapu, where a 200-year old water tank still exists.
It is still capable of storing water and has a mechanism to harvest rain water
As I always say that whosoever visits Kirti Mandir, should also pay a visit to that Water Tank.
And there must be many types of such examples of experimentation in water conservation throughout our nation
You can all share your content using the JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag.
My dear countrymen, I must express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing
In any corner of the world, yoga enthusiast welcomes the sun as soon it rises and then there is the complete journey ending with sunset.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective nations.
On that day, the world appeared to be like one big happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive denizens are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures this very principle.
Therefore promotion of Yoga is a great example of social service.
Should we not recognize such service and bestow it with honour
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Minister's Awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award would be bestowed on those organizations around the world, whose significant and unique contributions in the promotion of yoga you cannot even imagine
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and conducts various training courses.
Italy's Ms.
These are inspirational examples in themselves.
If there is a topic related to yoga, then can Indians lag behind others
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured.
Similarly, Swami Rajarsrhi Muni the founder of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University was also honoured.
But yes
I will keep on waiting for your suggestions.
The process of linking with your thoughts through Mann Ki Baat as a medium is a very important and personal journey for myself.
Let us keep on meeting and keep on talking.
Let me keep on listening to your thoughts, let me keep on understanding and cherish them.
Let me sometimes try to live those very emotions.
May your blessings remain there for me
You are my inspiration and you are my energy
Let's sit together and while enjoying Mann Ki Baat try to fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. I begin Mann Ki Baat today with a heavy heart.
These brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred twenty five crore Indians.
In order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully, these brave sons toiled relentlessly, day or night.
on the other, they have retaliated in equal measure, in a language the attackers understand.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished.
The Army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers.
The martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore, through the media, touching, inspiring stories of their kin, which give hope and strength to the entire country.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjan ji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF.
Similar sentiments are coming to the fore in the households of our brave heart martyrs.
I urge the young generation to know and understand the fortitude and the sentiment displayed by these families.
these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising glowing India.
My dear countrymen, the rather long wait after Independence for a War Memorial is about to be over.
It is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty ji of Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness on the completion of the National War Memorial.
India not having a National War Memorial used to surprise me, pain me...
a Memorial that would house the valour saga series of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives, safe guarding their nations security.
And I took a resolve that the country must have such a Memorial.
We decided to erect the National War Memorial and I am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time.
Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Armed Forces.
On part of the nation, this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the nations gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence.
The Memorials design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles, which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being, culminating in his martyrdom.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second circle, Veerta Chakra, depicts the courage and bravery of our soldiers.
This circle stands for the sacrifice of our soldiers.
This bears the names of soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice, in letters of gold.
Following that is the Rakshak Chakra which depicts the spirit of security.
This circle houses a row of dense trees.
In the month of October last year, I was blessed with the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
That too echoed the same sentiment, and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen police women, who relentlessly ensure our safety security.
I do hope that you will pay a visit to the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you are there, do capture images and share them on social media so that others get inspired to come visit this sacred site with eagerness.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting thousands of letters and comments from your side, on various platforms.
Coincidentally, the 3rd of March is also the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata.
He further states that despite both personalities hailing from diverse family backgrounds, they enriched the legacy and the history of Jharkhand.
Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata is, in a way, salutation to the glorious legacy and history of Jharkhand.
These two distinguished personalities brought glory honour not just to Jharkhand, but the entire country.
The country is indeed grateful for their contribution.
Do you know why they had to resort to such a cowardly operation
Because even the British who raised a mighty empire used to be terrified of him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda took on the might of the guns cannons of the British, using traditional bows and arrows, to shake them apart.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda not only waged a struggle against the British for political freedom he also actively fought for the social economic rights of the tribal folk.
And he accomplished all this in his rather short life.
He let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five.
Illustrious sons of Mother India, such as Birsa Munda have come into being in each every part of the country.
There mustve been hardly any part of India, which did not produce someone who contributed in the long freedom struggle, that spanned centuries.
If the valourous Bhagwan Birsa Munda made us aware of our existence identity, far-sighted Jamsetji Tata created great institutions for the country.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry was imperative for her future.
It was his vision that culminated in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, which we know as Indian Institute of Science today.
Not just that, he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as Tata Steel.
On a voyage to America, Jamsetji Tata met Swami Vivekananda on the ship, and an important topic of their discussion was the outreach spread of Science Technology in India.
It is said... this very discussion led to the founding of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on the 29th of February.
All of you know that this day comes just once in four years.
A simple, peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders.
In Independent India, the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by Morarji bhai Desai.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price in his old age.
The government of that time arrested and incarcerated him.
But when the Janata Party won the general elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The 44th amendment, made it mandatory that the proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies were made public through the newspapers.
This amendment, restored certain powers of Supreme Court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abrogated during the Emergency.
For the first time constitutional safeguards guaranteed that the President could only announce the emergency upon the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and that the period of emergency could not be extended more than six months at any stretch of time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of emergency, could never be repeated again in the future.
The upcoming generations of our nation will always remember his priceless contribution in maintaining the sanctity of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
My beloved countrymen, this year too, there was a great buzz about the Padma award.
They, by their diligence, are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways.
He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation.
I had gifted a Rogan painting titled 'Tree of Life' done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
America's Tao Porchon-Lynch will leave you astounded, Lynch has become a living institution of yoga today.
She not only trained the women of the village in pursuing other gainful means of employment, but most importantly she integrated technology with agriculture and my dear countrymen, it has perhaps happened for the first time, that in the roll of Padma awards bestowed this year, 12 farmers have been the recipients.
Generally, very few people associated with the agricultural world or those very few who can be labeled as real farmers have ever found their name in the list of Padmashree awards.
This in itself presents the live and vibrant image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which Ive been wanting to do past few days.
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakh impoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
My dear countrymen, exam time in schools throughout the nation is soon going to dawn upon us.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students whore going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
In this Town Hall programme, I had the opportunity to talk with crores of students from India and abroad, and also with their parents and teachers
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.
Many times while conversing with you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts sent on the phone, I feel that you have adopted me as part of your family.
This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
and shall keep doing Mann Ki Baat with you for years.
Once again, I thank all of you from the core of my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My Dear Countrymen,Namaskar On the 21st of this month, our Country received very sad news.
Dr. Shri Shri Shri ShivaKumar Swamiji of District Tumukur, Karnataka was no more.
ShivaKumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to Social Service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us, Kayakave Kailas meaning discahrging ones duties with due dilligence and persevereance is akin to being in the abode of Lord Shiva ie Kailasha Dham.
ShivaKumar Swamiji was a true follower of this tenet .
during his life spanning a hundred and eleven years, he strived tirelessly towards the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people .
He was renowned to be a masterly scholar of languages such as English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his life in ensuring that food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge reached out to people.
The welfare of farmers was a priority in his life.
The Siddhganga Mutt regularily used to organise cattle and agricultural fairs.
I have had the fortunate opportunity to be blessed by Swamiji, many a time.
On this occasion Kalam Saheb had recited a poem dedicated to revered Swamiji.
Once again, I pay tribute to this great man.
My Dear Countrymen,On the 26th of January, 1950, our Constitution came in to being
our Country was proclaimed a Republic.
Yesterday, we celebrated Republic Day with pride and fervour.
But today I want to speak to you on a totally different aspect.
The 25th of January was the Formation Day of the Election Commission, which is celebrated now as the National Voters Day.
The scale at which elections are held in India is a matter of great awe for the World.
It is natural for every Citizen to feel proud of the Election Commission of its meticulous organising abilities.
in a remote place in Gir forest, there is a polling booth for a sole voter.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for relentlessly striving to ensure the strengthening of our democracy.
I hold in high esteem, the Election Commissions of all states, security personnel and other staff members who contribute in ensuring strict adherence to free and fair polling.
This year, our Country will undergo Lok Sabha elections.
The first time ever, young persons born in the 21st Century will exercise their Right to Vote in the Lok Sabha Elections.
They face the opportunity to shoulder responsibilities pertaining to the Country.
They have embarked upon the journey of being partners in Nation building.
The time has come for a confluence of individual dreams and the Nations dream.
I urge the young generation to register themselves as voters, if they are eligible.
Simultaneously, the sentiment that voting is our sacred duty, should grow within us naturally.
For any reason, if one is not able to vote, it should pain one.
One should be saddened to witness any wrong taking place in the country.
Our country is Bahuratna vasundhara .
One among them was Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.
On the 23rd of January, the country celebrated the birth anniversary of Netaji in an uncommon, special manner.
On this occasion I was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in Indias freedom struggle.
You may be aware of the fact that inside Red Fort, many chambers and structures lay locked unused for several decades after Independence.
Those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums. A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army
Every inch, every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history.
Tales of valour of the heroes of our freedom struggle emanating from every nook corner of these museums inspire us to delve deeper into our history.
Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had to face a trial under British Rule.
I dedicated that cap to the museum itself, for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar islands.
At an event, our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where Netaji Subhash Bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago.
In a similar manner, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, it surprised everyone, since conventionally, this is done on the 15th of August.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Through his clarion calls Dilli Chalo, Tum mujhe Khoon do, main tumhe azadi doonga, Netaji secured a special place in every Indians heart.
That files associated with Netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years.
And I am happy that we could manage to do the same.
I remember the day when Netajis family paid a visit to the Prime Ministers residence.
We dwelt at length on myriad facets of Netaji Subhash Bose, offering him tributes.
It gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of India being developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road, associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar, or the Sardar Patel museum or the Kranti Mandir
Whenever you come to Delhi, you must pay a visit to these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we refer to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you an incident from Netajis life.
In 1942, Subhash Babu established Azad Hind Radio and through it he used to communicate with soldiers of the Indian National Army and other countrymen.
I am told this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto Urdu languages.
In managing the affairs of this radio station, a resident of Gujarat M.
R.
Vyas ji played a vital role.
Programmes broadcast over Azad Hind Radio were very popular amongst the populace.
Their programmes were a major source of inspiration strength to our freedom fighters.
In this very Kranti Mandir, a visual arts museum has been established.
Indias art culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way.
The museum has 4 historical exhibitions which display more than 450 paintings and artworks which are of three centuries vintage.
Exquisite works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
And I also specially request you to visit the place and see for yourself the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you must be thinking that we are discussing art and here Im talking about seeing Gurudev Tagore's excellent works of art.
You have probably known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore till date as a writer and a musician.
He did paintings of many animals and birds, he also painted many landscapes, and not only that he also tried to depict many human characters by etching them on canvas.
And the most unique aspect was that Gurudev Tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works.
He believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality, from his own perspective, understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting.
His paintings have been on display in European countries, in Russia and in America.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds.
One such Saint was - Sant Ravidas.
On 19th February we will observe Ravidas Jayanti.
The couplets or dohas of Sant Ravidas ji are very well-known.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy city of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and the worker throughout his life via his messages.
Our space program has been possible due to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites developed by our students and Sounding Rockets have reached space.
On 24th January 'KALAM SAT' fashioned by our students had been launched.
The Sounding Rockets made by Odisha university students have also created many records.
The number of successful space missions attempted since the country's independence till 2014 have been equal to those successfully completed in the past four years.
We have also created a world record for launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using Space Technology in devices employed in saving assets and life.
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all of these safety measures are being augmented by Space Technology.
Among our fishermen, NAVIC devices are being distributed, which contribute in their economic development as well as ensure their safety.
We are using Space Technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
"Housing for all" or the "House for everyone" scheme involves geo-tagging of about 40 lakh homes spread over 23 states.
Along with this scheme, about thirty and a half million properties under MNREGA have also been tagged.
Today our satellites are a symbol of the country's growing might.
Through its highly competitive launch services, India today not only propels satellites of developing countries but also those of developed nations.
The sky and stars have always enthralled children.
Our Space Program provides an impetus to the children to think big and reach across those boundaries, which were considered impossible till today.
It is a vision to inspire the children to discover new stars, while gazing at them
In January about 6,000 players participated in 18 disciplines in the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune.
This time in 'Khelo India', participants from every state have performed well at their individual level.
The life of many a medal winner is also immensely inspiring.
I was reading that young Akash Gorkha who won a silver medal in boxing had his father, Ramesh Ji working as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
They live in a parking shed with their family.
The captain of Maharashtra Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team, Sonali Helvi is from Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged the talent and skills of Sonali.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged much to participate in sports such as Kabaddi.
In spite of the hurdles, Sonali not only chose Kabaddi but excelled in this discipline.
10-year-old Abhinav Shaw hailing from Asansol is the youngest gold medallist in the Khelo India Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshaya Basavani Kamat, from Karnataka won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we talk about the creation of a New India, then determination exhibited by our youth is the veritable example of what is New India
These inspiring stories from the annals of Khelo India, are ample proof , that the building of New India does not only involve contribution from the denizens of big cities but also from the youth, children, young sports talents, hailing from small cities, towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many a prestigious beauty contest.
But have you heard about the Shining Toilet contest
Over the past month, more than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique contest.
I appeal to all the Sarpanchs and village heads to take a lead in this campaign in their respective Panchayats.
And do share your "clean beautiful toilet" photos with me on MylzzatGhar on social media.
Friends together, on October 2, 2014, we had embarked on a memorable journey together to clean our country and to get rid of open defecation.
My younger friends, the days of examinations are approaching .
Anshul Sharma, resident of Himachal Pradesh has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and Exam Warriors.
Anshul ji, I thank you for raising this issue.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is Exam Season.
I would have liked to discuss this topic at length in Mann Ki Baat of today, but you will be happy to know that just after a gap of two days ,on January 29, at 11 am, in the 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I am going to interact with students from all over the country, and this time, along with the students, their parents and teachers are also going to be part of this program.
And this time, students from other countries will also participate.
In this 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I will touch upon a lot of things related to all the facets of examinations with my young friends, especially on the topic of stress free exams.
Some of these ideas and suggestions I will definitely put in front of you during the Town Hall program.
You must also try to become a part of this program .
and through social media and Namo App, you can also see its live telecast.
My dear countrymen 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11am the whole country pays homage to the martyrs.
Wherever we are, we must pay two minutes tribute to our martyrs.
Remember our revered Bapu and take a vow to fulfill the dreams of Pujya Bapu, to build a new India, and to fulfill our duties as a citizen let us move forward with this resolution.
Let us ensure this journey of 2019 remains successful.
Many many felicitations and thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
My Dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The year 2018 is about to conclude.
We shall soon enter 2019.
it is equally so, to hear about resolutions for the year being ushered in.
Whether it be the life of an individual, the life of a society at large or the life of a Nation collectively, everybody has to look back ponder
Only then can the gains of experience be availed of, only then can ones self-confidence renew further.
What exactly should we do in order to ensure a change in our lives, simultaneously contributing our bit in taking our country society forward
Many good wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
On account of the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, swachchata, sanitation coverage is rapidly advancing towards crossing the 95 mark.
After Independence, for the first time ever, the tricolor was hoisted at Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
The highest United Nations Environment Award Champions of the Earth was conferred upon India.
The world duly took notice of Indias efforts in the areas of Solar Energy Climate Change.
The first General Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held in India.
It is due to our collective efforts that our country has seen unprecedented improvement in the Ease of doing business rankings.
Daughters of the country have done her proud by circumnavigating the globe through the NavikaSagarParikrama.
Indias first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi.
This has laid the foundation of a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The longest rail-road bridge, Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the Nation- Sikkims first Indias hundredth airport, Pakyong commenced operations.
India scripted a thumping win in the under- 19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India clinched a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India also performed very well in the Para Asian Games too.
By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry
And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
I sincerely hope that Indias journey on the path of advancement progress continues through 2019 too. Taking her to newer heights with her inner strengths.
My dear countrymen, this December we had to bear the loss of some extraordinary, exemplary countrymen.
Jayachandran was known for his efforts of making the most economical treatment possible available to the poor.
On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka.
SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth.
In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services.
There are many exemplary personalities such as Dr.
Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society.
Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged.
Every month, the Heart Lungs Critical Centre there organizes such camps, where free diagnosis and treatment for a host of ailments is done.
Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps.
The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise.
Today, Im saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the Swachch Bharat Mission a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.
In this Mahayagya, grand undertaking, the Municipal Corporation, voluntary bodies, School- College students, the people of Jabalpur in fact everyone participated with enthusiasm est.
I just referred to the betterindia.
Whenever I get the opportunity, I visit the better India website and try to know more about such shining, inspiring deeds.
I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems.
com is doing great work in spreading positivity and infusing more sensitivity into society.
Similarly, success stories of young innovators entrepreneurs are women beautifully on yourstory.
Lets come together to make positivity viral.
I do believe that by doing so more and more people will get to know about our heroes who brought a change in society.
Spreading negativity is fairly easy.
But some really good work is being done around us, in our society. And all this has been possible through the collective efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanaya trained hard in Karate with perseverance fervor, studied its nuances and proved herself.
On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future.
Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani.
You too must have read it.
Rajani has won a gold medal at the Junior Womens Boxing Championship.
The moment Rajani won the medal she rushed to a nearby milk stall drank a glass of milk.
After that, she wrapped a cloth around the medal kept it in a bag.
You must be wondering why Rajani did that
She did it in honour of her father Jasmer Singh ji who sells lassi, at a stall in Panipat.
According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is.
Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up.
When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could.
Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially.
Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart went ahead with her training in boxing.
She has won a medal in Serbia too.
This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle.
She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day.
Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable.
Dont news of such achievements, such accomplishments inspire us
Best wishes to our food providers, the farming brothers and sisters.
Our festivals are replete with fragrance of the essence of Unity in Diversity and the spirit of One India Great India.
In Indian culture society and nature are indistinguishable, in our culture the person and his environment are considered in totality.
A great example of the interconnection between us and Nature is the calendar based on our festivals.
It comprises festivals all around the year as well as the movements of the celestial bodies.
It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow.
In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals.
GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.
The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals.
Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds.
Millions of people take a dip in the holy rivers on theoccasion of MakarSankranti.
Our festivals, impart to us many social values.
On the one hand, where they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival quite easily in itself teaches the important lesson of life - the value of staying together, imbued with a feeling of brotherhood.
I wish all of you a great year 2019 and do hope that you all to enjoy the oncoming festive season.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage.
This time the world famous Kumbh Mela is going to be held in Prayagraj from January 15, and many of you might be waiting eagerly for it to take place.
The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started.
It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh.
The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh.
The festival of Kumbh, to be organized in Prayagraj, is expected to have footfalls from more than 150 countries
This can be a huge learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were progressing on a war footing.
This time much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh.
If during the course of this event sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide.
This time every devotee will be able to have a darshan of the pious Akshayavat after the holy dip in the confluence.
This great symbol of peoples faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of.
Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone.
I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith also become Mahakumbh of ofnationalism.
May this Kumbh of aesthetics also become the Mahakumbh of creativity.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity regardingthe celebration of RepublicDay on 26th January, when we remember those great men who gave us our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
We are fortunate that South African President Mr.
Cyril Ramaphosa is going to grace the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.
Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the 'Mahatma'.
It was in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood rock steady in protest of apartheid.
He also founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the demand for peace and justice echoed to the whole world.
He derivedinspiration and endurancefor spending many years in jail from Bapu himself.
Mandela said this about Bapu - "Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because it was here that he used his first experiment with truth
It was here, he developed the philosophy of his satyagraha and his methods of struggle.
"Mandela used to consider Bapu as his role model.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only sources of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals have always encouraged us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held at Kevdia on the banks of Narbada in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue 'Statue of Unity' is situated, there I had a meaningful discussion with the top policemen of the country.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country.
He always remained engaged in keeping India's integrity intact.
SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land.
It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel's aspirations through this award for National Integration.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the date ofthe sacred festival observed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his work was centred in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded.
In a way, entire India received his blessings.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru TeghBahadurji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the hallowed position of the Guru at a tender ageof nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited courage to fight for justice from the legacy of Sikh Gurus.
He was bestowed with a quiet and simple personality, but whenever, an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, or injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said -"I can make one fight against one hundred and fifteen thousands,I can make the sparrow fight against the hawkThat be the reason that Gobindsingh be my name.
He was a divine figure full of heroism, valor, courage, sacrifice and devotion.
He had beatific knowledge of both weapons andShaastras.
He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages.
I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good events happening in the country, which are not widely discussed.
Under the aegis of "Eat Right India" campaign, Swasth Bharat trips are being carried out across the country.
These campaigns will last till Jan 27th.
I has been working beyond this brief for public awareness and public education.
A clean and healthy India will spell a prosperous India also.
Nutritious food is most essential for good health.
In this context, I extend hearty greetings to F.
The education regarding importance of food is essential right from childhood.
Come, imbued with renewed inspiration, renewed zeal, renewed resolution, new accomplishments, loftier goals lets move on, keep moving, change oneself and change the country too.
Anshu Kumar Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna on similar lines Monica Jain from Delhi, Prosenjit Sarkar from Bardhaman, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur converge in asking a shared question.
They are of the view that broadly speaking, their Prime Minister being associated with the latest in technology, Social Media and Mobile Apps
Let me quote an incident.
The year was 1998.
I was then a party worker with the Bharatiya Janata Party organization in Himachal.
It was the month of May
It was a tiny joint
I dont get it
Said he Sir, just listen to the radio.
Recently, All India Radio got a survey done on Mann Ki Baat.
I came across some feedback that is very interesting.
Out of the designated sample in the survey, 70 of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people believe that the greatest contribution of Mann Ki Baat has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society.
The medium of Mann Ki Baat has promoted many a mass revolution.
indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion.
I am overjoyed on account of the fact that through Mann Ki Baat, radio is rising as a popular medium, more than ever before.
The fact is, if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions, what else does he need
One of their findings was that, this programme has remained apolitical.
When Mann Ki Baat commenced, I had firmly decided that it would carry nothing political, or any praise for the Government, nor Modi for that matter anywhere.
in fact my highest inspiration, have been YOU.
These minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive.
This new inspiration zest will keep taking her to greater heights.
I read a letter then try to weave it with the essence of a similar letter.
I would like to share a couple of personal experiences with you ...
Who would have imagined that a small campaign selfie with daughter starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well.
Every section of the society including celebrities joined in to ignite a process of transformation in a new modern language of change that the present generation understands and follows.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the Government it is about the society.
Mann Ki Baat addresses an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
Politics or Political Power are not intrinsic to the Indian ethos
on the contrary social values and society are.
In fact, Politics is one of the numerous other aspects of social life.
Making politics an all pervasive, powerful factor is not an effective way for a healthy society.
At times, political developments and political people assume such overriding prominence that other talents and courageous deeds get overshadowed.
Many thanks for your phone call.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time before Mann Ki Baat, letters are received from people
My effort is that I read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before Mann Ki Baat.
I listen to many phone calls too.
And as the episode of Mann Ki Baat draws closer, I read ideas and inputs sent by you very minutely while travelling.
My countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writers situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process.
That letter does not remain a mere a piece of paper for me.
As it is I have spent close to 40 to 45 years as a travelling mendicant and have been to most of the districts in our country including the remotest once where I spent a lot of time.
An effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which, somehow, could not be included in Mann Ki Baat.
I also thank my colleagues from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV Channels and the Social Media.
It is due to their hard work that Mann Ki Baat reaches maximum number of people.
The team from All India Radio prepares each episode for broadcast in a number of regional languages.
Some of them very aptly narrate in a voice and style resembling that of Modis.
In this way for those 30 minutes they become Narendra Modi.
I congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills.
I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well.
I sincerely thank from the core of my heart my friends in the media who regularly telecast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political person is ever happy with the media, he feels that he is getting a very little coverage or the coverage given to him is negative.
Without your contribution and cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
What I am doing must be happening in families as well.
There are old baggages of our own lives and when they do not come in the way, it becomes easier to understand others.
None of the two even realizes that how and when one others has abandoned its idea and accepted and owned the idea of the other side.
Todays youths have this special quality that they wont do anything which they do not believe themselves and whenever they believe in something, they follow that leaving everything else.
People generally talk of a communication gap between the elders and teenagers in the family.
In fact, the scope of discussion with teenagers is quite limited in most of the families.
Most of the time these talks remain limited to studies, habits or life style and the dos and donts.
My effort is to have a continuous dialogue with the youth in various programmes or through social media.
I try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking.
They are storehouse of ideas.
They are extremely energetic, innovative and focused.
I try to share the efforts and achievements of the youth as much as possible through Mann Ki Baat.
There is a general complaint that the younger generation asks too many questions.
I say it is good that the youth ask questions.
We feel that the youths are very ambitious today and they plan big.
I feel it is good, dream big and achieve bigger successes after all, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time.
I say what is wrong in it.
They do so because they are adept in multitasking.
If we just look around, we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way, may it be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other field.
Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big.
If we put these ideas of our youth into practice and provide them conducive environment to express themselves, they surely will bring about a constructive and a positive change in the country- they are already doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the Constitution Day which falls on the 26th November.
She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption.
Thank you very much for your suggestion Vineeta ji.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to accomplish this stupendous task of drafting the Constitution.
Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years.
The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today.
This also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country, each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution to the country which empowers the people of India and enriches even the poorest of the poor.
I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant.
This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, we shall complete 70 years as a Republic and in 2022, we shall enter 75th year of our Independence.
Let us all take forward the values enshrined in our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
He also used to say that we, Indians may be from different background but, yes, we shall have to keep the national interest above all the other things.
India First was the basic doctrine of Dr.
All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well.
Besides, a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
This Gurudwara suffered severe damage due to the devastating earth quake of 2001 in Gujarat.
But our journey shall continue.
The more you connect with us, our journey will gain greater depth, providing, satisfaction to one and all.
At times a question arises in the minds of peoples as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat.
your ambitions are my ambitions.
Come on, let us take this journey further.
The 31st of October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year too, the youth of the country is all set, to take part in the Run for Unity.
The weather too these days is pleasant.
I urge you to participate in the largest possible numbers in this run for unity.
Six months or so before Independence, on the 27th of January, 1947, the world famous international Magazine Time had a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of that edition.
In their lead story, they had depicted a map of India
It was the map of an India that was divided into myriad fragments.
There existed over 550 princely states.
The English had lost interest in India
the manner in which he had managed relief operations during the Ahmedabad floods in the 1920s
the way he steered the Bardoli Satyagrah.
Such was his sense of honesty commitment that the farmer, the worker right up to the industrialist trusted him with full faith.
The 31st of October this year will be special on one more account- on this day, we shall dedicate the statue of unity of the nation as a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.
This is the worlds tallest scyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud to see the worlds tallest statue here on Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too.
My dear brothers sisters, we celebrated Infantry Day yesterday.
I respectfully bow before all of them who are part of the Indian Armed Forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
But, do you know why we Indian citizens commemorate this day as Infantry Day
This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression.
This incident too is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the celebrated Army officer sam Manekshaw.
In that interview, field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was reminiscing on times when he was a Colonel.
Around this time, military operations commenced in Kashmir.
The 31st of October also is the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt love sports
Elements like spirit, strength, skill, stamina are extremely important in the world of sports.
They are the ultimate test for a sportspersons mettle...
Just recently I had two memorable meetings.
First, I got an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held at Jakarta.
Similarly, I was blessed with a chance to meet our winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be pleased to know that in the Summer Youth Olympics 2018, the performance of our youth was the best ever.
At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events.
This is the real story of Indian Sports which are witnessing an upswing with each passing day.
India is setting new records not just in the field of sports but also in hitherto uncharted areas.
When he turned eight he lost his father.
Then he spent another eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries.
The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events.
Not just that, just observe the rapidly enhancing levels of excellence in Indian sports
Hitherto, India had never won a medal in a Judo event, at the junior or senior level.
But Tabaabi Devi created history by bagging the silver medal at the youth Olympics.
16 year old player Tabaabi Devi hails from a village in Manipur.
Her father is a labourer and mother a fish-seller.
There were times when the family had no money to buy food.
Even such hardships were not able to cow down her zest devotion.
And she has created history by winning a medal for the country.
Stories like these are innumerable.
Every life, every being is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportspersons passion dedication is the hallmark of New India.
My dear countrymen, you may recall that we had successfully organized FIFA Under- 17 World Cup in the year 2017.
The whole world acclaimed this as a very successful tournament.
This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December.
Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey.
India has produced many great hockey players.
Whenever there will be reference to Hockey,the story will remain incomplete without a mention of these legends.
Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world.
Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey.
Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention.
It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches.
Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there.
But, in this new era, the new generation is coming forward in a new way with a fresh vigour and spirit to fulfill their new dream.
Someone is teaching the old people someone is involved in the campaign of cleanliness whereas someone is helping out the farmers.
And there is no vested interest behind all these activities but a pure feeling of dedication and resolve is the driving force.
One young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled, divyang players.
This spirit, this dedication is a mission mode activity.
Will this not make every Indian feel proud.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry.
He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic in Mann Ki Baat as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature.
How do we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for achieving sustainable development and learn from those traditions
Manishji, I appreciate you for bringing this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one subject that inspires us to look into our dignified past and our ancient traditions, Today, the whole world and specially the western countries are discussing about environment protection and are trying to find new ways to adopt a balanced life style.
Our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of Central India and specially those in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship Peepal and Arjun trees religiously.
The Bishnoi community in the desert land of Rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection.
Specially, in the context of serving trees, they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree.
Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh claim their relationship with tigers.
They even treat them like their brothers and sisters.
People of Warli Community in Maharashtra consider tigers as their guests and for them the presence of tigers is a good omen indicating prosperity.
The Gond tribes in Central Indai stop fishing in some parts of Kaithan river during the breeding season.
They consider this area as a fish reserve and they get plentiful of healthy fishes because of this belief of theirs.
In the isolated regions of the Nilgiri plateau in South India, a small wanderer community Toda make their settlements using locally available material only.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights.
There is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities.
Come on, let us express our gratitude towards them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra-ordinary contribution for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about a farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab.
The son of this hard working farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was to be married.
But, you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he told the brides father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji asked him to promise that they will not burn parali or stubble in their fields.
You can well imagine the social strength this statement had.
This point made by Gurbachan Singh ji appears quite ordinary but this reveals how tall and strong his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who connect their individual matters with the benefit of the society as a whole.
Shriman Gurbachan Singh jis family has presented one such example before us.
I have also read about a village Kallar Majra which is near Nabha in Punjab.
Kallar Majra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process.
Congratulations to bhai Gurbachan Singh ji
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor.
My dear countrymen, it has been told in our epics:- : , , : : : It means- O, Lord, peace should prevail all around in all three Lokas,in water, in air, in space, in fire, in wind, in medicines, in vegetation, in gardens, in sub conscious, in the whole creation.
Grant peace to each soul, each heart, in me, in you, in every particle and everywhere in the Universe.
For India, World War I was an important event.
Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war.
Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war.
The world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during the World War I
According to estimates, around one crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives.
This made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace does not only mean no war.
There is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism, climate change, economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co-ordination.
Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-East has a unique distinction of its own.
The natural beauty of North East has no parallel and the people of this area are extremely talented.
Now our North-east is also known for all best deeds.
North east is one region that has made grand progress in organic farming.
A few days ago Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award, 2018 for encouraging the sustainable food system.
This award is given by the UN body Food Agriculture Organisation FAO.
You will be delighted to know that this best policy making award is equivalent to an Oscar in the sector.
Not only this, our Sikkim outperformed 51 nominated policies of 25 countries to win this award.
For this, I heartily compliment the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
uite a change is being felt in the weather.
Winter has set in and with the changing weather, the season of festivals has also set in - Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaiya Dooj, Chhatth in a way it can be said that the month of November is the month of festivals.
Your progress is a vital part of the countrys progress.
