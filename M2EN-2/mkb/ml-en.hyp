Mann Ki Baat 2019
My dear countrymen, greet you.
Today is Diwali's holy day.
Deepawali is now being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The unique feature of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country are celebrating Diwali with great joy and joy.
This is where a microcosm of India is being displayed.
Friends, tourism related to festivals in the world has a unique attraction for festival tourism.
In our country, every region has its own diversity festivals and people of other countries are particularly interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different for this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat.
I had said, "Come together, let us celebrate the women power and achievements of India this time, that is, we will respect the Laxmi of India.
Look, shortly enough stories of inspiring stories appeared in the social media.
My mother is my strength by writing the Kodipaka play in Warangal on Namo App.
My mother took over the responsibility of five children when my father died in 1990.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
My blessings to your mother.
Maj Kushboo Kanwar, who headed the Assam Rifles 'Assam Rifles', says Gatika Swami, who is an actor in the film, is the daughter of the bus conductor.
For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter Bharatlaxmi and her own strength.
She is proud that her daughter is a great painter.
The daughter got a good rank in the CAT exam.
On the other hand, Megha Jain has been writing about an old 92-year-old man who has been distributing free drinking water at Gualior Railway Station for years.
Meghaji, the humility and compassion of this Bharat Lakshmi is a source of inspiration.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inculcate motivation... and share the things you have...
The emotions of that poem, the words of that poem, have been written about the things we say in the 17th century.
How great words, how great a genius, how good a thought is in this poem of Kannada language
The Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Himalayan Mountain has been famous because of his daughter Laxmi, the King of the Himalayas has been famous because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
It is because of the glory of these women that our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can never forget that I went to Gurudwara in Vancouver and Tehran.
I have many things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev who can share with you but it will require several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm against many evils like that.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji brought his message to the world far and wide.
He was the most traveling man at that time.
Going to many places, everybody's mind was filled with his simplicity and humility and behavior like ordinary people.
The great religious journey of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is called Udasi.
With the message of harmony and equality, he went north, south, east, west and faced the people, sages and sages everywhere.
Sant Shankar Dev, the well-known saint of Assam, is also believed to have inspired him.
Rajgir and Gaya related to Buddhism also went to the holy places.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
On the journey to Beedar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bihar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During a journey like this, Guru Nanak ji had travelled in Kashmir and surroundings of North India.
This has established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji had also visited Tibet and the people of that place considered him a Guru.
He is also venerable in Uzbekistan.
As part of his visit, he has also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took a place in the minds of millions of people, and they followed his advice with due respect, even today.
A few days ago, diplomatic delegates from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
They visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar where Guru Nanak Devji was the 550th birth anniversary.
The diplomatic delegates visited the Golden Temple and had the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After that, many Ambassadors shared the pictures in the social media and wrote about the good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you will remember October 31.
At that time, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India, was born on the threshold of unity in this country.
Sardar Patel had the surprising ability to unite the people, and was also emotionally united with those with discretion.
Sardar Patel had depthly watched and studied every small thing.
In true sense, he was a person of analysis.
He also excelled in organizational capacity.
He gained expertise in planning and war strategy.
While reading and listening about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, we can see how deep his preparedness was.
In 1921, thousands of people from all over the country came to participate in the Congress General Meeting in Ahmedabad.
He was responsible for all arrangements related to the Mahasammelan.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's water supply system.
Make sure nobody has a problem with water.
He contacted the farmers and asked them to make Khadi bags.
Farmers made bags and sold them to the representatives.
The delegates didn't want to steal shoes because they kept shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He did a great deal of ensuring fundamental rights, so that there was no possibility of any kind of difference in the caste system.
Friends, we know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the romantic effort of uniting the nation and the history of the country has been fulfilled.
Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty was to pay attention to everything.
When India was partitioned in 1947, our neighbour's eyes fell on the island of Lakshadweep and they shipped it with the flag of that country.
With no attention to this, Sardar Patel immediately took a tough step without wasting time.
He directed the brothers of Arcot Ramswamy Bohiar and Arcot Laxmanaswamy to take the people from Tirthankar to Lakshadweep and to raise the triangular flag on Lakshadweep and to fly the triangular flag on Lakshadweep.
Soon there was a triangular flag fluttering and the land was devastated by the neighbour's dream of capturing Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel instructed the brothers and sisters of Lakshadweep to ensure that all necessary assistance is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist spot.
I hope you all will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, I had dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in America is twice as high.
The tallest statue in the world makes every Indian proud.
The heads of all Indians are rising with pride.
You would be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists visiting the Statue of Unity within a year.
The people there are now beginning to cultivate dragon fruits and I am sure it will become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
We are witness to the development of a place as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There people from all over the country and abroad.
Travelling facilities, habitations, guides, environment friendly arrangements are being developed on their own.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, In the past, Time Magazine is an Indian who is not proud to have given the Statue of Unity a great place among the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you all take some time from your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity.
However, my request to all Indians who have taken time to travel should go to at least 15 tourist destinations and stay at night.
Friends, as you know, every year since 2014, on 31st October, we celebrate political unity day.
On this day, we send a message to all of us to save our country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity is also being organized every time.
It will be attended by people from all walks of life, from all walks of life.
It is a symbol of the fact that this country is one of the Run for Unity, which goes in one direction and wishes to achieve the same goal.
Similarly, in recent times, there is a special interest and zeal in the cause of Marathon.
The Railway Phone Unit is also a beautiful opportunity for it.
Running is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
Therefore, not only for the body, but also for the unity of the mind and the cultural India, and for bringing India to new heights...
So if you live in any city, you can find out where the Run for Unity is going.
I hope you all will run for Indias unity and your fitness on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has laid the foundation of unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around ourselves, we can see several examples of continuing efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
However, sometimes the problems of the society, its contributions, and its rapid disappearance from the memory.
Several types of guys went to the ground.
All types of parties were playing games to make their own profits from the environment.
What kind of language did you speak to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to provide flexibility to different voices.
We remember the irresponsible things that some speakers and some narrators have said to themselves to be glorified.
Appreciating the exaltation of the court with pride, he did not allow anywhere to create an atmosphere of warmth and pressure.
These things have to be remembered forever, which gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
It was a major blow to the country.
I pay my homage to the glory today.
My dear countrymen, if you hear a story of a house far away, if you can hear a story from every village, from north to south, from east to west, if you hear a story from every corner of India then it is about cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village is inspired to have a comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort for cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
125 crore Indians are the heirs of its outcome.
But it's a comfortable, attractive absurd.
I'd like to hear you again.
The world's highest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degrees mines.
There's only a place called oxygen in the air.
In such a negative situation, it is a great adventure to live in the midst of such challenges.
In such a opposite environment, our brave soldiers are not only waiting for our borders but also performing a programme called Swachh Siachen.
We know these Siachen glaciers are the source of rivers and water.
Therefore, taking a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water to those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is an opportunity to awaken the spirit of all of us.
Deepawali, especially buying something new, bringing something from the market, is going on at a very low rate in the family.
I once told you to try to buy local items.
If we get the things we need in our village, we don't have to go to Taluk.
If you get to Taluk, you don't have to go to the district.
Whatever we try to buy local goods, Gandhi will become a great opportunity for 150 himself.
We have to buy something that our khadi girders shaped with the hands of our girdlemen.
I urge you to buy local items with the best wishes of Diwali.
Look, we can see how important we can play to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes there's a fire.
There may be burns.
I appeal to all of you to regulate yourself and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Man Ki Baat, September 2018
There will be no Indian who does not feel proud of the soldiers of our armed forces.
Every Indian, whether in any region or in any caste or language, will always be enthusiastic to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, a hundred and fifty crore people of India celebrated the day of our army's valour with pride.
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers responded to the arrogance of our nation on the basis of terrorism.
Our Armed Forces Exhibitions were organized in different parts of the country with the hope that more and more citizens of the country, especially younger generation, should know what our strengths are.
We want to know how capable we are and how our soldiers are saving their lives and saving the lives of the people.
Days like Parakram Parv reminds youngsters about the proud legacy of our armed forces.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the nation.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our army is sure to respond to those who try to discard the atmosphere of peace in our country.
India is always committed and committed to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace in the two world wars.
Remember that we had nothing to do with that war.
It was an attack by our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest armed forces in the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played a crucial role in ensuring peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
On October 8, we are celebrating Air Force Day.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served for the nation.
When the attackers from Pakistan launched an unexpected attack in 1947, it was the air force that ensured that Indian soldiers and combat equipment reached the battlefield on time to rescue Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Nobody knows about the 1971 Bangladesh Freedom Fight.
The role of the Air Force is sustainable in liberating Kargil from the grip of the invaders in 1999.
At Tiger Hill, the enemy's bases were bombarded by night and the air force dumped them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the commendable work done by our Air Force personnel, whether it is an accidental rescue or an accidental rescue mission.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Army, the Armed Forces contributes not only to men power but also to women power.
I was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he had been on his way to the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but he had been threatened by the terrible ocean.
But this hero of the Indian Navy has been fighting for decades in the ocean.
He lived in the middle of the ocean without eating and drinking.
Failure for life is not ready.
I spoke on telephone when I saved Abhilash from the ocean, a wonderful example of courage, determination and bravery.
His courage, courage, determination, determination and the power to fight evil and succeed will certainly inspire the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
On 2nd October this year, we have a special significance.
For two years from now, we are going to organize various events across the world on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary.
Mahatma Gandhis thoughts have inspired the whole world.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1945, he re-thinked the thoughts and prepared a new version.
His thoughts have been placed in front of the people about the rights of venerable Bapu farmers, villages and workers, and on many issues such as cleanliness and education.
This is called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a mass organiser.
It was his characteristics to join people and mobilize them, this was his nature.
This has been a unique feature of his personality.
He convinced every individual that he is the greatest and most important person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle was to make it a mass movement.
As per the call of Mahatma Gandhi on the freedom struggle, people from all walks of life, from all walks of life have dedicated themselves.
Gandhiji says, I am giving you a mantra.
You don't have any doubts, and you'll feel that you're without pride.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is even greater today.
Today, we have to think about one thing on the basis of the growing middle class in the country, their growing economic strength and growing cruelty.
Can you remember the revered Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something
Can you remember the spell of the virtuous father
Can you imagine what kind of citizen of the country will be benefited by the things I buy
Whose face will be happy
Who will be directly or indirectly benefited by your purchase
I would be more happy if the poor benefit the poor.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji, I am confident that a small step of yours will make a big difference in the life of the poorest and the weakest.
My dear countrymen, perhaps he didn't even know how Gandhiji said that if he cleaned the surroundings he would get freedom.
But that happened, India got freedom.
And how can we feel that by doing small things, our country can contribute to economic growth, economic empowerment and poverty
But I believe that if I can do that, that would be the true patriotism of today's era.
Lal Bahadur scientific Khadi's old and ripe clothes are said to have been kept careful because somebody's teaching is hidden in it.
He used to say that these Khadi clothings are very sophisticated and each of these pinnacles should be utilized.
This feeling of love for the country and the people of the country was filled with a small and lengthy glory.
In a couple of days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientific as well as Pooja Bapu.
As soon as the name of Scientist comes, the Indians will have a lot of respect in their hearts.
His gentle personality is a matter of pride for the people.
Besides, he might have been extremely humble, but he had a strong personality like a mountain in his heart, the specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
His vision of 'Jawan Jai Kisan' is a reflection of his unique personality.
As a reflection of his selfless penance for the nation, he gave the mantra to the jawans and farmers of the country to reach the peak of victory in a short span of about one and a half years.
All over the country, people from all walks of life are associated with the fifteenth fireworks.
If you didn't make a phone call on this subject, people associated with cleanliness wouldn't have noticed such a heart-wrenching thing.
I would like to thank you for phone calls.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 at the beginning of the centenary celebrations of his father.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: 'Swarajya yaat'.
In the Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
In his vision, on October 12, 1993, the National Commission for Human Rights (NHRC) was constituted by the National Commission for Human Rights (NHRC).
Beyond a few days, the Commission is completing 25 years of its existence.
The Human Rights Commission not only preserved human rights, but also enhanced human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that humanity is not an extraordinary imagination.
In this 25-year journey, the Institute has created an ideal and trustworthy atmosphere among the people.
I think this is a very dangerous event for the best democratic values for a healthy society.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 States with national level human rights activities.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring it into action, this is the basis of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVishwas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, Sabka
My dear countrymen, can we not remember the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan in October while the birth anniversary of Rajmata Vijayraje Sindhya begins
These great personalities are very inspiring for us, and we salute them.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb will be discussed in detail in the next Manki Baat, but for a few years, on 31st October, the 'Run for Unity' competition has been held in every small and big city of Hindustan, in villages, in the streets, in the name of 'Run for Unity'.
This year, we have to organize Run For Units in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
On 31st October, through the 'Run for Unity' programme, we have to emphasize our efforts to bring all the elements of the country together within all sections of the society.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, Raksha Bandhan is being celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the people on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan is considered a symbol of mutual affection and trust of sisters and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories that have brought the people of two different countries and religions to the threshold of faith.
Within a few days, the festival of Janmashtami has been going on.
Greetings to all people, to all those who have been dedicated to the nation.
Friends, Sanskrit is celebrated everyday on the occasion of Shravana Purnima without Rakshabandhan.
I congratulate all those who have been associated with this great legacy and bringing it to the common man.
We are very proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and since the Vedic times, Sanskrit has played a very important role in the propagation of knowledge.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking cultural languages.
So, in any minute, it can describe subtle emotions or subjects.
It is also easy to understand because it is related to our soil and our heritage.
For instance, to showcase the importance of the guru in life - Ekamapi Shaktmasthya Guruh, the philosopher, Nasti Tada-liquid, Yad-Datwahi Nrini Bhavet.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day throughout the country.
I convey my best wishes to all teachers of the country on the Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the season comes with new hopes for our hardworking farmers.
Rain brings comfort to trees, trees and dry reservoirs in scorching heat.
But sometimes a terrible and devastating flood comes along.
Nature is reaching a point where it is raining more than at one place.
We have seen that the terrible floods in Kerala have severely affected the lives of people.
Today, in this difficult situation, the entire country is with Kerala.
We have sympathy with those who lost their own.
Even if the lives of the poor cannot be solved, the 1. 25 billion Indians want to assure the distressed families that they stand shoulder to shoulder in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural disaster recover quickly.
I am sure that Kerala will rise due to the enthusiasm and courage of the people.
The damage caused by accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see a lot of visions of humanity in times of danger.
Wherever there is an accident, whether it is in Kerala or in any other state of Hindustan or in district or region, everyone from Kachh to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something in their own way to normalise the lives of the people.
Every age group and every worker is playing their part.
Everyone is ensuring that the sufferings of the people of Kerala are eased and shared their grief.
We know that the Armed Forces personnel are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the people of the flood.
My dear countrymen, this time we were examining the suggestions received by Mann Ki Baat.
The subject written by more and more people from all over the country was the favorite of all of us, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Gaziabad, Swati from Sonip, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akshish Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and several others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov urging everyone to tell about the different pictures of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, when the country and the world heard of Atal ji's death, they were sad.
The Prime Minister assumed office 14 years ago.
In a way, he has been away from active politics for the past 10 years.
It wasn't a place in the news, it wasn't in public life.
The 10-year gap is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world saw that the ten-year period in the minds of the common man of India did not make a minute difference.
Whatever kind of love and respect he had with Atal ji, however sad he spread all over the country, it shows his immense personality.
India will remain indebted to Atalji in the name of the 9th First Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This change has made two major changes in Indian politics.
Firstly, the size of the Cabinets in the States has been fixed at 15 per cent of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limits set by the Contravention Act have been reduced to one-third and two.
At the same time, clear guidelines have been set to disqualify those who are changing the party.
Over the years, a political culture has emerged that has created a large cabinet in India and the formation of big cabinets was not to divide the departments, but to please the political leaders.
Atal ji changed it.
His move was awaiting money and resources.
And efficiency.
This transformation has led to a vision of a person like Atal ji and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atalji was a very patriot.
During his reign, there was a change in the time when the budget was presented.
Earlier, the budget was presented at 5 pm, following the traditions of the British, because it was time for the Parliament to start in England.
In 2001, Atal ji moved from 5 PM to 11 PM on the occasion of the presentation of the budget.
One more freedom - the Indian Flag Code was created during the reign of Atal ji and it was authorized in 2002.
Departments joined the National Flag in public domains.
It is a good thing and good for democracy.
It will be a great tribute to Atal ji for a healthy democracy, for a good democracy, for promoting good habits, constantly striving to strengthen democracy and taking forward the discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I pay tributes to Atalji for all.
A few days ago, the monsoon session of the Parliament ended.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 percent and 74 percent of the Rajya Sabha.
The Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and 14 Bills in Rajya Sabha as a result of all the Members, beyond the partys interest, tried to make the year-long session more effective.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered as a session of social justice and well-being for the youth.
Greater Bills that benefit the youth and the backward communities were passed in this session.
For decades, there was a need to constitute a OBC Commission like the Scheduled Tribes Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has successfully decided to constitute the OBC Commission this time and gave it constitutional authority.
This step will become a goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill was also passed in this session to seek the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will provide more protection to the well-being of Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent criminals from committing aggression, and it will fill up confidence among the groups.
No society of injustice and culture can bear against women power in the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the perpetrators of rape.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and ensured strict punishment.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh had pronounced the execution of an unemployed child for two months immediately.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The court of Rajasthan also took such a decision very quickly.
The Act will play a vital role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
I would like to assure the Muslim women that the entire country stands very strong to bring justice to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the focus of crores of people is now on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first won medals in newspapers, television, news, on social media, which Indian sportsperson has won.
The Asian Games are still on.
Greetings to all sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
Our girls are among those who have won medals for the country, which is a very positive sign.
Young sportspersons with medals are 15-16 years old.
Most of the medal-winning sportspersons live in small streets and villages, a good sign that they have achieved this success through hard work.
I once again wish the medal winners of the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons a very good presentation.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Namaskar Bhavnaji, I respect the thought of the child.
We have seen all of us constructing houses and buildings with rocks, but can you imagine the construction of an excellent, large and wonderful temple of a mountain that was about 1200 years ago that was a rock
But the Brihadeshwar Temple in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where there is an incredible combination of architecture and engineering.
The eleventh century Padakinar, known as Rani ki Wav, will surprise anyone at Pan in Gujarat.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He is Bharat Ratna, Dr.
M.
He is venerable in that part of the country, and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and sincerity.
The 15th of September is being celebrated as Engineers Day in his memory.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have displayed their distinct personality all over the world.
Now, when we commemorate the Engineers Day, we must think about the future.
There must be workshops.
Recently, Disaster Management has become a big issue.
The world is facing natural calamities.
What kind of structural engineering should it be
How can we determine the priorities of constructing waste without waste
We have to think when we are celebrating the Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Sometimes rain shows fondness due to India's geography and diversity.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
In Thailand, the team of 12 children, a football player, took their coach to the cave while drifting.
It'll take a few hours to get in and out of the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they searched for shelter on a small rock inside the cave - that's not a day or two, but a day or two.
If the children see death in front of them, you can imagine what the minute will be when they have to live with it every moment.
On the one hand, they were facing an accident, on the other hand, human values were being displayed simultaneously in the world.
People all over the world were praying for the safe release of these children.
But when the good news finally came, the world was comfortable.
But I feel like seeing this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it is important to learn and understand the behaviour of all.
A young soldier from Thailand's navy had to sacrifice his life in this venture.
The world is surprised that despite such a difficult situation, they have not given up their hopes with so much patience and patience in a dark cave full of water.
This shows that when humanity gathers together wonders happen.
The speciality of the poems of Nirj ji was to shine hope, faith, determination and self-confidence.
Everything we say to the Indians, Neeraj ji will be very powerful and inspiring.
It must be dark.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid floral tributes to Shri Neeraj ji.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is Truth.
I have been admissible for the first year student at Delhi University this year.
During our school board exams, you talked about the tensions and education of the exams and what is your message to students like me
July and August are very important for farmers as well as for the youth.
Because it's called the painting of colleges.
It's time for millions of youngsters like the truth to leave school and go to college.
In February and March, if the exam papers and answers are received, it is time to play holidays in April and wait for the results and decide the course of life and choose a career.
Children come from the shade of parents to the shadow of professors.
I firmly believe that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy from the beginning of their career.
For the first time, you will have to go out of the house and go out of the village and get out of a safe environment and be regulated.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be ready to join them.
I would like to tell you that be calm, enjoy life and know the joy of the soul in life.
There must be no choice but to learn, but to find new things.
The value of old friends is very big.
Friends of childhood are insignificant, but it is important to take care of their own ways of finding, making and maintaining new friends.
Learn something new, acquire new skills and learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the challenges, a student of a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, Asharam Chaudhary, was witnessing the success of surviving the harsh challenges of life.
Be it from a poor family or from a challenging environment, there are so many students who have worked to inspire and dedicate their lives.
Prince Kumar of Delhi, father DTC driver, and daughter Khushi of Nagpur, a school bus driver, and Kartik from Haryana, a father guardian, and a father-in-law friend of Jharkhand who works on his luxuries, are commendable.
If we look around, we can see a lot of examples like this.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspires me.
Once I was in Sanjoz city, known as the Technological Hub in America, I was interacting with Indian youth.
I asked them to think about how they can use their capabilities for India, it is time to do something.
I requested the brain drain to be transformed into brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Saheb and Rajneesh Vajpayee have taken a different step by adopting this challenge.
With their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together prepared the Smart Gauge App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the world but also makes them aware of any information and information on their own mobile phones.
The villagers of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli and the district magistrates and CDO have been inspired to use this app.
This app brings about a digital revolution in the village and it is easier to record, track and monitor all the developments in the village.
The app has all the phone directories, news sections, events list, health centres and information centres in the village.
This app is very beneficial for the farmers and the rural features of the App are being used as a market for their produce in a way.
If you look at this incident, you can see that the young man lives in America, in the midst of his lifestyle and thoughts, he will leave India several years ago, but he knows from the corner of his village, he understands the challenges, he has an emotional relationship with the village.
But sometimes because of scarcity of time, sometimes because of the distance, sometimes the slightest layer of skull is covered by the surroundings, but if a tiny canal touches it, everything appears once more, it leads to the past.
"Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course, Parpur Wari is a marvellous journey.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is being celebrated this time on July 23.
Pancharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before the Ekadashi of Asha, the pilgrims are on a pilgrimage to Parmarpur with teeth.
This journey, known as Vari, is being attended by millions of media persons.
Pilgrims reach there for the vision of Bhagwan Bhagwan Bhai Dhoba and Panduranga.
Bhagwan Bhagwan Bhaithal waits well for the poor, the deprived and the persecuted.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have great respect and devotion.
Going to the Vidhoba Temple in Kanpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual joy are different.
I would like to tell the listeners of Manki Baat that once I get the opportunity to participate in the Parpur Valley.
Number of holy masses like Gyaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still being reported to the common people in Maharashtra.
This sage tradition will continue to inspire every corner of Hindustan to fight against blind respect.
The message of harmony, love and brotherhood is received from all relevant customs.
It is a mandate to fight society with respect to blind respect.
The world leader was a man of courage and self-confidence.
He had the power and wisdom to show the British rulers their mistakes.
The British were afraid of him that he would try to commit treason three times in 20 years.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present an interesting story to you about Lokmanya Tilak and his idol in Ahmedabad.
During his visit to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came to welcome him today about a hundred years ago and during this journey Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to talk to him.
Lokmanya Tilak had a great impact on Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Naturally, the British dissatisfied with this, the Collector continued to admit it.
However, Sardar Saheb was a Sardar Saheb and he stood firm and had to abandon his position but he was determined to set up a statue of LokmanyaTilak.
The idol was finally constructed and on 28 February 1929, it was inaugurated not only by anyone but by Mahatma Gandhi.
The Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of the Lokmanya Tilak.
The Ganesh Festival was celebrated as a traditional honour and a festival and became a powerful medium for social awakening, social awareness, integrity and equality among the people.
It was a time to fight against the British in the country.
It is clear from this that our ancient heritage and our heroes of history are still interested in our younger generation.
Today you can see Ganesh Mandaps in many cities and all the streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn and develop leadership and organisational talent.
This time, from the statue of Ganesh Ji, all the ornaments should be environment friendly and the competition for environment friendly Ganesh Festival should be held in all the cities.
I'll surely bring all this to the people.
The world-class citizens have become self-confident, become a seal, Swadesh is our birthright and will achieve it.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our birthright.
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development.
This is the building of a New India.
50 years after the birth of Tilak, on the same day, on July 23, another son of Bharatmaba was born.
He sacrificed his life, assuming that we could breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Any young man who is not inspired to hear these lines will be in India, inspired by many youths like Sarfarashi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Mei Haidekhana Hai Geor Kitana, Baju-e-Katra Mei Hai, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and his enthusiasm for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Asad lived, but never bowed his head before the foreign rule.
A few days ago, the junior under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland created history by winning a brave woman and farmer Hima Das gold medal in the 400m race.
I was sent an e-mail in response to my letter to another of our daughters, who were waiting for the Asian Games from Indonesia.
I am proud that this is the most important moment in the life of any athlete, the tri-flag, and I am proud to have it.
Ekta, we are all proud of it.
The name of the solitude has been enlightened.
In Tunisia, the World Para Athletic Grand Pre-2018 won one gold and bronze medals.
I convey my greetings and best wishes to you all for your courage.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all of you for the centuries-long celebrations in this month of August, which will make you patriotic and healthy.
Once again we can reunite our Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have clearly understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams showed good performance in this game.
From Afghanistan side, Bouler Rashid Khan showcased the IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, tagged me and said, The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero, Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for making a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their potential.
Rashid Khan represents the big players in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done one thing as a model all over the world.
When the Indian team bought the trophy, they first called the Afghan team to participate in the international competition and took photographs.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will continue to participate in sports with sufficient sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, the fourth Yoga Day on 21st June was a different vision.
To see the whole world become one.
Indian and Chinese soldiers performed Yoga together on the high snowy peak of Ladakh.
Yoga breaks all the boundaries and unites people.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from over a hundred countries have made this occasion a big festival without caste, religion, region, colour and women.
Although people from all over the world have participated in Yoga Day programmes with so much enthusiasm, it is natural to have double enthusiasm in India.
It is a matter of pride for the country that 125 crore people of our country have practiced Yoga in the field of water and air.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga in the interior, some performed yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our Air Force fighters undertook yoga exercises at an altitude of 15,000 feet above the ground in the middle of the sky.
They did the yoga in the sky, not on the plane.
Yoga was conducted in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports.
Over the centuries, we have believed in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages and other sacred souls are focussing on any subject.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, several people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App to mention the Dress Day that will be held on 1st July this year at Mann Ki Baat.
That's right.
Only if we have a problem, remember the doctor.
But this is a day when we are celebrating the achievements of our doctors, this is an opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of a doctor is not confined to treating the disease.
Today the doctor has a medical expertise, and he has a great experience about the general lifestyle and how it affects our lives.
With their capabilities and skills, Indian doctors have emerged as individuals all over the world.
He said that the medical sector is well known for its hard work and for resolving the problems related to complicated treatment.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all our doctors on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a prosperous history without a month or a day of any historical event.
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Maghar on the 27th.
Do you know why he went to the grave
At that time there was a belief that those who died in Magahar would not have a paradise.
On the other hand, those who die in Kashi will be prosperous to heaven.
But Sant Kabir didn't believe it.
In today's era, they are so inspiring.
That is, the true spiritual saint knows and understands the pain of others.
He who doesn't know the pain of others is ruthless.
At that time, there was an upheaval and conflict in the world and he conveyed the message of peace and harmony.
Together with the universal minds, he worked to overcome disagreements.
His words are true even after centuries.
And a Guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
He has guided millions of people and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate caste differences in the society, and to see all humanity together and move away.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, 'Serving the poor and the deprived is God Seva'.
The 50th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I urge all of you to think about new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and new ideas about how Guru Nanak Dev's 50th Prakash Parv should be celebrated in the society and around the world.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific event that took place in Jallianwala Bagh, shamefully embarrassed the entire humanity, marks a hundred years in 2019.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written in the Narendra Modi Mobile App, on 6th July, 2018, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was born.
In this programme, he has written to the people about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
Ramanji, thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
In 1937, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation of the University of Calcutta in Bengali after receiving the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
It was for the first time that during the British rule, someone at the University of Calcutta had spoken in Bengali language at the convocation.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and built a strong platform.
In India's first industrial policy announced in 1948, the stamp of his ideas and philosophy has fallen.
It was his dream that India should be industrially self-reliant in all spheres and be skilled and prosperous.
He wanted the SMEs to focus on handlooms, dresses and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were set up between 1948 and 1950 to provide them financial assistance and organizational support for the proper development of cottage and small scale industries.
Dr Jitendra Singh said that India needs nationalisation in defence manufacturing as well.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the most important thing for India, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of fifty-two years.
Come on.
People talked about their imagination, comfort and achievements.
Girls in remote villages are providing services ranging from pension to passport to senior citizens of the village through Common Service Centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing ice-creaming industry with paddy.
Lakhs of youngsters from across the country run medicinal centres like Agnan Prakash in Jharkhand and deliver medicines at affordable prices to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal, who was wandering for employment two-three years ago, is successfully doing his own business today.
Not only that, they work for ten or five people.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues like waste management at their young age.
There are some in the society, without telling them disappointing things, without talking about defeats, without trying to create unbelief, there will be no peace without finding ways to unify.
In such a scenario, when the common man comes to ideas and new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not the service of the government.
Even a small child in a small village can be an inspiration for a hundred and fifty crore people.
With the help of technology, when I used to spend time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and motivated to do something.
A new joy, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration is available to devote life to the poorest of the poor.
I am grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We can enjoy the fragrance of good.
Something came to my attention the other day, it was a very different experience.
He worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers by making schemes related to the farmers.
In a way, farmers have a big role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, and at the same time, they are trying to ensure double profits by ensuring the share of farmers.
The seed bank has been built for it.
Women are looking for things in this Vitbunk and women are also linked to it.
Some may be I know, some may not have known, some may be aware, some may not know, but crores of people are continuously doing some good things, and everybody has the best wishes.
My dear countrymen, it is going to be a year in the process of GST.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it is really transformed.
There are people from different political viewpoints, people from different states, people from different priorities, but the decisions taken so far in the GST Council are unanimous.
There were several types of taxes in the country before the GST and only one type of tax was levied across the country.
GST is a success of honesty, it is a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint of Inspector Raj was raised in the country regarding taxation.
IT and Information Technology-Information Technology-Technologies have been replaced by the inspector in GST.
From Return to Refund, everything is being done online through IT.
GST was perhaps the largest tax reform in the world.
The biggest tax reform in India is that the people of the country have adopted it and the success of GST can be ensured through Jan Shakti.
It was generally thought that such a massive reform would take 5-7 years to achieve the fullest success of such a large population in such a large country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Good morning.
Navikas Sagar Parikrama Yes, I would like to say something about them.
These six women of India, their group, have returned to India on 21st May after roaming around the world in the sea for more than two and a half days.
The whole country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to see these women, listen to their travel experiences.
Once again, I congratulate the world for once again enhancing the valour of those women, enhancing the dignity of the Navy, especially of the Indian women.
Nobody has adventure.
If we look at the development journey of mankind, we can see that progress has been made from the womb of any adventure.
Development is at the heart of adventure.
On May 16, five tribal children from an ashram in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhru, Pramesh Ale, Umamantha Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam reached the highest peak in the world.
The children of the Ashram School started their training on August 2017 and were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Mashin Shaurya.
They made the country proud by conquering Everest in accordance with their names.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the people associated with Chandrapur School, to these youngsters.
At present, the 16-year-old Shivamgi Teacher became the youngest Indian girl to win Everest from Nepal.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those brave heroes, especially women.
Tagging each other and challenging them.
Everyone has joined this Fit India movement.
The film industry, the sportspersons, the common people of the country, the soldiers of the army and the teachers of the school participated in it and listened to it all around.
If we fit, India and fit...
Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian cricket team has also challenged me and I have accepted his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such a challenge will fit us and encourage others to fit.
My dear countrymen, you have heard several times about sports and sportspersons in Mann Ki Baat.
Last time the heroes of Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme, Namaskar sir.
"Thank you very much for calling me on the phone.
It is true that the games played in every street, which were a part of every child's life, are decreasing today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes at lunch, sometimes at night, after dinner, children used to play for hours without worry.
Outdor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games.
The same game is known in different names at different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It plays with 8:8 size square marbles, either with a blanket or a mud, or with a blanket.
This game was mostly played in all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, Paddi in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra and Dyam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you understand that people of all countries don't know language, yeah,
I'll tell you we're gonna play this game too.
Those who don't play kids or colours in their childhood.
Children play games in villages and cities.
Various names have been invited in different parts of the country.
In Andra Pradesh, it was called Godibilla or Karra Billa.
In Orissa, it is called Gulibadi, which is called Vittidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own climate, criticism.
Like the sword to fly.
When everybody flys a silver, everybody plays a game, the different qualities of ours can be expressed without any hesitation.
Great people will be serious, but when they play, the kid that's hidden in them comes out.
Traditional sports, along with physical talent, promotes our rational thinking, concentration, awareness and skilfulness.
At the same time, we know our culture and heritage.
Many games make us aware of society and environment.
Calling people, we can create a great history of our traditional sports.
This time, the fire, plastic waste is being defeated - beat plastic pollution.
I urge all of you to understand the emotions of this theme, to avoid using polyethylene, low-cost plastic, to reduce the immense impact on the nature of plastic waste, on wildlife and on our health.
Looking at the enormous suggestions made by the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 in a very attractive manner, let us know that they are working day to day life.
When it's very hot, when it's not over, when it's cold, everyone will start talking like experts about global waming, climate changing.
Is it a matter of fun
All this is basically climate change, its consequences.
Our culture, our heritage has not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi fought for this in all his life and every step.
Today, India is talking about climate justice, India has played a key role in the Cope 21 Paris Agreement, and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we go ahead with this
What can we do to be new
It's raining.
News has been received that preparations are being made to commemorate International Yoga Day on 21st June worldwide.
Yoga for Unity has been the world's re-recognition for the past few years.
Yoga always gives us the courage to live like our father.
If all these qualities are friendly to someone, the yogi succeeds in all forms of fear.
I once again urge all the people to build a healthy, prosperous and well-being nation to promote our heritage of Yoga.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
Panditji's prayers...
The memory of this month is linked to another person, the heroes.
In May 1957, Indians showed their strength to the British.
In 1857, Veerasawarkar wrote without fear that it was not a quarrel, but the first fight for freedom.
Savarkar's life was full of peculiarities.
But beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer, who always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has written a very good account of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar took poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and an adventurous revolutionary.
If there is an urge to do something, then it is possible to achieve success in all obstacles.
This is not just a matter of Seeker but you can see it at every corner of India.
If you look around, you can see how people defeat restrictions.
When we still go to a tea store, we enjoy tea there, we must have noticed that some people around there used to discuss and discuss.
These discussions may be politically related, socially, films, sports and sportspersons, this is the issue of the countrys problems, this is the solution that can be done in such a way.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called Asha-Ashvasan for children living on streets and slums, for which this poor teaker spends fifty percent of his income.
He provides education, health and food to all school going children.
I'm D.
I compliment Shri Prakash Rao for his dedication and dedication and for giving a new direction to the lives of poor children.
He has deprived the darkness of their life.
There must have been a lot of things going on around you.
There must be countless events.
Come on, let's encourage goodness.
We'll wait for the moon a few days.
I hope that everyone will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm and special gifts will be given to the children on this occasion.
I hope Eid strengthens harmony and friendship in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
We'll meet again in next month's Manki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from April 4-15.
71 countries including India participated in the event.
When such a big event is held, when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participate, imagine what will be the atmosphere there.
Who can stay away from this in an atmosphere of enthusiasm, passion, hope and hope and determination to achieve this
India records records in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton.
India has secured 66 medals, including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
Everything's drowned in the same feeling.
There will be a lack of words to clarify that feeling.
But I'd like to hear you from the players.
It was my dream to be a good player of India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants who have gone to participate in India this time have won medals
Manika Batra won medals in all these events.
She is the first Indian woman to have won the gold medal for India in the individual Table Tennis.
India received the highest medal in shooting.
Fifteen year old filmmaker Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player to win gold medal for India at Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter who won the medal in the Commonwealth Games for India.
This time there are more women than medal winners.
Whether it is a squash or a boxing or a weightlifting or a shooting, women are amazed.
The last fight in Badminton was Indias two sportspersons Saina Nehwal and P.
It was between Sindhu.
Everyone had the courage to get two medals for India even if it was a competition.
The game players from different parts of the country went from small towns.
They have the role of their powerful friends in all surroundings.
Last month at Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, Fit India.
Come, collaborate with Fit India and urge them to lead Fit India.
I am very happy that people are very enthusiastic.
Shishikanth Bhosle has written sharing his own picture in the swimming pool, My Weapon Essy Body, My Element Es Water, My World Ess Swimming...
Dhawal Prajapati has written sharing his own picture of trekking, travel and trekking for me is Fit India.
It was a pleasure to see many renowned people inspire our youth for Fit India in a very attractive manner.
Sanima Kalakaran Akshay Kumar has shared a video in the film.
You must see that he's exercising with Wooden beads.
He says that this exercise is very good for outer and stomach muscles.
Another video is in publicity.
He's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences with Fit India initiatives.
I think such initiatives are very useful for all of us and all over the country.
Another thing is to say, Yoga is the name of the costless Fit India Movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have been preparing for it.
The significance of the International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been recognized by the whole world.
You'll be ready now.
Your city, your village, your colony, your school, your college, everywhere, everywhere, everybody, every age group, every man or woman, must make efforts to connect with Yoga.
Today, there is no need to specify whether in India or in the world how Yoga benefits for the overall development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You must have seen that my animated video is very popular.
Animations have done whatever they need to show a teacher very minutely.
You will also benefit from it.
I would like to say something by inviting you for a new job.
Many youngsters recently spend their time learning something new.
Otherwise, the internship offers a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to live a new life by avoiding paper, pen and computer.
My young friends, I invite you for a special internship.
The Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 has been launched in collaboration with three Ministries of Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water.
Students from colleges, youngsters from NCC, NSS and Nehru Yuva Kendra Volunteers, if they want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to do something for the transformation of the society and if they want to do so, they can join it.
This will give a boost and support to cleanliness, and it will be a pleasure to be able to do something before the celebration of the centenary celebration of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
The awards will be given at the national level to the best participants, the best performing in colleges and the best performing in the university.
Not only this, the UGC will provide two credit points to those who are very well finished.
I invite students, students and youngsters to internships once again and benefit them.
Going to MyGov, you can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope our youth will come forward in this movement for cleanliness.
I'm keen to know about your efforts.
Tell me what you know, tell me about the events, send a photo, send a video.
Use this vacation for a new experience.
I would like to appeal to the people to see that how many good things are being done in every corner of our country, we can see what good things are happening.
I have seen the story of youngsters who are selflessly gathering for the education of poor children.
A grand programme has been started to educate the children of the streets of Dalli and children living in the huts of these youths.
The condition of children begging on the road or working on small jobs grabbed them so that they left for this creative work.
Young people and teachers associated with this programme have moved away from their busy life for two hours to make social changes.
Brothers and sisters, similarly, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are a source of inspiration for farmers across the country.
They have changed not only their own destiny but also the destiny of the region.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly cultivated by Ragi, Chaulai, corn or barley.
The farmers didn't get the value they deserved because they were mountainous.
This biscuit with iron ore is very beneficial for pregnant women.
These farmers formed a cooperative group in Munar village and started a biscuit manufacturing factory.
Looking at the courage of the farmers, the government also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
The biscuits are now reaching not only in Bageshwar district but also in 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani.
With the help of farmers, the annual turnover of the group has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but more than 900 households have been employed so that the employment of people from the district is reduced.
Do we think that water conservation is a social responsibility
Imagine how to protect every rainbow.
We know that water conservation is not a new subject in the minds of Indians.
Not the subject of the book, not the subject of the language.
Our ancestors have lived this for centuries.
They gave priority to the glory of each drop of water.
They're looking for new ways to keep every drop of water safe.
There are very large inscriptions in Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Pudukotai and many ponds are like tourist centres even today.
But do not forget that these huge reserves of water resources are living examples of the efforts of our ancestors.
The well-known ponds of Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat are UNESCO World Heritage Centres and their excellence is worth seeing.
These ponds are in a way Jal temples .
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and most beautiful Bavadi (Kolumbhs) in India, which is one of the most remarkable areas of the country.
The time of April, May, June and July is a good time for rainwater harvesting and we will be able to harness the amount of preparations that we have made earlier.
In the last three years, water conservation and water management have done something in their own way.
In 2017-18, Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on 55 of total expenditure, i. e.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted by such water conservation and water conservation.
Sasur and Khaderi rivers, which were dried up with the help of people from around 40-45 villages, were revived.
Whether it is animals or birds, whether it is a farmer or a farmer, whether it is a village, how blessed it is for all of them
Anan Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village in North 24 Fargan district of West Bengal has written in MyGov: We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about the vision of living peacefully, beautifully and integratedly.
Please, people should discuss this issue in the Manki Baat programme to know about this.
His penance was a magnificent mudra for all, a brilliant personality and a multi-faceted personality.
I had the habit of listening to it, not knowing the language, but waking up early in the morning and listening to the radio music became my habit... enjoyment...
You and Rabindra Sangeeta may have influenced his poems very much.
I salute Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with due respect and respect throughout the world.
The social aspect of fasting is that when man is hungry himself, he knows the hunger of others.
When we thirst ourselves, we know the thirst of others.
Once a man asked the prophet what was best in Islam.

According to the prophet Muhammad, one person is rich not only by the sacred soul but by the wealth and wealth.
We must be proud that India is the land of great Lord Buddha, showing the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, and he has guided millions of people all over the world.
Recalling this entire Buddha, Lord Buddha, he reminds us of our responsibilities to strive, resolve and live according to the path he has shown.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the most important human value in the world today.
Buddhas inspiration is very much from Babasaheb Ambedkars social vision.
Baba Saheb lays the foundation for saying that my social vision has been established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my philosophy are in religion, not in political science.
I have imbibed them from my Master Buddha.
Millions of persecuted, exploited, deprived and marginalized millions have been empowered through the Babasaheb Constitution.
There is no greater example of compassion.
This compassion for the suffering of the people was one of the greatest benefits of Lord Buddha.
Everywhere in Asia, the advice of Lord Buddha has been inherited.
I am happy to note that the Government of India is involved in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the magnificent magnificent Anand Mandir of Myanmar for centuries.
Today, all over the world, there is a vision of conflict and humanitarian pain, and the advice of Lord Buddha shows the way to dispel hatred with kindness.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the people of the world who believe in the principles of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha.
For the entire world, I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha for building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his advice.
There has been a new confidence for the people of India spread all over the world.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Pokhran, Rajasthan, on the west coast of India.
It is now twenty years since it was the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's experiments were successful and India was able to showcase science and technology.
The day is marked as an exhibition of military might in the history of India.
Lord Buddha showed the world that the strength of the inner soul is essential for peace.
And when you become a nation, you will be able to live in peace with all of you.
It is not only because of the certification conducted in May 1998, but it is also important for the country to do so.
India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India will fall new goals and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.

Anagha, Jesus from Chennai and many children have written to me about the gratitude cards given behind the book "Exam Warrior".
In so many letters, so many phone calls and opinions, I have read and heard a lot of things have touched my heart.
Even if I talk about them, I'll have to talk for months.
In the summer, we told you about the water for birds.
There are letters from farmers and brothers and sisters regarding the functioning of Kisan Melas and Farming across the country.
Some people have sent suggestions about water conservation.
In the festival season, there will be letters about our festivals, our culture, our traditions etc.
Why don't you change in these things, in these experiences, in these examples, there is so much inspiration, energy, commitment and enthusiasm for doing something for the country.
This will empower the entire country to change the weather.
When I can see the indomitable will power of this country when I know that a rickshaw driver from Karinganch in Assam, Ahmed Ali has built 9 schools for poor children through his will.
When Dr. Ajit Mohan Chaudhari of Kanpur came to know about the interaction between the people of this country when he heard the story of examining the poor and giving them free medicines.

After twelve years of collection of such funds, the last step taken by Saidul Laskar was to showcase the spirit of genuineness.
Due to his hard work and determination, a 30-bed hospital has been constructed in Revillage near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, the world has changed its perspective towards India.
We are moving forward amongst all sections of the society, there is a belief that our country is moving forward.
This self-confidence, this positivity will help in realizing our resolve for a New India, and it will be a dream-satellite.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That's why a lot of letters are related to agriculture.
This time, I saw a video of discussions with farmers on Doordarshan's DD Kisan channel, and all farmers must contact the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan.
The feeling that Mahatma Gandhi was interested in soil, farming, farming and farming is evident in this line, he said, To forget how to diagnose the truth and to tell the soil, is to forget ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri strongly advocated the preservation of trees, plants and trees, and the need to adopt good farming practices.
Ram Manohar Lohia spoke about the need for a large number of people to rise to ensure better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities, and to increase production of food items and milk.
In a speech in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies and innovations.
I had gone to the farming festival held in Delhi recently.
I was very happy to have my discussions with the farmers brothers and scientists, my experiences related to agriculture, understanding and knowing new discoveries related to agriculture.
But the biggest impact on me was Meghalaya and the farmers of that place.
This state, with a very small area, has shown a great deal of work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya produced records over the last five years in 2015-16.
I would like to mention in detail the MSP, the wages of other workers on a small amount of expenditure, the cost of their cattle, machines or machines rented, the cost of seeds, the cost of all types of fertilizers used, the cost of irrigation, the interest paid to the state government, the interest paid on the working capital, the rent of the land, not only this, but also the immovable value of the farmer or his family, who is involved in the farming.
Besides, a large number of measures are being taken to bring about agricultural market reforms in the country to ensure fair price for farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect the rural markets with the market in Holsey and with the global market.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the commencement of the centenary year celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve.
Besides, how can a hundred twenty five crore people join their shoulders and pay their best tributes to Gandhiji
I appeal to all of you to share your views with MyGov.
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, spell, or what should be a celebration
Today, the country has moved from traditional methods in the health sector.
Everything related to health in the country was already the responsibility of the Health Ministry.
Today, all the departments and Ministries, be it the Ministry of Swachhata or the Ministry of AYUSH or be it the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, are working together for a healthy India.
Immunity is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
The more aware we are in disease prevention, the better the individual, the family and the society.
If life is to be healthy then it is clean first.
As a nation, we took the challenge together and as a result, sanitation coverage doubled in four years to nearly 80 percent.
Besides, widespread work is being done to create healthcare centres across the country.
Today, Yoga has become a peoples movement, it is because of the dedication of all of us to home.
This time, the International Day of Yoga is just 100 days left to reach 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the world have joined hands with enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
The new attractive methods of Yoga must inspire children, youth and senior citizens.
Throughout the year, various programmes related to Yoga are being organized on TV and electronic media.
Can we create an awareness about Yoga as a campaign from now on to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share that video with you... so that we can learn asanas and pranayama together.
It's going to help them.

My dear countrymen, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For him, the industry was a good medium to provide employment to the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India campaign in the country, Dr.
In keeping with his vision, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission have been launched in the country today, so that all types of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country, be it good roads or water supply, be it health facilities or education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-sufficiency.
He wanted that no person should live in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that his poverty could not be overcome only because he had widened something for the poor.
Today initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are giving birth to our young stakeholders.
He emphasized the importance of water consumption for the development of the country and various river valley authorities, various water related commissions are all born in the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to bring history to the waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the importance of federalism and federalism, and working together between the Centre and the States for the growth of the nation.
He showed that it is not necessary for us to be born in a big or wealthy family to reach the heights, but for those who are born in a poor family in India, we can see dreams, we can make efforts to realise those dreams and we can achieve success.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar is funny.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to participate in this event with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the coming days, the Jayanti of Lord Mahavira, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishakhi.
On the Jayanti of Lord Mahavir, it is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire us all.
Greetings to all the people on Mahavir Jayanti.
When you talk about Easter, you will recall the inspiring advice of Jesus Christ, and he gave the message of peace, harmony, justice and compassion to mankind.
Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science, they have written a few.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that the water is not colored.
Have we ever imagined why the water on the river or the ocean looks colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that gave birth to a scientist in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, for the first time, India has become a Centre of Excellence.
One of his findings is known as Raman Effect.
It is said that this is the day he found the truth about light skating and this is why he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Hargovind Khurana and scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are also proud of India.
The famous Boson Party has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a function in Mumbai and inaugurated the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was heartening to know about the wonders in the field of science.
The Artificial Intelligence will help in the manufacture of robots, boots and other machines with a definite objective.
Now machines make their brain smarter by self-learning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence could help in ease of living for Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can we know more about natural calamities through artificial intelligence
Can farmers help in farming
Will Artificial Intelligence help in making healthcare accessible to all and treating diseases in a modern way
On the same day, the Israeli Prime Minister, along with the Prime Minister, had the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of the iCreate programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
A young man told me about the development of a digital device there.
I think many such things can use artificial intelligence.
Scientific technologies can be called Value Nutral.
Any machine we want will work.
But it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Tomas Alva Edison, who discovered the illuminating bulb, failed several times in his experiment.
Once he asked me about this, he replied, I looked for ten thousand ways to find the Bulb.
I mean, Edison has made his own failures strong.
Fortunately, fortunately, I am in Aravalli today, the land of Maharishi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised many questions to British India.
The idea of asking questions again to know the truth is great.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't be calm until you get answers to what.
On this occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to the scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all issues related to security and disaster during the crisis, people write to me something related to it.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune and Shri Narendra Modi on Mobile App are dedicated to the safety of jobs.
He has written that there are no safety norms in our country where factory and construction work is going on.
Next March 4 is Indias National Safety Day and hence people should also talk about security in the Prime Ministers Mann Ki Baat programme.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, initiatives and preparation.
One needs safety during disastrous and the other is a daily life - safety in averted life .
If we don't care about security in our daily lives, it's hard to be in danger.
We must have often written on the boards that are on the way: If you don't mind, the accident will certainly cause a mistake, it will lose happiness and laughter and ensure safety without leaving the world so fast.
I would like to say that the fire brigades in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to schools once a week or once a month to showcase the mock drills in front of the children.
So there will be two advantages and the habit of ferry brigade will be cautious and the new generation will be able to know a lot about it.
In terms of dangers, India is a country of diversity, geographical and climate resilient.
This country has witnessed many disasters like natural disasters, chemical disasters and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stands at the forefront of mitigating accidents in the country.
NDMA is rapidly reaching out to rescue operations in various accidents like earthquake, floods, cyclones and landslides.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives annually due to heat wave.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave decreased to about 220.
It can be understood from this that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
I congratulate all those who have been involved in such activities in society, there are innumerable social organisations, there are aware citizens who have come with the help of salvation in minutes whenever there is a danger.
The number of such unnamed heroes is no less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, the National Disaster Response Forces, the Armed Forces, the Paramilitary Forces, etc. , are in danger and they are brave and helping people without losing their lives.
We have to make a society that takes care of the accident.
In our culture, we preserve values, often talk about protective values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
In our normal lives, we travel hundreds of times by plane, we see Air Hostess initially warning of security.
We must have heard it a hundred times, but somebody takes us on the plane and tell us where everything is going, where is the life jacket
So our ears on the plane have the habit of hearing, but we don't think these warnings are with me either.
This is what happens in all walks of life.
We shouldn't think of security for anyone else.
If we are all aware of our security, the emotions of social security must have been incorporated in it.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, with the objective of Swachh Bharat, west to energy of the villages was emphasized.
The objective of the Gobar Dhan Yojana is to transform the villages into cleaning, fertilizer and farm waste, composta and biogas, thereby producing wealth and energy.
The number of cattle in India is the highest in the world, with around 300 million cattle and about 3 million tonnes of coconut production per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme, we are also moving forward in this regard.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help keep the village clean.
I invite you to be a part of this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job and come forward to make the waste of your village wealthy and transform the waste into cooking fuel.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about a variety of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
However, the first Churum Festival of the state was organized as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
The objective of this festival organized by the Raipur Festival was to create awareness about cleanliness and to take care of the unique ways in which the waste of the city can be used actively and recycled.
During this festival, various programmes were organized and the elderly people participated in it.
Inspired by Raipur, different trash festivals have been organized in other districts.
Everyone has done many things in their own way and shared new ideas about cleanliness, discussed and recited poetry.
The importance of dirt and hygiene was presented in a renewed way in this festival, where the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of that place, congratulated everyone.
Every year on March 8, International Women's Day is celebrated.
A lot of programmes are being organized in our country and around the world.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country and felicitated all those who have done exemplary work in various fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development beyond women's development.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's words.
He said that the idea of complete womenhood is complete freedom, and Swami ji's vision, twenty-five years ago, reflects the perception of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in all spheres of social and economic life, and it is our responsibility.
We are a part of the legacy that men are recognized by women and children are known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandhan, Gandhari-Puthan.
Today, our women power shows self-confidence and self-confidence through their actions.
They carried the country and the society forward and brought them to a new goal.
Our vision of New India is ultimately an equal partner in the overall development of a nation with women-powered, empowered and nation-wide.
There can be many examples of what women power can do and if you look around, you can see such stories that inspire life.
From Jharkhand, I have one thing to know.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand should not be less than this number - 15 lakh women organised a one-month cleanliness campaign.
These women in Jharkhand have shown that Swachhta movement can be transformed into a habit of a common man in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, two days ago, in three villages on the island of Elephanta, they had seen electricity after 70 years of independence and saw how happy the people there were.
You know that Elephanta island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
It is an attractive tourist destination.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that the villages and caves of Elephanta will now see the light of electricity.
This is not just electrification but a new beginning of development.
May the light shine in the lives of the people, may there be happiness in life... when will there be more happiness and excitement than this
My dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivratri the last day.
Now, in the month of March, it is time to harvest abundant farmland with harvesting crops, fig seeds spreading wheat and other golden seeds and boiling monkeys, which are the hallmarks of this month.
And this month is a month of dearness for everyone because of the festival of Holi.
On the 2nd of March, everyone will celebrate Holi with fervor.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much. Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in this celebration.
He paid homage to Kalpana Chaula, who had travelled in space on 1st February.
We were separated from the accident in the Colombian space ship but they inspired millions of youngsters all over the world.
The loss of Kalpana Chaula at such a young age is a matter of sadness for all of us.
It is heartening to see that in India, these women are moving forward in every sphere and making the nation proud.
In ancient times, the respect for women of our country, their place in the society, their contributions, all over the world is astonishing.
There is a long tradition of Indian adults.
Tell me about Bai Bachao, Bai Padhao.
But in ancient times, writers say in Skandapuran - Dashuputra, Samanya, Dashuputra Kamdhyayaya, that result is available Martha, Tatya Availability is a virtue.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and ten sons will get their respect in one row.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why in our society women have been given the status of strength.
This woman power brings the whole country together, the entire society, the entire family into the brink of unity.
Whether it is the legendary scholars of Vaidikas Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, the knowledge and devotion of Akamahadevi and Meerabai, be it the ruler of Ahalyabai Holkar, be it the courage of Rani Laxmibai, women power is inspiring for us.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted fellow citizens on the occasion of International Day of Yoga.
Prakash Trichary continues to give several examples.
Our brave Raksha Mantri, Nirmala Sitharaman, wrote that it is inspiring to fly a fighter plane on May 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, the women members of the Indian Navy have written about the surroundings of the world at INSV Tarini.
He mentioned the brave women, Bhavnakanth, Mohan Singh, who are the pilots of Chaturvedi Ever Warfare and trained in Sukhoi 30.
Women led by Kakshita Vajpayee are proud to be flying to San Francisco, USA in Delhi and to Delhi in Air India's Boeing Jet.
Remember all women...
The first woman to receive NAM - the first woman Marchant Navy captain, the first female train driver of the yatra train, the first female fire fighter - the first female bus driver from Antarctica, the first woman from Antarctica, the first woman from Everest, and the first woman from Everest who had taken the lead in all these fields, she embraced extraordinary vision by breaking the dynamics of our women power society.
They have called upon all obstacles and obstacles to break a new path by working hard, working hard and determining.
Not only their contemporary people, but also the way to inspire the future generations.
A new enthusiasm and inspiration will fill them.
A book on these women who have acquired Neem will be prepared so that not only the country but also the women power should know about it. You should inspire them in their lives.
This is available for e-books on the Narendra Modi Web Site.
Women power has an important role to play in the positive changes that are taking place in the country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, I would like to talk about a railway station.
You must have imagined the relationship between railway station and women empowerment.
The Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for all workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a Maoist-affected area.
Violence, invasions, bombs, guns and pistols are a terrible atmosphere that Maoists built there.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a terrible area by driving e-o rickshaws.
In a very short span of time, a lot of women have been associated with it.
Along with this, it will also help in environmental protection.
The district administration has played a very important role in the success of these women from the compliment of the district weight and from providing the grants.
For centuries, in our society, individuals and socially continue to strive against social evils and evils.
A few days ago, we had such a beginning in Bihar.
Thousands of kilometres length of the world's largest humanitarian activity in the state to root out social misconduct.
Through this clutches, he awakened the social consciousness against the evils of child marriage, women's system, etc.
The state has resolved to fight evils such as women and child marriage.
The youngsters, mothers and sisters, who were enthusiastic and enthusiastic, all of them participated in this fight.
The human chain, which began in the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, was unprecedented across the border of the state.
Societies must be free from evils to achieve the rightful development for all of us.
Come, let us together pledge to free our society from evils and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
He was unaware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
Eli now knows about the Janaushadhi Pariyojana and when you started buying deer, the deer cost fell by 75.
For the past few days, a lot of people used to write about it and I used to talk about it.
The objective of the scheme is to provide healthcare to everyone and enhance ease of living.
Deer sold at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50 to 90 less than branded deer.
That's why good deers are available at a low price.
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
There is also a new employment opportunity not only for deserts but also for individuals who want to find jobs.
Value deer are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at Amrit stores in hospitals.
There is only one objective in PIL which is to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor, thereby creating a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola have organised a cleanliness drive to clean the Morna river as per the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna River flows for twelve months before and Eli continues to flow only during the rainy season.
The river is completely full of potatoes and potatoes and it is painful.
A lot of waste is thrown out of the river and its shores.
On January 13, a day before Makar Sankranti, the first step of Mission Clean Morna was to clean both sides of the Morna River at 14 locations in 4 km area.
More than 4000 people from Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college-school students, girls, adults, mothers and sisters participated in the Mission Clean Morna.
On 20th January, 2018, the Swachhta Hi Seva movement has taken place, and the programme will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna River becomes completely dirty.
It's impossible for anyone to do something.
A massive change can be brought about through the mass movement.
I compliment the people of Akola, the district administration and the administrative authorities of the state for making this work a peoples movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about Padma awards these days.
Newspapers and television showcases this issue.
Every year Padma Awards are routine, but for the last three years it has changed its pattern.
Any citizen can nominate anyone.
All the processes have been liberalized so that there is transparency in it.
In a way, the electoral process for these awards has changed completely.
Generally, Padma Awards are given to those who are not present in cities, newspapers, TV and conferences.
The award for Arvind Gupta will be given by Kay.
You will be happy to know that IIT Kanpur is a student who has dedicated your life to making toys for these Aravindan daughters.
He has been making toys with things that have been abandoned to increase scientific profile in Kundi for four decades.
He also tried to inspire scientific experiments to carry out scientific experiments with abandoned items.
For this, films made in 18 languages in 3000 schools across the country inspire Kai Kudis.
Generate surprise and dedicate life to wonder.
A story like this is the story of Sitawa Jodhatti of Karnataka.
Don't just tell the goddess of women's empowerment.
Over the last three decades, they have contributed greatly to transforming the lives of innumerable women.

Five hundred green deserts have been built on their own memory.
There is a special privilege in making a desert for serpentine.
Laxmiji continues to serve the society through his own knowledge of green peacocks.
The world's well-known personality is recognized by Padma Shri to contribute to the society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without medical treatment and this was inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Thousands of poor people will be treated free of cost at the hospital, built through their hard work.
Sometimes they should be invited to schools and colleges and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there must be some effort of the society.
My dear countrymen, every year on January 9, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.

I am extremely glad that people of different countries live in India, people of different roots have served those countries, they have maintained their strong relationship with India and this time the European Union has sent me calendars.
Our people of Indian origin live in different countries of Europe - some work on cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are composed of their music, some poetry, some are composing the minds of the society.
30th January is a memorable day for all of us.
On the occasion of martyrdom day, we pay homage to the great martyrs who laid down their lives for the defence of our country at 11 o'clock.
They're not just theories.
My dear countrymen, convey my best wishes to all of you for 2018 and end my speech.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
This will be the last day of Mann Ki Baat this year and the last day of 2017.
I have shared a lot of things with you this year.
The year will change after a few hours, but the sharing of our ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christmas, we remember the great teachings given by Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ gave great importance to service.
We see the essence of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhansar used to say, "Serving our lives with devotion".
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Personally, he had to lose a lot of things in this effort.
It was a very fortunate occasion for me to participate in the light festival organized by Guru Gobind Singh at Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 300th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh earlier this year.
Let us decide with all our hearts that we will learn from the great lessons taught by Guru Gobind Singh and from the life that is inspiring and inspirational.
1st January, 2018, that is tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But I repeat that it is really special when I say it is special.
Indian democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
All this India is encouraging you to welcome the voters of the 21st century.
You must be proud to be a voter in the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The strength of the vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Voting is one of the most effective in bringing about a progressive change in the lives of millions of people.
You don't have the right to vote.
You can become the creators of the 21st century by thinking about how India should be in the 21st century, what your dreams should be about India in the 21st century.
The youth of New India is synonymous with enthusiasm, enthusiasm and energy.
New India's dream is realized through these vibrant, skillful and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it is about a free India from casteism, casteism, terrorism and corruption.
India free from waste and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunity, New India is fulfilling the aspirations of everyone.
New India is a power that guides us in peace, unity and harmony.
My new India youth should come forward and analyze how a New India will emerge.
How can we realize our visions before 2022
How can we create India like our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom struggle into a peoples movement.
My young friends, we have to organize a mass movement to create a grand and divine India of the 21st century.
A mass movement for development, a peoples movement for progress, a capable and capable India.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been opened for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and industry entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and winning.
I would like to imagine how the youth of this New India can get information about the schemes that are opening up such opportunities and I would like them to develop a system that can benefit from these schemes and the world at the age of 18.
There is nothing impossible for a person full of emotional thought and enthusiasm.
Pesimism leads to weekends, optimism to power.
The following reports and responses were really encouraging.
It was very comfortable.
Some people shared the positive impact that had a special impact on their minds.
Some shared their personal gains.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm talking from a bodel place.
According to my husband's instructions, one rupee insurance premium was charged every month.
He died in an accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
Our Village Village is going to National Highway since 2017.
My name is Satish Bawani.
Our area had scarcity of water and for the last 40 years we have been dependent on the pipeline of the soldiers.
Now we put a special pipeline...
It has been our biggest achievement in 2017.
The positive changes in the lives of people are many of these things in their own way.
In fact, this is the new India that we are building together.
Recently, I have come to know about the inspiring story of Amjai and Bashir Khan Khatk in frontline of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He was freed from the poison of terrorism and hatred and reached the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had burnt his legacy in 1990.
His family would have to quit and flee their legacy, so much so that there was terrorism and violence.
He chose a different route for himself, a way to serve the people.
Avoiding opposite environments, he wrote the story of victory himself.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the country.
Amaz has proved that however bad the surroundings may be, through a positive step, the cars of despair can be disappointed.
Last week, I had the opportunity to see some girls from Jammu and Kashmir.
There was enthusiasm, enthusiasm, energy, dreams and determination.
I was inspired by the time I spent with those children.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the Shabarimala temple in Kerala, not only about my country but also about the famous religious places of the world.
Every year crores of devotees reach this world famous temple to receive the blessings of Lord Ayappaswamy.
How big a challenge can it be to ensure that there is so much devotion to the devotees and to wait for such a great place without waste
If there are mountains and jungles then you can specifically tell
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme titled Punyam Punkavan which has started a self-confidence campaign of awareness about waste management.
Any devotee, whoever comes, has made a habit that he will not complete his journey without doing any physical work in terms of cleanliness.
There's no bigger in this campaign, no smaller.
Every devotee considers himself a part of the worship of God and works for cleanliness, works and works for cleanliness.
Every morning, the vision of cleanliness here is very amazing, the pilgrims are all participants.
No matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how big an officer is, everybody participates in the cleanliness programme like a common devotee.
There are many examples before us.
It becomes a part of the pilgrimage of all the devotees to observe such a cleanliness drive in Shabarimala.
There is a strong survival and a determination to ensure cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we have taken a pledge to fulfil Bapus vision of a Swachh Bharat and a Clean India.
Bapu spent his entire life working for this one thing.
The collaboration between the people in the rural and urban areas has undergone a massive transformation.
Swachh Survekshan-2018, the worlds largest survey of cleanliness, will be conducted between 4th January and 10th March, 2018 to assess the achievements of cleanliness in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4000 cities and about 40 crore people.
I'll talk to the citizens and know their response.
Analysis of the use of Swachhata App and upgradation of various types of service centres will also be undertaken.
In order to transform the city's sanitation into a people's habit, all arrangements for the city's transformation into a city will be checked.
Don't let the government do cleanliness.
All citizens and civil society have a great responsibility.
I urge all the people to take part in the Swachhata Survey that will take place in the coming days.
Try not to leave your city behind, so that your streets and villages do not lag behind.
On the basis of this survey, cities will be ranked - if your city is more than one lakh people, if there are fewer populations in the rankings across the country then it should be your dream that you have the highest position in the local ranking.
Come, with this determination, once again, we can use the best efforts with the resolve of Swachh Bharat to recall Bapu.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem very small to vision but as a society, there is a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
For decades Muslim women were being dealt with injustice, but no one even talked about it.
There's no such law in many Islamic countries.
But the Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without menstruation.
I have suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all women applying to go alone are allowed to go to Haj.
Generally, the elections are being held on Haj pilgrimage, and I would like to give them a special opportunity to look at the women who have applied to go alone.
The development journey of India has been carried forward on the basis of their talent by the strength of our women power.
I firmly believe that our women and men must have equal rights and have equal opportunities and we must strive together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, it will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, leaders from ten ASEAN countries will be the chief guests of the Republic Day celebrations.
This time, on Republic Day, there will be not one, not ten chief guests.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and completed 25 years of Indias alliance with ASEAN in 2017 itself.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to join together these great leaders from 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is a festival festival festival festival festival festival festival festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
There's never been a day that's not connected to the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas, and the new year is going to come.
May the coming year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move forward with new zeal, new enthusiasm, happiness and new resolve.
Makar Sankranti is celebrated this month as the sun moves towards Uttaranchal in January.
This is a festival related to nature.
Sankranth in Rajasthan says that all festivals like Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in their own way and they have their own importance.
These festivals are celebrated between 13th January and 17th January.
All the names of these festivals are different, but basic principles are the same.
Once again my best wishes for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear people.
Man Ki Baat, September 2019
She is older than us, she is a witness to every step of the country and every era.
I had the privilege of talking to Didi before my arrival abroad.
It was a lovely conversation like talking to brother and sister.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modiji - Ladadi, Pranam.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
I extend my best wishes and best wishes on the occasion of birth anniversary of Modi Ji and Didi.
May Didi be healthy, may we all have the blessings of Didi.
I was telephoning Didi before I went to America.
It was a pleasure to hear the phone call from Netaji and Modi ji.
You gonna get back to when
Everyone at home...
Lataji, I think that the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners are due.
You don't know what you are.
I know that as soon as you come, the picture of India is changing.
Modi ji yes.
Mother is very happy with this love of Modi ji and Didi.
I am extremely grateful that Modi ji and Didi always remember me.
Once again I extend my best wishes.
When Modiji came to Mumbai this time, it was good to see him.
Modi ji but I will be here soon.
Modi ji should come home and eat something Gujarati from Didi's hand.
Lataji, of course.
I'm lucky to think that.
Modi ji, Pranam Didi.
Greetings to Lata Ji.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Namaste.
Namaste.
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the times of celebrations have once again come with new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new determination.
For weeks, the whole country will be filled with the glory of festivals.
Everyone in the family will join in the festivals.
It's called the dark under the light.
Perhaps, the only word in this statement is an order for all of us, a vision, a motivation.
On the one hand, when many houses are bright and on the other hand, think of having darkness on the other side in front of them.
When this darkness disappears, the real joy of these festivals comes when it shines light.
They've collected clothes, sweets and food from people's homes and searched for the demands and delivered them.
Would you like to try to bring darkness under the light with sufficient awakening and determination on this occasion of festivals this time
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals, your face will be shining, your light will be more bright, your light will be more shining.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
In our culture, women are considered to be Lakshmi because women bring good fortune and prosperity.
In our midst there will be a lot of women who shining the name of their own self-dedication, wisdom, family and society and country.
Would you like to organize a programme to honour these Laxmis of India on the occasion of Diwali
We'll have many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things.
Our society should recognize such women, honour them and take pride in their name.
All of us, together, will propagate this as the world has propagated a mass movement called Selfie with daughter.
Likewise, this time, a mass movement called Bharat Key Lakshmi will be organized.
Encouraging India's Laxmi is to strengthen the path of prosperity for the people of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I have already said that it is my good fortune to have a direct and indirect interaction with many people whom I know through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Last day, a student from Arunachal, too far, sent a very interesting letter to me.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when my examination results came, people asked me if I had read a book called Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
If I had read that book before the exam, I would have been very good.
And this little girlfriend has given me a job.
But I have a request for you to help me.
I must read it.
I'll think about it and I think I'm right about it. I'll try to write it in my own words.
Once again I express my gratitude to this young friend of Arunachal, student Alina Thyang.
Look.
This time, as discussed about victory in the U. S. operation, the speech of Colonel Up Daniel Medvedev was also discussed and good publicity was received in the social media.
I saw the speech and watched the game.
The simplicity of Dan Madvedev, 23, attracted everyone and his spirit.
Of course it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he won the Grand Slam 19 times and defeated Rafael Nadal, the legendary of Tennis.
If there were any others on this occasion, they would be sad and disappointed.
His words were welcomed by the audience.
Nadal commended Champya Nadal in Dan, how Nadal had inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and zeal of the failing man in the same game must be seen.
If you don't listen to Dan Medvedev's words, I would like to tell all of you, especially the youngsters that I must watch that video.
It has a lot to learn from all sections of the society, from all ages, and it is a great moment beyond the triumph.
Victory is no big deal.
Life is a victory.
This has been described in our countrys sciences in a very beautiful way.
The thoughts of our ancestors must be appreciated.
It has been stated in the audience that Loksya Lakshanananda means that if a person has a qualification and humility together, his mind cannot win.
In fact, this young sportsperson captured the minds of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, I am going to tell you this thing directly for your goodness.
There will be debates, parties and disagreements, but there will be great benefits if some things can be stopped even before it grows.
When it's too big, it's too difficult to stop things when it's too wide.
But at the outset, if we stop it very carefully, we can save a lot of things.
The habit of smoking cannot be avoided is because of nicotine.
Eating this in childhood affects the growth of the brain.
But today I would like to tell you about a new subject.
You must be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
In a way, e-cigarettes are a variety of electronic substitutions different from normal cigarettes.
When the nicotine substance gets heated in the e-cigarette, a type of chemical smoke is produced.
Like other cigarettes, it is mixed with aromatic chemicals to prevent it from spreading odour.
Even if the father is a chain smoker at home, he has seen that he is trying to stop others from smoking at home and I want children not to have the habit of smoking cigarettes and beedi.
He also wants not to smoke cigarettes at home.
He knows that smoking and tobacco causes a big harm to the body.
But the issue of e-cigarettes is totally different.
People do not know so much about e-cigarettes.
The accident is completely ignorant, so sometimes the e-cigarette gets access to the house, just like it's funny.
If someone smokes around us, you know we can smell it.
Even in his pocket, cigarette packets can smell it.
And so many children and youngsters are proud to be fashionable in the midst of their books, offices, pockets, sometimes walking around with their hands, they are becoming victims of this.
Youth is the future of the country.
The e-cigarette has been prohibited from spreading roots in the society so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our youth, the dreams of our families do not go away, the lives of our children do not go down.
I urge everyone to abandon the misery of tobacco and not misunderstand about e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, right
Fit India is not meant to go to the gym for two hours in the morning and late in the morning.
For Fit India, you have to stay away from it.
Our Bharatamba, our country is a great Vasundhara.
There are many human sacrifices on this earth.
India was a land of extraordinary people like that.
They are self-dedicated for others, not for themselves.
Such a great personality is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians, and on October 13, Pope Francis will proclaim Maryam Thresia as the Holy One.
Sister Maryam Threshya is an example of the work done for the betterment of mankind for 50 years in their narrow lives.
My dear countrymen, India is proud not only of the fact that while we celebrate Gandhi 150, 130 crore people have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
In terms of environmental conservation, India has shown its stride in front of the world, so the entire world's vision is at the heart of India.
I am sure you will also be part of the mass movement to avoid single use plastic on 2nd October.
Everywhere people play their role in this three-dimensional mode in their own way.
But a young man in our country has made a very different move.
When I turned my attention to his actions, I called him and tried to understand and understand his new methodology.
He said it could be useful for the country and the people.
Shri.
It was a new word for me when I first heard the word 'plogging'.
Perhaps this word might have been used in foreign countries.
However, artificial dalvi in India gave it a lot of publicity.
Come, let's talk to him.
130 crore people will take one step in this regard and our India will take 130 crore steps to get rid of the coordinated plastic.
Thank you very much once again.
Many congratulations to you and your team for this new concept.
I'd like to remind you of something in advance.
But it's time for some people to start training and plan for some programmes.
My dear countrymen, by 2022, you will be reminded of me from the Red Fort on 15th August that you must travel to 15 places in India.
Make a plan to stay for at least one night or two nights in at least 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you for the various festivals of India full of diversity.
Yes, yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, you should also keep in mind that fire broke out and people didn't get hurt.
And take precautions.
Together, with enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolve, we can celebrate festivals.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Just a while ago, I had the opportunity to interact with the boys from Karnataka indirectly.
They urged the children to write letters to the Prime Minister of India at a function organized by the Times Group on the occasion of Vijay Karnataka, Children's Day.
And they published the selected letters.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions in the country.
Appreciating Digital India and Smart City projects, Kirti Hegde from the North-East, the child says that we need to change our education system, and that the children of this time don't like classroom reading, they like to know about nature.
If we want to inform the children about nature, it may be of immense benefit in the future to save the environment.
Reda Nadaf, a child from Laxmeshwar, writes, She is proud to be the daughter of a soldier.
What Indian should be proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud of the soldier's daughter too.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that the school is five kilometers away from home, so we have to leave early in the morning and it's too late to return home.
She says she cannot spend time with her friends and she wants to have a school nearby.
But I loved that the press had done it to me, so I could read the letters.
I've had a good experience.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26 November is our Constitution Day.
The Constitution of India adopted the Constitution of India on the same day in 1949.
The Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day to recall the members of the Constitution.
They spent nearly three years building the Constitution of India.
Those who read about this discussion will feel proud of the thoughts of those who were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked to create the Constitution of our country full of diversity
When the country gets rid of the slavery chain, how much discretionary and long-sighted they have expressed
There's no sphere of life that doesn't touch, no matter what nature is.
Equality for all and sympathy for all is the core of our Constitution.
It is our duty to keep the Constitution literally.
Whether it is a citizen or a ruler, we must move forward with the spirit of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be harmed in any way.
In this Constitution, 17 different Committees were constituted based on key issues.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He was a great participant.
On December 6, on the occasion of his birth anniversary, we remember and remember him as usual.
Baba Sahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
On December 15th, the holy day of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel became a steel man from the peasant son of the country and he performed a very extraordinary task of carving a rod in the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constitution.
The Advisory Committees constituted for the welfare of basic rights, fundamental rights, minorities and tribals were also presided over.
Remembering and saluting the brave citizens, police and security personnel who lost their lives.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is taking a terrible form today in every part of the world as a day-to-day event.
We have been suffering a lot in India for the past 40 years due to terrorism.
Thousands of our innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is a challenge to humanism.
This is the land through the message of non-violence and love to the world through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and terrorism are making a cruel attempt to undermine our social relations.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be more conscious of humanity.
My dear countrymen, on December 20, Navi Nam will be celebrating Naval Day.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the rivers.
This country has an unparalleled bond with the oceans.
When we looked at history, 800-900 years ago, during the rice wave, the Cola naval forces were considered the most powerful naval forces.
Their navy played a major role in making them economically super-powerful in the growth of the Cholasam region.
Several examples of coastal naval expeditions and exploration journeys can be seen collectively.
Very few people know that most of the naval forces in the world have allowed women in very late warships.
However, more than 800-900 years ago, women had played a very important role in the cotton navy.
Women even participated in the war.
The corners were well aware of the shipbuilding.
When we talk about the naval forces, who can forget the capabilities he has shown in making the naval forces of the kingdom Shivaji Maharaj.
The Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Jamjira and Swarna Durga related to Shivaji Maharaj were either on the seashore or surrounded by the sea.
Waiting for the safety of these forts was the Maratha Naval Force.
The Maratha Navy had large ships and small boats.
Their navy was capable of attacking any enemy and defending the country from enemies.
How can we not remember Kanhoji Agra when we talk about the Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Naval Force to a new level, and built Maratha Naval bases at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions, be it the liberation movement of Goa or be it the war of India in Pakistan in 1971.
When we talk about the naval forces, the war is in the eye, but the naval forces of India have come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian matters.
The ship Sumitra immediately helped to save the people and handed over many of the fishermen to Bangladesh safely from the sea.
In May-June this year, when there was a major flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our naval forces immediately arrived there and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, when a trading ship was robbed in the Western Gulf, INS Trikand arrived for assistance.
Whether it is for delivering healthcare services to Fuji or for providing immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country during the accident, our navy has been doing proud work and we are always proud of our security forces and honour them.
Whether it is the Army or the Navy or the Air Force, all Indians bow down to the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrificed their youth for the country to live comfortably and peacefully for a hundred and fifty crore people.
Every year on 7th December the Army Flag Day is celebrated.
This is a day of pride and respect for the soldiers of the country.
I am happy that this time, the Ministry of Defence has decided to organize a programme from 1st to 7th December, to reach out to the citizens of the country and to inform people about the Armed Forces and to make people aware.
Children and adults should wear a flag all week.
There must be a movement of respect for the army in the country.
Calling soldiers in schools and colleges, they can learn about the army.
Our new generation can make it a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is for the welfare of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This money is being used by the Soldiers Welfare Board for the rehabilitation of the families of soldiers who have been heroic in the war, for the help of injured soldiers.
Let us also contribute to their well-being.
I would like to say something to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is a great part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the soil alone.
Imagine what will happen if there is no harvest soil in this world.
You're scared when you think.
In our culture, we have thought about it a long time ago, so we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to have devotion and gratitude to the farmland, on the other hand, scientific schemes have been a part of life to keep the soil nutritious.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to soil and maintenance of soil in a scientific manner.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions, and are interested in modern science and are trying to make appropriate decisions.
I have heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorand Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The yield of soil has come down gradually, and the income has come down.
Some farmers of the village have understood the seriousness of this situation and have been advising them to explore their soil in time and give advice on how many chemicals, other vegetation, micro nutrients and organic plants should be provided.
You will be amazed to know what kind of changes have been brought about because of the advice given to you about the health of the soil.
And soil has also increased.
If you want to think about crops, you should first think about the Earth and if you are ready to defend the Mother Earth, the farmers will also feel like waiting for us.
Our farmers have produced more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to illuminate it.
We have devotion to the Mother Earth, but do you think how harmful the chemicals like urea are to the health of the Mother Earth
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that due to excessive use of urea, the epidemiology can be seriously damaged.
Can our farmers and the children of our soil make a decision that by 2022 only half of the urea used in agriculture will be used when it is 75 years of independence
We are beginning to feel global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the winter started before Diwali.
It's now beginning December, the cold is slowly moving.
The 8-year-old unspeakable boy made Visil his weapon.
Wake up at 5:00 in the morning, climbed to the houses of the village, woke up the people and began teaching them not to defecate in the open space.
Kumhari village is free from open defecation due to this child who goes to 30-40 houses every day and teaches about cleanliness.
The youngster Tushar has done a very inspiring job in promoting cleanliness.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are determined, capable and courageous.
In a moment, we get something to learn.
Today they are working well in all spheres.
Whether it is in sports or in any competition or any social activity, our Divyang people are not far behind.
Our divyang sportspersons won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics with a very good performance.
Various types of competitions are being held across the country.
The 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur last day.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this and showcased their skills.
One of them is Giger Thakkar from Gujarat, and 80 percent of his body has no muscles.
He was chosen by the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his skills.
He is one of the 32 para swimmers trained at Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar.
My greetings to Jigar Thakur... and my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangjan can reach any area and there is a special focus on opportunities.
Our endeavour is to make the country capable, to create a society that is inclusive.
After a few days, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born on this day.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all my countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I feel that something can be added and changed to this suggestion.
The elders in our village always say.
Forget the sorrows, don't forget the peace.
Can't you guarantee your role in this
Come, let us share good wishes on the Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on the Social Media at the Positive India (Hastag Positive India).
Let's remember the events that inspire others.
Remembering good things will have a feeling of doing good.
It's the energy to do good things.
Let us see the strength and consequences of this united zeal together.
There's a lot of opportunity to talk about.
PM on 29th October, 2017
Though the sun and water are important in Chhath Puja, the vessels and poultry made of bamboo and mud are essential for the worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture.
The world will respect and worship those born.
But the Chhath Puja culmination gives us a message of worship to the righteous.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also associated with this festival.
Earlier, people used to clean the entire house before the Chhat, as well as join the banks of rivers, lakes, ponds, shrines, shrine cleaning etc.
Sunrise or Chhath Pooja is a celebration of environmental protection, prevention and discipline.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great heritage of India.
You might be happy to know that this kind of business has taken place in a store of Khadi and Handloom.
During Diwali, sale of Khadi Gift Coupons registered an increase of about 680.
The total sale of Khadi and artisans has seen an increase of nearly 90 this year as compared to last year.
It shows that today youth, women and people of all ages like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families, and how many families working in handlooms have benefitted from this.
He says we should also remember our brave security personnel.
We also want to bring home sweets to the Jawans.
I once again got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the brave security personnel deployed on the border.
This time, I had an unforgettable experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are waiting for the country to face the terrible and difficult situations on the border, honouring all the soldiers of our security forces for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
If we get the opportunity, we must listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces are not only on our borders but also playing a very important role in ensuring peace throughout the world.
As Peacekeepers of the United Nations, they are increasing the popularity of Hindustan all over the world.
On 24th October last year, UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone recalls the UNs efforts to restore peace in the world and their active role.
We believe that the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means that the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important UN initiatives since its inception.
India has always given importance to women's equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was initiated in Uttrakhand that all men were born free and equitable, and as a result of the efforts of India's representative, Hamza Mehta, the scripture was acknowledged that all human beings were born free and equitable.
Looks like it's a very simple change, but it's a healthy thought.
Indias biggest contribution under the United Nations Mission is UN Peace Mission.
India has always participated actively in UN peacekeeping missions.
For the first time, many of you know this.
Over 16,000 Indian security forces have served in UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about 7,000 Indian soldiers are associated with UN peacekeeping operations, and India is the third largest in the world.
By August 27, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 missions in 71 UN peacekeeping missions worldwide.
These missions were in many parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labanon and Sudan.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated in hospitals of Indian Army in Congo and South Sudan and have rescued innumerable people.
The security forces of India not only saved the people of different countries, but also took their hearts through public enterprises.
Indian women have also taken the lead in establishing peace.
Many people do not know that India is the first country to send women police forces to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This process of India is a source of inspiration for nations all over the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women's police force.
You will be surprised to know that India's role is not only in the spirit of peace, but also in 85 countries where India is training the peace movement.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha gave a message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to go through remote areas and work.
You'll have to live among different people.
We need to understand and understand different conditions and different cultures.
We need to change ourselves according to the local needs and conditions.
Today, when we remember our brave UN peacekeepers, who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salari
In his memory, all Indians will stand with pride.
In 1989, at the age of seventy-two, he became the Operation Force Commander in Namibia and served the country's Freedom Federation.
General Timmai Cyprus, the head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force and sacrificed everything for peace.
As a peacekeeper, India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony all over the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move forward to create a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, it is our sacred land that was illuminated by the great men who had voluntarily served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagni Nivedita, was one of those unusual people.
Although Margaret Elizabeth Nobel lived in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
The word Nivedita is completely dedicated.
Later, they dedicated themselves to the name and subsequently subordinated the name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They are ready to dedicate their lives to the service of the poor through the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
Sister Nivedita suffered from the atrocities in the British regime.
Not only did the English slave our country, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They continued to strive hard to create an indifferent feeling in our country by showing our culture humiliated.
Bhagni revived the pride of Indian culture.
The revolutionary poetry of the famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati (new lady) is famous for women empowerment.
It is said that inspiration is Bhagni Nivedita.
Shri Jagdish Chandra Bose, a distinguished great scientist, worked in collaboration with him.
They helped spread the research of the boss through articles and conferences.
India's special beauty is that spirituality and science are rich in our culture.
Sister Nivedit and Jagdish Chandra Bose are strong examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague stretched out in Calcutta in 1899.
Sister Nivedit started the drive and road sanitation work without considering his own health.
Sister Nivedita, a lady who had left for serving the poor, despite her comfortable life.
Inspired by their sacrifice, people came forward to cooperate in service matters.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, I extend my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes and heroes of making a New India.
Your concern is that the disease that was previously adults and the disease that had been afflicted by the evening of life has recently started to be seen in children.
It's surprising to hear children suffer from diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are said to be lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for occurrence of such diseases for youngsters is the lack of physical activity i. e.
Societies and families have to focus on this.
If you think about it, you'll see that you don't have to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make small things properly and systematically and make them habituated.
Instead of the children climbing up and down the lift, make the stairs and sleeping habits.
After dinner, try to bring the whole family together and move a little bit.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth India.
I'm practicing it, and I'm saying that a person of any age can easily do it.
It is simple because it cannot be learned and it is possible to do something else.
It doesn't need to be especially equipment or ground.
Several studies are being conducted on how beneficial Yoga is to control diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, not as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I have received good news from the games in recent days.
Our sportspersons have made the country proud in different games.
India won the Asia Cup hockey crown in Hockey.
Our sportspersons played very well, that is why India has been able to become Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India had won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team and the Sports staff who have helped them.
After Hockey, India also heard good news in Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Sreekanth has made the Indians proud by winning the Open Crown for Denmark with the best performance.
After the Indonesia Open and the Australian Open, the Super Series Premier won the Crown.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA U 17 World Cup competitions were held this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills in the football field.
I also had a chance to see a game.
Players and audiences were very excited.
World Cup competitions have been successfully organized and all teams have shown their best performance.
Even if India could not win the crown, the young sportspersons of India had lost their hearts.
The entire world, including India, enjoyed the festival of this game and tournaments were attractive and charming for the lovers of football.
The future of football is bright.
Once again, my best wishes to all sportspersons, all those who have worked with them and all those who have worked with them.
Some send photos of children's missions in this regard, some will be the story of youth's collective endeavor.
A team of non-governmental organizations called the Ecosystem Protection Organisation (Ecosystem Rescue Organisation) came to clean the Chandrapur Fort.
In this two-and-a-half-day long process, people continued to clean up the fort as a team without being tired and tired.
I was amazed to see the picture, I would like to urge those who were disappointed to hear that the surrounding dirt will be disappointed to see that the dream of cleanliness will be realized, and I would like to tell you that you will see the youth of the Electronics Programme Organisation, their sweat, their enthusiasm and their determination in that active picture.
Your disappointment, your faith.
This auspicious effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, co-existence and divinity.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
The feeling of unity and equality in the minds of people by eating together.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to the universal life - conveying the name of the soul, working hard and helping the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev wrote what he had to say.
In the coming year 2019, we will be celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of his message and the lessons he has taught.
My dear countrymen, after two days, on October 31, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he has laid the foundation for modern Akhand Bharat.
We can learn a lot by traveling through the extraordinary life of that great son of India.
His expertise was bringing thoughts into action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the threshold of India's dynamic work.
He asserted that crores of Indians should be brought under the umbrella of a nation, a Constitution.
He was able to overcome all obstacles in his determination.
He set a goal, moved forward and moved towards that goal.
He could do this thing that he should unite the country.
Everyone was an equal nation in his vision.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and inspiring for our vision of New India.
That's why his birthday is being celebrated as the National Unity Day.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of mutually beneficial spirit of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, with a new vision, with a new resolve, all of you will return to everyday life.
My best wishes to the people of the country for their dreams.
The Mann Ki Baat programme, which you have understood through Akashwani, has been completed in three years.
It's 30 to 6th episode today.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can say a little about those who send their thoughts from every corner of the country but I get a lot of treasure.
Mostly inspires me.
A few things are about reforms in government matters.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes it attracts attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember one thing that Acharya Vinoba Bhave had said.
I am sure that after three years, socio-scientists, universities, researchers and media experts will be able to analyze this and bring light on all subjects.
I am sure that this discussion will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future and will get a new energy and new energy.
Mann Ki Baat had said that we should take as much as we need when we eat.
But letters came from all corners of the country, from social organizations, from youth that they are already doing this.
After that, many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Not only in India but also in the world, the Selfida with Doter Programme has become a big drive.
This is not just a problem in the social media.
Every girl has a new self-confidence and a new pride.
All parents started feeling like taking selfies with their own daughters.
All the girls started feeling that they have great significance, importance.
I was discussing with the Union Tourism Department last day...
I told those who leave for tourism that wherever they go, India should connect with me and send a photo.
Millions of photographs, pictures from all corners of India, are in a way a huge treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that the small event is a mass movement.
It's been three years since then, the events of the last three years have appeared in the psychology.
The country is moving ahead in the right direction.
It's a big capital for any country, a powerful force.
I salute the people with my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi said that Khadi is not a dress but an ideology.
Young people see the interest in tail Khadi in the house, in the blankets, in the swords, in the sword, in the curtains.
The sale of Khadi has increased, hence the poor household is connected to direct employment.
The Khadi rebate is given from 2nd October and is very low.
This will give strength to the poor of our country and we will do it.
Increasing interest in Khadi has increased the enthusiasm of the people working in the Khadi sector to think in a new way in taxation for those associated with the Khadi in the taxi and the government.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar-carbons
The ancient heritage has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... to think of how to revive.
A variety of activities have been added to us.
Opportunities for many have been created.
The Khadi Gramodyog Division at Pampore in Kashmir revived its training wing, which has a lot to contribute to the region.
The resumption of this Training Centre will help the new generation to work innovatively, generate new products.
Normal people have started giving Khadi products as gifts to others.
We can feel directly about how an object can be encouraged in a natural way.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
It is said that cleanliness will connect with the minds of people.
Our Honble President began this and the country joined it.
Today, the entire world has become a part of Swachhta drive, that is why the elderly people, men, women, cities and villages should be there.
I thank the Honble President.
People from all walks of life have considered this as their work, all of them are connected with it.
Whether it is a sports or a film industry or academia or academicians or colleges or universities or farmers or workers or government employees or police or soldiers, the service is connected to it.
There has been a change in public spaces that will prevent others from polluting public places, where people working there are beginning to feel a little pressure.
It is heartening to note that in the first four days of the campaign of Swachhata Hi Seva, more than 75 lakh people have joined the work related to more than 40,000 initiatives.
This time we're cleaning one place, and others are careful not to be dirty.
But if cleanliness is a habit, it must become an emotional motivation.
This time, along with Swachhata Hi Seva, a mass movement took place.
More than two and a half million children participated in the Swachhta related essay.
Thousands of children painted colorful pictures.
I do not forget to express my gratitude to the media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They have pursued this popularity with utmost purity.
They joined this in their own way and contributed immensely to creating a progressive environment.
A few days ago, someone had turned my attention towards the work of the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
When you talk about Brandi Ambassador, you will think that he will be a hero in the Sports Sector.
On seeing plastic, polyethylene, utilized bottles and other waste materials, Bilal removes it, thereby generating slightly smaller income.
Bilal's corp ration gave a vehicle, uniform, and he went to other places to teach people the lessons of cleanliness, motivate them, and pursued them until the results were found.
Bilal Dar is a little boy from his age, but he is an inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
I appreciate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of today's history, when it comes to history, it is natural for me to recall the great men.
This month of October is the month of remembering many great men.
We have faced many difficulties for the country, from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who led us and led us in the 21st century.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal Jisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing - live for the country, do something for the country...
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji are far from the corridors of power, but they lived with the people and worked for them...
Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the last man in the society.
Sardar Saheb has united the country.
We have to run for unity and take the unity forward.
Feel the diversity of this India, touch it, feel its fragrance.
You can see that these diversities of our country will act as a great lesson for the development of your personality.
Days of holidays, Deepawali's days... we have the habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourist journeys are natural.
But it is a matter of concern that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of our country, we don't understand, we don't understand, but because of the influence of colourful colours, we are enjoying travel abroad.
The people of West India do not know what is in Eastern India.
Our country is full of diversity
Keep in mind that Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalamji had said that when they were illusioned in India, they got a new inspiration to see, understand India and live and die for them.
These great men travel all over India.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to embrace India.
Can we, as a student, try to understand and understand our diverse states, different societies, people, their livelihoods, their traditions, their dresses, their food habits, their understanding
The value addition to tourism is not just because we see it, but as a student, it is learning and trying to become a part of it.
With my own experience, I would have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of the country.
In more than 450 districts, I have the opportunity to stay at night...
Today, when I take this responsibility in India, I feel very much benefitted from the experiences of those journeys.
I can facilitate understanding of things.
I do not urge you to feel the unity of this vast India's diversity as a signature, but as a treasure of our immense strength.
It has the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food drinks are there
If you eat all your life like this every day, you will never have to repeat.
This is a major strength of our tourism sector.
Not only do you want to go out of the house during these vacations, you don't want to go out for a change, go to know, understand and achieve something.
India covers the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous with these experiences.
The limits of your thoughts will be broad.
Who is a greater guru than an experience
Normally, the time of the journey is from October to March.
People are on their way.
I am sure that if you leave this time, you will take my call forward.
Share your experiences wherever you go, share pictures.
Send a photo on the theme Hash Tag IncredibleIndia.
If you can interfere with people in the place where you go, send them pictures.
Send pictures not only of buildings, but also of natural beauty, but also of people's lives.
Write a good article about the journey.
Send to Mai Gavi, send to Narendra Modi App.
I believe that it will be good for all Indians to know about those seven places or seven things that are the best seven tourist destinations in your state.
If you can, go to the seven places.
Can you give me some information about it
Making films about such good places, making videos, creating publicity and promoting them - the government will accept your findings.
You can also be a source of inspiration to promote tourism from October to March.
I invite you for that.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
I'm a human being like you.
You must have noticed one thing that happened in the past and people have seen a divine example of women power and patriotism.
The extraordinary fact is that the husbands of wealth and treasure are sacrificed by serving Mother India.
Can we imagine what will happen if we don't live in this young age
But Swati Mahadik, the grandson of the sacrificed colonel Anand Mahadik, took a firm resolve in this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
For 11 months, we have been trained well, we have changed our lives to realize the dream of our husband.
His Padni fund took a firm decision and joined the army.
Let us be proud of this mother power and it is natural for all people to feel respected for these brave hearts.
I convey my best wishes to those two sisters.
They are a new inspiration and a new spirit among millions of people of the country.
My best wishes to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our young generation between Navratri festival and Deepawali.
FIFA U-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure there will be soccer rings all around.
Every generation will be interested in Football.
My dear countrymen, this is Navratri.
It's time to worship Durgam Bai.
The atmosphere is full of pure and pure fragrance.
All around there is an atmosphere of spirituality, a festival of devotion.
It is believed to be a festival of power.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, let us move forward by drawing a roadmap for five years to realise the dreams of freedom fighters, the determination of a hundred twenty five crore people, sizeable determination, immense effort and determination.
Thanks a lot.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 27th August, 2017
My dear countrymen, greetings and good wishes.
On the one hand, when the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand it is natural to hear the news of violence from any part of Hindustan.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel, who has spent his life for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and mutual respect, which is a part of our minds.
We have been talking about non-violence since childhood.
I have said from the Red Fort that violence will not be allowed in the name of faith, belief in religion or political belief or belief in traditions.
In the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, there are provisions for justice for every person.
This country will never allow those who take the law, those who carry it in the way of violence, whether individual or society, and no government will allow them.
Everyone will have to bow before the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not confined to food habits, lifestyles or costumes.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Our cultural heritage of millennia old, looking at cultural traditions and social traditions, seeing historical events, there will be no day celebrated in 365 days.
If we look at all our festivals then we can see that there is no festival connected with the time bounds of nature.
Everything is connected to nature.
Many of our festivals are linked to farmers and are directly linked to those who are engaged in fishing.
Today, when I talk about festivals, for the first time, I would like to tell you "Witnesses".
Yesterday, the festival of 'Savasari' was celebrated in the Jain community.
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in the Jain community.
The last day of the Kurukshan celebrations is a day of celebration.
This is really a wonderful legacy.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This is called the festival of 'Kahamavani' and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other by calling it 'Machami Dukadam'.
Our scientific excellence has been described as "sorry brave", meaning "sorry brave".
The forgiving man becomes heroic.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, Forgiveness is the specialty of a strong person.
Shakespeare noted the importance of forgiveness in his drama Merchant of Venice and said, Mercy Essays Blossom, It Blasseet Him That Givs Him That Tax, the forgiving and forgiving person gets the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at every corner of India.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is going on for ten days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
Greetings to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh Festival.
Now it is time to celebrate in Kerala.
One of India's colourful festivals, Honour is the main festival of Kerala.
It is social and cultural.
Onam will showcase the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival offers a message of love and harmony in the society and brings new enthusiasm, new hopes and new faith in the minds of the people.
Now this festival has become a focal point for encouraging tourism.
Navaratri Festival in Gujarat and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become an attractive tourist destination.
Our festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners like this.
Think about what we can do on this subject.
Idul Suha will also be celebrated after a few days.
Besides being a symbol of devotion and faith, we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
A variety of experiments take place in every family.
See how big a change is, how happy a change is going to happen.
As I said, the whole country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm glad to know someone's new invention.
Someone said that an engineer collected some soil and merged it so that he was trained to build a Ganesh viharas.
When a little skin of water pours that skin into the water, it mixes quickly.
He didn't stop so much.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Mission will be launched and it will be 3 years on 2nd October.
Its results have begun to be seen.
Toilets accounted for 39 per cent, which is now 67 per cent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have been declared Open Defecation Free.
Many lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came down, the dirt spread everywhere.
Create an atmosphere of cleanliness across the country.
After constructing toilets, you can add your own name to the portal.
You can write articles in different languages, no age limits.
You can make a short film on your own mobile.
A 2-3 minute long film that inspires cleanliness can be produced.
In any language, it could be a quiet picture.
Please join yourself in this.
You will see how shiny this Gandhi Jayanti day October 2 is.
After this 15-day long waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste-waste.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to clarify a special commitment to you.
I am eagerly waiting for your message than you are eagerly waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
I am waiting with curiosity because every thing you say gives me a chance to learn something.
There's a chance to change what I'm doing.
I am able to imagine a lot of things with a new perspective.
"Prime Minister, I'm talking about denial from Pune.
I went shopping with her in the mall.
She spent two thousand rupees simply for a sari and spent 450 rupees for a pizza.
But he argued with the auto driver for going to the mall for five rupees.
Buying vegetables on the return route, the price saved 4-5 rupees.
I felt very bad.
We don't even ask questions about price in bigger places, but we argue with sisters and sisters dependent on us for a little bit of money.
They're unbelievable.
You must talk about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a great message through this heart-wrenching phone call.
I am sure that my people will leave this habit in the behaviour of the poor.
My dear young friends, on August 29, the nation is celebrating Sports Day.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, the great hockey player, who performed miracles in Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey was stable.
I am saying this because the youth of our country wants to connect with sports.
Sports must be part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves the youngest country in the world, we have to see our children in sports.
Sports is Physical Fitness, National Alertness and Personality Enhancement.
What's more than that
Sports are a great medicine for the unity of mind in a way.
The Sports Talent Survey Portal has been prepared by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to discover talents and empower them.
Any child in the country who has made any achievements in the field of sports can upload his own biodate video.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to select the growing sportspersons.
May you all be happy to know that the Fifteenth World Cup is going to be held in India from October 6 to 18.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home.
The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of those six girls working on the navy is a source of inspiration for all of us.
These six girls left for a small boat called INS Tarini to cross the sea.
It's called Navikka Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months of roaming around the world.
These six children travel bravely among the waves in the ocean for the first time in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
He was the President.
But he himself said he was a teacher.
He was an academic, a diplomat, and he was an exciting teacher in every sense, even though he lived as the President of India.
I bow to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein has said that it is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to Awaken Hoy in creative expression and knowledge that is, the greatest benefit of a teacher is to enjoy creativity and knowledge among his students.
Shouldn't we take a decision when we celebrate Teachers Day this time
Can you make a campaign like a mission
Teach to transform, ducate to mpower, learn to teach and strengthen ease of transformation.
Can we take this mission forward with this determination
Each one should take a pledge for five years, guide oneself to achieve it, and enjoy the success in life after achieving it in five years.
For this, create an environment for our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
In our country, when we talk of transformation, as we remember Mother in our family, teachers in the society will be remembered.
Teachers have an important role to play in transforming them.
It must have been in the lives of all the teachers that have been able to transform ones lives through simplicity.
If we work together, we can play a very big role in transforming the nation.
Let's move on with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Prayer Prime Minister.
My name is Dr. Ananya Status.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Center of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the economic inclusion programme and social programmes related to it.
Would you like to ask that after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana, which started in 2014, India is economically safer and more powerful than it can be said that empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers, villages and ghettos
As a dream in mind, it was launched on 28th August 2014.
Tomorrow, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed by 3 years on 28th August.
30 crore new families have been linked to this bank accounts.
This is more than the total population of many countries of the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested about 60-5,000 crore rupees in banks.
The Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana, Pradhan Mantri SurakshaBimaYojana, has given rise to a new faith in the lives of the poor with a simple preference of one rupee or three rupees.
When the poor person was in danger, the head of the family lost his life, some families got 2 lakh rupees within a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
There are hundreds of examples of how a scheme can transform the lives of an individual, how it fills new energy and how it fills new faith.
They interview such people and inspire the new generation.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to Michami Dukadam.
Thank you very much.
The speciality of the human mind is that the rainy season attracts the mind very much.
Changing climate and environment have adverse conditions.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north-eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, people have suffered a lot due to these years.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to assist the flood affected in their own way.
Social organisations and cultural organisations and citizens working with the spirit of service are doing their best to help people in this environment.
Soldiers, Air Force, NDRF and Paramilitary Forces from the Government of India have been working with commitment to help the flood victims.
People's lives are very upset due to floods.
The NDRF team has been deployed.
Climate warnings are approximately accurate due to the growing technological advancements and the advancements in aerospace.
If the climate indicates that the timelines for our actions are gradually turned into a habit, then we can be saved from major losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are more prepared for it than me.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants Day and I was very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on this day last month.
I am glad to hear that in the north-eastern regions, in the remote mountains, a person living in the forests, I feel scared whether the address was correct or not.
It is observed that the time has come down from one place to another and the busyness of the highways is very low.
Pollution has come down due to the speed of trucks.
Goods are moving fast.
The speed at which this transformation took place simplifiedly, the speed at which it moved from one to another, the new registrations took place, has created a new faith in the entire country.
I am confident that once again the financial experts, management experts and technologists will look at the implementation of GST in India as a model before the world and write a paperwork.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
Because such a massive change has brought us to the throne of victory, with the participation of millions and millions of people, to successfully carry it forward in such a large country.
The world will definitely learn about it.
All the states have a role to play in the implementation of GST and the responsibility of all the states.
All the decisions were taken together by the States and the Central Government.
What a big dream of One Nation- One Tax has been fulfilled.
I can see how the officers from the village to the centre worked with dedication, how comfortable the environment was created between the government and the consumers, how much they had played in enhancing their faith.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the Departments and all the officers of the Union and State Governments in this regard.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is a drive for social reform.
Once again, I offer my heartfelt condolences to millions and millions of people who have made such a big effort to succeed.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of the Revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country was free.
Thus, in August, many events have been associated with the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Bharat Chhodo Andolan.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gathered, tried and suffered with freedom struggle.
The thresholds of history are an inspiration for building a grand India.
The hearts of India united against the British rule.
At the request of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were dedicated to fighting for life with the mantra of "Roff or die".
Millions of youth in the country gave up their studies and gave up their books.
They went out after listening to the sound of freedom.
On 9th August, when Mahatma Gandhi launched the call of Bharat Chhodo, the British ruled over all the great leaders, who were the second generation leader of the country, Dr.
Men like Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan became frontlines.
There was a popularity behind all this victory, peoples talent, peoples resolve, peoples struggle, peoples struggle.
This effort, from 1857 to 1942, reached its peak in 1942.
Within five years, in 1947, the British would have to leave India, with the help of Bharat Chhodo.
I'd like to link you to this math.
We got freedom in 1947.
It's 2017.
For nearly 70 years.
The governments have come.
It was a victory.
Hopes awakened.
As was the crucial year for achieving the resolve from 1942 to 1947.
We have come forward for five years to achieve our goals with determination from 2017 to 2022, and let us celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as an opportunity for our resolve.
May there be crores of decisions.
Let's try to fulfil millions of resolves.
We have to make a decision in that regard.
2017 must be our dream year.
It must be a part of the resolve of the month of August.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die, but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and the body to achieve success.
We have to make a decision that can be achieved in the next five years.
Social discussions can be held on youth associations, students associations, NGOs and NGOs.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we get to be a nation
What can I contribute as a person
With the help of technology, come forward with video, post, blog, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will also launch the uit India uiz for the youth.
This is an attempt to connect the youngsters with the proud history of the country and introduce them to the freedom fighters.
You must give it wide publicity and bring it to the people.
This time too, I invite you to inform your views on the MyGov app or on the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to tell you about it in time as long as I get it on 15th August.
I hope you'll finish it in 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to say one more thing today.
Indias economic system has a socio-economic philosophy.
We don't ever see it cheaper.
Our festivals and festivals are not just an opportunity to enjoy.
Our festivals and festivals are the efforts of social reform.
It connects individuals and society.
Thousands of jobs are associated with this festival, such as Rakhis, Rakhis sellers, sellers of sweets and sellers.
This is why the families of our beloved brothers and sisters live.
We burn the lamps for Deepawali - it is not just a festival of light, it is not just a celebration or decoration of houses.
It is directly linked to the poor families who make earthen lamps.
But today I would like to talk about the festivals and the financial conditions of the poor associated with them and also about the environment.
I believe that people of this country are more aware and more active than ever.
Over the last one month, aware citizens have written to me about the environment.
They have requested that Ganesh Chaturthi should talk about environment friendly Ganesh and people should have the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of Ganesh.
I owe myself to such alert citizens.
This time I'm predicting it.
I'm sure you'll be with me on this.
This will help sculptures and poor artists who will be employed by creating idols.
The poor will fill their stomachs.
Come, let us connect our festivals to the poor, let us connect our festivals to the economic conditions of the poor, let us celebrate the happiness of our festivals for the economic festivals of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, be it the education sector in the country or the economic sector in the country, be it the social sector or the sports sector, we constantly see that the girls of our country are elevating and elevating the country.
We, the people of this country feel proud of our girls.
Our girls showcased the best performance at the Women cricket World Cup last day.
The pressure on their faces, the conflict, appeared.
In that conversation, I reviewed things in another way.
I said, look, there is a lot of hope in the media era.
Whether you win the game or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore people.
The youth of the country, especially our girls, are actually working very hard to enhance the glory of our country.
I once again congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters and my heartiest greetings.
My dear countrymen, I recall the August Revolution, I recall August 9 again and recall August 15 again.
Recalls the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
Resolve all the countrymen, prepare plans for five years for their dreams.
We have to take our country to new heights, bring it to new heights.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
May the future of the country be bright.
The weather is changing.
Weather has become better due to heavy rainfall in many parts of the country.
After the rains, the cold winds have been relieved of the heat in the past.
Whatever the hurdles in life, however stressed in their own lives or in public life, it changes our mentality.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's chariot is being celebrated.
Those who have learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar, must be aware that he praised the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath because they involve social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
A very few people know the word 'Jagernet' in English, which means that no one can stop it.
Looking at the interpretation of this juggernaut, you can see that the word is quoted from the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
We can understand from this how the world has given its own importance to Jagannath's chariot journey.
Everyone celebrated Ramzan's holy month with admiration and devotion.
Now Eid is here.
I extend my best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of holy donation, a month of happiness sharing.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a motivational incident took place in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters who are about 3500 people live in that small village and in a way the brothers and sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population.
During this Ramsan, the villagers decided to build a toilet together.
These 17 lakhs will be spent on other requirements of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mumbai for turning this sacred occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Their every action is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they have made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were declared as such this week.
I express my gratitude to all the five States, to the administration, to the authorities and the general public.
Only then will the habit of body and mind change.
That's how cleanliness is.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
I've noticed something very good about the other day, and I'd like to tell you that.
The Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh is a part of the district.
What was the target
10,000 toilets will be constructed in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, it is a pleasure to know that the ordinary people and the government have successfully completed 10,000 toilets within 100 hours.
71 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In and through the letters, the airways.
Recalling the emergencies of the Emergency, Shri Prakash Tripathy recalled that June 25 was a reminder of the dark period in the history of democracy.
This vigilance of light for democracy is praiseworthy.
Democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
The price of freedom is a constant awareness of the Attendance as the Price of Liberty.
Continuous awareness is required in terms of democracy, and therefore we have to remind ourselves of things that hurt democracy.
And we must move forward towards the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable night for a democratic believer.
In a way, the government was making the country prosperous.
I suppressed the voices of opposition.
In addition to Jaiprakash Narayan, the dignitaries of the country were sent to jail.
The judicial system could not escape the terrible shadow of the emergency.
The newspapers were completely unplanned.
Students from today's press and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people towards democracy, reminding them of the black age.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
In a year after announcing the Emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, which he described in the poem as a mental state of the time.
My dear countrymen, all the Hindustan and the world are proud of it.
The 21st June, 2017 was a worldwide meeting.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the sun rays of the border because of Yoga.
There must be any Hindustani who does not feel proud of it.
Yoga was not preceding, but when it was envisaged with the rod of Yoga, Yoga became a mirror to the world.
Most of the countries in the world have become an opportunity for Yoga Day.
In China, people performed yoga on a massive scale and people from 2400 metres above the sea level were performing yoga on the world heritage site of Peru.
People performed Yoga under the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France.
In a small country like Singapore, this programme was organised at 70 locations and a week long event was organized.
Ten stamps were released on International Day of Yoga in the United Nations.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at the United Nations Headquarters.
This was attended by UN officials and diplomats from all over the world.
This time Yoga has once again created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about fifty five thousand people worked together to create a new world record.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our Armed Forces like BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF are all part of the work with their duty.
Some TV channels have also been published.
Your Excellency, the Prime Minister has recently said in Kerala that instead of giving buffaloes at various places, good books should be a gift to memories.
This was started in your regime in Gujarat but in the recent past, the use of buffaloes is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't we do anything to replace books with bubbles
He said it was Khadi's calculation to encourage Khadi.
As I was in Gujarat, this programme continued, but after leaving, I left that habit.
But I was again involved in this programme in Kerala.
Now, I'm going to give you an information.
Let's make it a habit.
Bucca's life is too short.
You're gonna have to leave after you have your hand.
Welcome to Khadi's Kailash but it is beneficial for many poor families.
Expenditure will be low and it will be useful in the right manner.
It's been many years since the queen of Elizabeth, Kailas given by Mahatma Gandhi has been kept careful.
A variety of letters are available, a variety of people are burning.
While reading a letter last day, I think I'd like to tell you about it.
A familyman from Madurai, Arulmozhi Sharavan, sent me a letter in the south.
You need to know what was in that letter.
In view of the children's studies, I thought about some financial matters and I thought that the family would be able to get some financial help.
I borrowed from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started the work of distributing a few items from the market.
That is, the Government departments will look after the registration of e-GM.
She wrote to me that it's very interesting.
They say, "I got the money under the Mudra Yojana, started the business and added that I can give it to the e-jam, I got orders from the Prime Minister's office and from PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They pointed out what they had bought at the PMO - they bought two thermos and received 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is the opportunity to promote industry.
It has transparency, empowerment, and has a business partnership.
Government e Market Place-Jame.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we can also honour our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is flying not only on Earth but also in the atmosphere.
Two days ago, ISRO-Cartosat-2 launched 30 Nano Satellites along with the Satellite.
These satellites consisted of India and 15 countries including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano Satellite Movement of India will greatly help in agriculture, farming and natural resources.
We must remember that just a few days ago, ISRO JISAT successfully launched 19.
This was one of the largest satellites ever launched by India.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
It can only guess what our scientists have done in the field of environment.
On June 19th, a thousand days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, this mission was aimed at a total of six months.
In recent times, Indias badminton player Kidambi Srikanth has made the country proud by winning the Indonesia Open.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics has got the opportunity to connect with the launch of the synthetic track.
The more we connect with sports, the more we interact with sportsmanship increases.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
Sports has great significance in holistic personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
Children in our families should be encouraged to show interest in sports.
We have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the sustainable environment, all together present a new experience.
Once again I extend my greetings and best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 28th May, 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramsan has begun.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are very important.
Ours is a country that believes in God, denies God, idolaters, and those who oppose idolatry.
We have the art of living together with all the concepts, all kinds of admirations and every kind of traditions.
The message that gives us all religions, castes, ethics and traditions is a harmony of peace and unity.
The holy month of Ramzan will help us move forward on the path of peace and harmony and harmony.
Once again I extend my best wishes.
I am glad that many people have experienced me.
I was enthusiastic to tell myself what you have to say.
I can't read everything, I can't hear everybody's messages.
But I've seen everything together... some have tried to learn music, some have tried to learn a new thread, some are trying to learn new things from the U Tube, some are trying to learn new languages.
I'm glad to hear a phone call.
I'm talking Deepaksha Kathal.
I've just quit reading.
But during these vacations, I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, we realized that how many struggles were made to make India free, how many sacrifices were made and so many freedom fighters had been in jail for years.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has suffered a lot of sacrifices at a young age.
Therefore, I appeal to you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am glad that the new generation wants to know our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, the last great men in prisons did a lot of literary work.
Their gallows gave strength to the freedom struggle of India.
I went to Andaman Nicobar once a year ago.
Cellular went to jail.
This is the birthplace of a hero.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book Mahi Janmathe in prison.
The poems were written in prison walls.
He was locked in a small cell.
A light and sound show is very inspiring.
People from all the states of Hindustan, speaking all languages had dedicated their lives in this Cellular Jail in Andaman with the passing away of 'Kalapani'.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday.
What does it mean to connect with nature
Connecting to nature is to preserve a better planet.
Where is it better than the words of Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, We need to take care of the unvisual world.
Nature has a power.
You must have experienced that when you get tired, if you boil a glass of water on your face, how much energy you have.
When we get tired, if we open the windows of the house and open the doors, we can breathe in the wind that passes through.
When we are in touch with these five pentagons that are built on the body, we have a new energy on our own.
We've experienced all this, but we don't listen to it, it doesn't put it on a root.
Now, when you're in touch with nature, you must be careful whether there's a new chain in you.
Therefore, the global mission to engage with nature on June 5 must be the thrust of each one of us.
We have the advantage of protecting our ancestral environment.
We will also benefit from the future generations if we look after the environment.
It may be recalled that Atharva Veda is the greatest guideline for the environment, which was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth, the son-in-law is called the eternal.
It is said in the Vedas that our erosion is the cause of our planet.
The earth is our mother, and we are our children.
In our country, many festivals, many worshipping rituals are associated with the environment.
Whether it is educated, uneducated, urban or rural or tribal, love for nature is a part of social life.
We have to take it to new words, explain new reasons.
Some extraordinary features from the States are being reported.
Most of the states have a big thriving in terms of vegetation as soon as the rainy season begins.
Millions of trees are planting.
Schoolchildren, social organizations, NGOs and circulators are moving ahead.
This time too, we have to promote tree plantation and contribute to it, my dear countrymen.
June 21st is a special day all over the world.
This day is observed as World Yoga Day.
Within a short span of time, June 21 has reached every corner of the world, connecting people with each other.
On the one hand, many diverse forces in the world take a shape, when India contributes a lot to the world.
Through Yoga, the world is shouting at one stretch.
Today, as the body connects mind, intelligence and soul with each other, Yoga interacts with the world.
Two days ago, I had written to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
Slowly, some steps were taken in this regard.
I have received some suggestions on this and I appreciate those who have sent these suggestions.
Very funny decisive.
Grandpa, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Mother, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Girls, Girls, Girls, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Girls, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Gran
This will be an opportunity to give a new level to Yoga tomorrow and tomorrow.
Tomorrow, this film will be a picture of tomorrow, and it will be a promise of a comfortable tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There's still about three weeks left to be useful.
This is a healthcare scheme in a way.
I invite everyone to be part of it.
When you entrusted me with the responsibility of being a Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at the Red Fort in Delhi, I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been visiting different parts of Hindustan.
What are some people doing to Modi Where is Modi going
I am grateful to him for seeing this.
If you hear the phone call, you'll understand.
Pranam Modiji, I speak Nina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I regularly see people paying special attention to cleanliness in TV and social media.
Whether in Mumbai or in Surat, people have collectively taken up cleanliness as a mission.
Not only adults, but also children are also awake about cleanliness.
The children who are blaming people on the roads can traverse everywhere.
A few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
What's more joyous than what is connected to cleanliness even with my journey
There may be a habit of making all other preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness is a big thing.
It makes everyone happy and inspiring.
"When Modi ji decides the journey, ask the invitees, where will cleanliness be at any level where you invite me
How many tons of gravel will you dedicate to me, and I'll decide whether to come or not.
"The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, we have to become an entrepreneurial venture that will generate so many solid waste material.
How many people can be saved from disease.
What a great humanitarian thing
These wastewaters seem to be wealthy and a resource.
It's not a waste of shit.
If we start seeing these wastewaters as wealthy then new methods of waste management will come forward.
Youth associated with start-ups will also come up with new initiatives and new instruments.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, has decided to set up a massive venture on waste-building energy with the help of people's representatives of cities.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, we are going to provide comprehensive warehouses to collect solid and liquid waste in about 4,000 cities of the country.
There will be two kinds of musks, one green and the other blue.
The kitchen waste, the skin of green vegetables, the food wastes, the eggs and leaves are liquid, and must be placed in green nests.
All this is beneficial in farming and it will be reminded of the fact that farming is rich in fruits and vegetables.
Secondly, unnecessary papers, metallic items, glasses, clothing, plastic, polyethylene, broken dubbed, rubber, etc. are all dry vegetations in a way.
Versova residents are volunteers who have taken over the responsibility.
Brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you something very happy today that the Reizi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become an open defecation free area in connection with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I congratulate all the people of Riyasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last fifteen days, the present government has been conducting calculations everywhere in newspapers, TV channels, social media.
Three years ago, you entrusted me with the responsibility of being a Chief Servant.
Several surveys have been conducted, a lot of polls have been held.
I see these things as healthy things.
This three-year activity has been changed in every way.
It was analyzed by people from all walks of life.
This is a very good way of democracy.
Citizens must be responsible in democracy, governments must calculate their actions.
I would like to thank those who have spoken differently, greatly.
A positive criticism strengthens democracy.
This analysis is very important for a nation that is awakening.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, I feel like the impact of good and bad service on a common citizen.
As I have said, it is important that as a common citizen, I have an impact on my mind.
Two days ago, in Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President ji, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Mahodia and other dignitaries jointly released a book on Mann Ki Baat which, as a person, is a very enthusiastic citizen.
I am grateful to the President and the Vice President and Speaker Mahoda for giving importance to Mann Ki Baat at such a high level.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new status.
Some friends also discussed me in the working of the book on Mankidu Baat.
He said that he would like to sketch out all the topics he talked about in Mann Ki Baat and artistic Akbar Saheb Mann Ki Baat to shower his love without paying a single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, the next time Mann Ki Baat will be told that there will be rains all over the country, the climate will change, the results of the exams will come, the new teaching life will begin... when the rain comes, a new awakening and fragrance will spread.
We can move forward by expressing our love for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on April 30, 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Children's curiosity, the great aspirations of the youth, and the experiences of the adults...
Generally, it's people's nature to advise others.
On the train, if anyone coughs while going to the bus, he's telling me he's close, do it, do it.
Advice, opinion is in our nature.
In the first place, when suggestions were received about Mann Ki Baat, the voice of advice was heard, something was learned, when the team felt that it was a habit for a lot of people that was why they were sending it.
But when we tried to analyze it minutely, it really got nervous.
More than those who say these opinions, and those who try to reach me, actually do something.
They are working according to their intellect, strength, capability and environment to do a good thing.
When I noticed this, I mean, these suggestions are unusual.
Last time I had expressed my anguish over the waste of food in Mann Ki Baat.
This is an example of how things are happening with the cooperation of society.
It's the last day of April.
May 1 is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature has changed all the rules of the game.
The summer of May-June in our country had to be experienced this time in April.
Many people have sent suggestions on what to do during this summer, when people have adopted their missions for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything is public, not new, but it is very useful to reflect on it at the right time.
Many friends starting from Karti are worried about birds.
They said they should put water on the balcony and the terrace.
Small children in the family are very enthusiastic about this.
Once they notice why they have to keep water, they will go ten times a day to see if they have a vessel or if they have water.
You'll see if the birds are coming.
We feel that this is a game, but in fact, it is a good experience for the children to wake up the past.
He lived for 103 years.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra Samaj, through the Burhani Foundation, carried out a massive campaign to save the pimples.
I got the opportunity to start with.
They distributed approximately 50,000 toys to the world.
The Ginnas Book of World Records has got its place.
Often, when the newspaper givers, milkmen, vegetables and postman reach home, they forget to ask if we need water for summer.
Young friends, I would like to tell you something.
Many of our younger generation are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents also grow them safely.
But I would like to tell you how your vacation should be.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes watching things on television, or reading in books, or listening to introducers... and feeling yourself...
May the experiment be positive, let's get out of the hospital a bit.
If we are from a middle class family, we are from a happy family.
You have never had the pleasure of playing in life before.
Have you ever thought how a big change will be brought about in their lives when children who lead such a life in the society get a chance to play with you
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the woods.
Sometimes summer gatherings will be organised, personality development gatherings will take place.
There will be several developmental issues.
Everyone will be busy in their world with the help of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a power.
Another thing I said is about skill, and you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
Anything goes to coaching class during vacations and the next exam is in an anxiety.
But beware that there is no humanity in the inner world, and that it is clear whether it is away from the human qualities.
Can we focus a little more on skill development
Stay away from technology and spend some time with yourself.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words of a new language - Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi...
Try to learn something you don't know, you'll have some benefits.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a curiosity, understand, discuss with people, ask them... and it's a different joy to see there.
Try and settle yourself.
Don't waste time for travel.
Go to a place and spend three to four days there.
Then go somewhere else and stay there for three to four days.
It's gonna learn a lot of things.
Share me where you're going.
Share your experiences using the hashtag incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from silos.
They don't need Rupees.
They have begun to rely on digital transactions.
You can do this too. Do you ever think you can earn money
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
You must have downloaded the Bhim App.
Ten rupees will be invested from the government to your account.
One day, if we get 20 people together, we'll earn 200 rupees by the afternoon.
Businesses and students can earn through this.
The project is scheduled till 14th October.
You have played an important role in building a Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays for vacations and opportunities for financing.
Please introduce digital payments.
Normally in our country there is an atmosphere of hatred for VIP culture.
However, I realized that it is so deep that no matter how big a person is in the country, the government has decided that it will not be able to roam around with a red light on the vehicle.
It was in a way a symbol of VIP culture.
It is understood from the experience that the red light is on the vehicle, but it enters the minds of the people and intelligently becomes a VIP culture.
Now the red light's gone, so no one can claim that the red light on the head has gone.
I got an interesting phone call.
I understand people are worried about red lights.
The government wants to talk about the prohibition of red beacon lights.
I read in the newspaper, every Indian is a VIP in line.
I felt so proud.
Thank you for that.
In return for VIPs, it means that Ever Person is Essential for all.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remind you of our history, our culture, our heritage.
This will give us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 10th birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya by 1. 25 billion Indians.
We've been embraced in other things so that we can only remember it for centuries.
Century is very important for other countries of the world.
He drove away those whom society could not touch by behaviour and behaviour.
Thousands of years ago, he campaigned for their entry into the temple and successfully visited the temple.
How lucky we are for the great men born in our society to ignore the evils of our society in all ages
When we commemorate the birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya, we will inspire the spirit of strength in uniting society.
The Union Government will release a stamp on May 1 to revive the memory of Swami Ramanujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is respected and dedicated to the nation.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, May 1st is another landmark.
Very few people are aware that today we are committed to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect that the workers get.
Baba Sahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramnujacharya, the great Karnataka Sannyasi of the 12th century and social reformer Jagat Guru Basavaeshwar is remembered.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to illuminate his narratives.
In the twelfth century, in the Kannada language, he thought deeply about teaching and teaching.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
It means that you can reach Lord Shiva's original Kailasa through the spirit.
I mean, heaven can be achieved by acting.
I often say "Tajeva Jaite".
I often remember the importance of labour, the founder and thinker of the Indian Masdur Party, Dattapant Tengdiji said.
Today, when we talk about the workers, it is natural to remember Dattopant Thangadi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate the Buddhist festival.
It will be celebrated by people all over the world associated with Lord Buddha.
Ashoka's life in India is an excellent example of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that the United Nations is celebrating Vesak Day on this great mountain of Buddha Purnima.
This time it is going on in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to pay homage to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
There will be an opportunity to renew his memories.
My dear countrymen, an attempt has been made to move forward in India with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas).
Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially in our neighbouring countries.
India-South Asia Satellite Launch on May 5
The capability and connectivity of this satellite will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
Whether it is in the format of natural wealth or in terms of tele-medies or in terms of education or in terms of connectivity to deeper technologies or people-to-people contacts.
This is a great step towards enhancing cooperation with entire South Asia.
An unprecedented gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic battle against injustice is a wonderful victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I extend my greetings to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore's memories are traditional to all of us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore composed the National Anthem of Bangladesh.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was that he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but also gave him the title of the British Nighthood.
However, Rabindranath Tagore is one of the great men who took up the protest during the British massacre in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
It was a deep impact on the mind of a child of only 12 years of age.
The child who smiled at fields and sports in his childhood, Jallian made a new inspiration for the cruel massacre of Valabag.
The 12-year-old child in 1919 is a lovely and inspired by us, Shahid Bhagat Singh.
On 23rd March, the British hanged Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, it was not a matter of joy and joy to serve Bharatmaba in the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three heroes continue to inspire us today.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru with words.
He was afraid of the British Empire.
The prison was closed, the hanging was certain, but the British had the idea of what was more about them.
That's why they killed 23 people who were supposed to be hanged on March 24.
They did it without anybody knowing extraordinary.
Then they brought their bodies to Punjab today and burnt them without any knowledge.
When I got the opportunity to go there a few years ago, I felt a tremor on that land.
I would certainly tell the youth of the country that if you get a chance, you must visit the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
It was the emerging period of independence, its intensity, its propaganda.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
Gandhiji's thoughts and style were reflected in Champaran on India's freedom struggle.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and made the country a new inspiration.
Today, whatever form of Mahatma Gandhi is in our mind, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran on that basis.
A man, who came back to Hindustan in 1915... for just two years...
It was just a beginning.
We can imagine how hard he would have suffered at that time, how hard he would have worked.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to recognise Mahatma Gandhi's organisational strength and the ability to become a public figure in the country.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, organised, inspired and fought for the struggle of the poor and the illiterate in the face of the British Empire...
This magnificent power shows us the Champaran Satyagraha so that we can recognise the magnificence of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha is a subject of great study for any person who starts his public life when he thinks about Gandhiji who had done Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the strong foundation of New India, the desire and efforts of 1. 25 billion people for transformation.
New India is not a government imagination, it is not a democratic party's performance.
The New India is the call of 1. 25 billion people.
This is the imagination that a hundred and fifty crore people want to come together and build a grand India.
There is an idea, an excitement, a vision, a desire.
They're doing things like quiet servants, as penitent as they do.
There are many who go to everyday hospitals and help patients.
There are many who run for blood donation as soon as they know.
If someone is hungry, there are many who think about feeding them.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
The imagination of God is the service of the people in our veins.
If we look at it with social consciousness then how powerful it will be if we look at it.
When we talk about New India, we have to think about it, analyze it and look at a different perspective.
If the 100-25 crore people decide, if the path is determined with determination, if one step after the other then the dream of a New India will be realized in our eyes.
All this is not required by the government through budget, government schemes and government funds.
If all citizens decide that if we decide to abide by the laws of transportation, that they will carry out my duties with due responsibility, all citizens will not use petrol or diesel a day a week...
You can see this dream of New India being realized in this country with 1. 25 billion people.
It means that all citizens should follow their citizenship and follow their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people in our country have been involved in the digital revolution of digital payments and have been curious about how money can be transferred without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and gradually the people are moving towards transactions without money.
After the cancellation of the notice, there have been various methods of digital payments.
It's been two and a half months since the BHIM App, but it's been downloaded by about one and a half million people.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
A hundred and fifty million people don't have to wait for one year if they want.
It's only six months to do.
Let's do this in everyday life.
You are doing a great service to the nation that you cannot imagine and you will be the heroes in the fight against black money and corruption.
Several Digital Fairs were organized to educate the people and to create awareness among the people.
100 programmes will be organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There were presentations.
Twelve and a half million people have received gifts for consumers.
Seventy thousand traders received gifts.
Everyone is determined to move ahead with this method.
On 14th April, Dr.
As decided earlier, on 14th April, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb, we will end this Digital Festival.
We're running a big event when we're a hundred days old.
There's a provision for mega harnessing.
Let us propagate the BHIM App in the days left for Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary.
Please contribute ourselves to reducing the sums of money due to notice.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time Mann Ki Baat comes to people's views, there are many opinions, but the need for cleanliness is rising every time.
The daughter from Dehradun, Gayatri, who studied in the 11th grade, called this message, "Dear Prime Minister, Pranam, my best wishes to you all for the first time in winning this election with great pride.
I want to tell you my Manki Baat.
I want to say that people need to understand how important cleanliness is.
I'm going through a river every day, in which people put a lot of garbage, polluting the river.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain that a child studying in the 11th class is suffering from river pollution.
The child is so angry to see the gravels in the river.
I see this as a good sign.
New awakening has taken place in the country since the launch of the Swachhta campaign.
Hate is also increasing.
Whether it is awakened, active partnership, public awareness... it has a significant significance.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in this Manki Baat today that the message of Gayatri should be a message to all of us.
The things that you see are filled on the plate, you can't eat it all.
It doesn't matter to tell anyone.
Mothers say in our homes when they're praying to the children, son or daughter, take them everywhere.
Secondly, if you can save a little from this, it will be a financial benefit to the family.
It's a good thing to think for society, but it benefits the family.
I don't insist on this thing, but I urge you to get more awake.
I know the youngsters who are doing great work in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for this.
When they find out there's a snack somewhere, they call and collect the food and use it properly.
This is the youth of our country.
Somewhere in all the states of Hindustan, we can see people like this.
Let's inspire them not to leave their lives alone.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way of change.
Those who are cautious about health always say - keep your stomach a little empty and keep the plate a little empty.
When we talk about health, we have to recall April 7, the World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UNHC) has set a target of health for all by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on Depression on World Health Day, April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if we make the meaning of the word, some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression.
When a psychological atmosphere is created, it starts to get rid of.
The first mantra is to say it openly rather than curtail depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers, teachers, what your mind is.
Sometimes loneliness, especially the children in the hostel, will have more trouble.
It is the nature of our country that we have grown together in our family, the big family is interconnected, which reduces the risk of depression.
Otherwise, if you don't get out together, do you think I'm not coming, I'll be alone
Make sure they can speak to him openly to sit with him.
Make smile and motivate him to talk, bring it out if it's hard inside.
It's a good way.
Depression causes physical and mental disorders.
Diabetes, like all kinds of diseases, is depressed, and our ability to fight, fight, dare to make decisions is neglected.
If you cannot open your mind in front of your own people then seek help from someone who is serving closely.
Help with your heart, share your sorrows.
If you try to understand the grief of another person and do it in a spirit of service, a new confidence will emerge within you.
If you are connected to others, if you are helpless and selflessly serving someone, you can also reduce the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is also very helpful in emancipation of tension, reduction of mental stress, and march towards cleanliness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Recently, the Union Government had taken a major decision.
It should be welcomed that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
The responsibility of the family and the participation of the household economic responsibilities have to be done because of this injustice has to be done to the newborn.
Therefore, the central government has taken a major decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April, the festival of Ram Navami is celebrated as Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
May the lives of these great men be inspired, let us have the power to swear for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, the year-long New Year is going to be celebrated, and in this New Year many congratulations to you all.
This is the beginning of the agricultural cultivation after the spring and it is time for the farmers to get the results of their hard work.
This new year is celebrated in many ways in different parts of our country.
The New Year is being celebrated in the name of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as a New Year in Andra and Karnataka, Chedi Chand for Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Sheetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satuwani in Magadha.
India is a country full of diversity.
My best wishes to you all in this new year.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 21st February, 2017
After leafying, new leaves are coming in the trees.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens become green.
The colour of the birds begins to attract the heart.
Not only the flowers, but also the shining fruits of the sun are seen in the branches of the trees.
As a result of the summer, the grapes of manga begin to appear in spring.
The amount of Amir Khusro has been very interesting about the changing moments.
Written by Amir Khusro: Fool Rahee Sarasom Sakal Bun, Amba Faude, Tessu Fulecoil Boley, Dar-Dar-Dar (wheels of flowers, flower pots, flower pots, singing, rocks) When the nature becomes pleasant, the silver enjoys the human being when the silver is comfortable.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri, Holi festivals etc. fill human life with happiness.
Many people don't know the achievements of ISRO by writing on the Narendra Modi App.
So they say they want to know about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Shobha ji, I thank you very much for recalling the pride of India.
Be it fighting poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or getting information, technology and science have marked its role.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to raise the pride of India in front of the world.
We all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the last few years.
After the victory in Mangalyaan on Mars, the ISRO has established a world record in the sky.
ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites from different countries like America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and India.
India is the first country in the world to compose history by bringing 104 satellites into the atmosphere.
It is especially heartening to note that PSLV is being successfully launched for the 38th time.
This is not only the ISRO but also a history of the whole of India.
The cost-effective and efficient environmental mission of ISRO is astonishing all over the world.
The world is openly appreciating the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of the 104 categories is the greatest.
We sent some pictures as soon as our satellite arrived.
It's started its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure that all the leadership of this mission has been done by our young scientists and our women scientists.
The role played by youngsters and women is an important component of ISROs success.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
They have always set their goals in the morning to bring environmental science to the common man, to serve the nation. They are laying new pillars in their crown.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor missile in the security sector.
You will be happy to know that at least four or five countries of the world have achieved this goal.
The scientists of India showcased this.
Its achievement is that even if India's target missile is 2,000 kilometers away, the missile will destroy it in the atmosphere itself.
When we see new technologies, we are happy to see new scientific fields.
The curiosity has played a major role in the development journey of humanity.
Efforts are constantly being made to know Brahmananda, creative laws, human minds.
New science and new technologies emerge from it.
All the technologies and new forms of science give birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, we are talking about the hard work of science and scientists, and I have often said in Mann Ki Baat that our young generation should often increase the passion for science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientists become the cause of a new change in the life of future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "A science is not sufficiently broken from the sky.
All sciences are developed and built on experiences.
Revered Bapu further said, "I inspire the spirit, spirit and dedication that led them in the discovery of the modern scientists following the truth.
"Science seeks to utilise these principles to address the needs of the common people, what media should be, what technology should be, because that is considered to be the greatest contribution of the common people.
Identifying, exhibiting such inventions, giving information to the people, how such inventions can be useful to the common people, how to produce more and how to use its commercial use.
Sometimes the problem itself shows the importance of science in finding peace.
All arrangements are being made in accordance with technology.
In a way, technology becomes an integral part of our lives.
During the last few days, the Digi-Dhan Yojana was very important.
Especially the younger generation is habituated to making digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good luck.
In our country, in the last few days, there has been a lot of support for the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'Diji Dhan Vyapar Yojana'.
For nearly two months, fifteen thousand people get prizes per day.
Through these two schemes, the country has got approval for the launch of Digital Payments into a peoples movement in India.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh subscribers have been awarded each lakh rupees.
More than 4000 traders received an award of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small traders, other professionals, housewives and students are enthusiastic about this and they benefit from it.
Asked whether only young people come or old people come, the awardees include 15 year olds and 65-70 year olds.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore was happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he received a thousand rupees under the 'Lakey Grahak Yojana'.
So I felt that they deserved me a thousand rupees, and I gave them a thousand rupees.
"I am very happy that your name and your deeds give us happiness.
You have done inspiring work for everyone.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Puja Nemade is a Postgraduate student, who shared his own experiences with others about how they use RuPay card e-wallet in the family and how happy they are to use it.
On completion of 100 days of Laki Grahak Yojana, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary.
On 14th April, crores of rupees will be awarded for a grand award.
Forty-five days left.
Can't you do this in memory of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary is over.
Remember him, teach at least 125 people to download BHIM App.
Teach me how the money's cruelty goes, especially the small traders around.
Give special importance to Bhim App for Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti this time.
Go home and bring the Bheem App to 125 crore hands.
This campaign, which has been going on for the past two-three months, has been successful in many townships, in many villages and in many cities.
Farmers in our country have worked hard and produced food grains to break records this year.
All the indications are that our farmers have broken all the records in the past.
Everyday it seems that the harvest of the farms is being celebrated today.
This year, more than 2,200,700,000 tonnes of foodgrains were produced in the country.
The farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and cultivated about 290 lakh hectares of farmland.
The government is constantly trying.
Recently, a function of senior officers of 23 States was organized in Telangana under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's proven.
If a family with a six-divided family has a standard twin toilet, it will be filled in about six years.
After that the waste can be returned to the second hole.
In six to twelve months the dirt in the ditch is completely decomposed.
It is completely safe to handle such degraded waste, which is a very important round of NPK as a fence.
The farmers know the NPK furnace very well.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, which are very nutritious and are considered very fertile in the agriculture sector.
As the government takes this step, others must have taken such steps.
At the government level, several departments regularly observe the Swachhta Diwas.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development, in collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, is going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in the first week of March.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWRD) is collaborating with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation on the second day of March.
We all know that no citizen of our country will be proud of the fact that whatever good he has done, the entire nation will be proud to be at a new height.
I once again congratulate all the team sportspersons.
The nation is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I have always thought Divyang sisters are capable, determined, courageous and imaginative.
In a moment, we get something to learn from them.
Whether it is about sports or aesthetics, women in our country are not far behind.
We are moving forward in a synergy, we are making the country's name brighter by achieving achievements.
Our women have received silver medals in the Asian Ragubi Sevens Trophy in the past few days.
My best wishes to those players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Today it's not just a government program.
People's thinking has changed with the old ethos that have been going on for years.
I am glad to hear the news that the girl was born into a celebration.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls has become a cause of social recognition.
In Gudalur district of Tamil Nadu, child marriages have been stopped due to a special public movement.
So far, about 175 child marriages have been prevented.
Bank accounts have been opened to more than fifty five thousand and sixty thousand girls under the scheme of District Administration Sankunya Samriddhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in the Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all sections have been included in the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme and in addition to organising the Gram Sabhas, the district administration is also making several efforts to strengthen the orphan girls and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized to educate the girl child in every village and every household under the Housing Vision of Harghar Dastak.
Our school, our school, Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, has implemented a scheme to re-school and motivate educated girls to re-school.
In short, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme has taken several forms.
It's a good symptom.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country is enjoying the rainy season, on the other hand there are some kind of festivals or festivals in every corner of India.
It will be like this till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have finished the tactics and the structure of economic and social life in a way that society cannot be narrow in any environment.
In the past, we have celebrated several festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to these problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Despite all these importance, take charge of Sarathi in the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountains, sometimes pick up the leaves you eat.
I mean, it's a new year for Krishna.
So, when I talk to you today, I pay attention to two lovers.
One is a philosopher, a philosopher, a visionary and a charming visionary.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan left the Yamuna coast and dwelled in the city of Dwarka in Gujarat, and Mohen, born on the sea shore, finally reached Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna.
Whether it is the glory of selfless service or the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling at the bottom of all the heights of life, we can learn everything from the message of Lord Krishna.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new pillar of human history has been established.
Service, spirit of service, duty towards service was always a part of his life, always associated with Mahatma Gandhi.
In his own life, he set an example in the way of service.
This was the essence of Mahatma Gandhi's personality, society and humanity.
Be it the Finnix family in Africa or the Tolstoy family or the Sabarmati Ashram or the old age, he always emphasized the need for social combination everywhere in a different way.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to go and bow down to many great places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi gave importance to the organization with the spirit of service.
We have to bring in our practical life the emotions of social service, social growth and social organisation.
In the true sense, this is the paying tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the real engagement.
There must be a lot of opportunities like this, and we'll be together.
But what is Gandhi 150
What can we share in these efforts as a person
Imagine what value addition you can have.
Ladies club.
Let us continue to do things in the modern ladies club, but all the members of the Ladies Club should come together to do something.
We can do a lot of things.
Set up old books, distribute and disseminate information to the poor.
130 crore people will have 130 crore concepts and 130 crore initiatives can be launched.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
During the freedom struggle, the salt festival in Dandi was a great way.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to visit any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaranakam, Ashram of Wardha, and any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures in the social media and inspire others.
This time, in the Indian Pavilion in Venice, Benale, there were many exhibitions showcasing Gandhiji's memories.
Haripura Panels were specially attractive.
You will be reminded that the event of the Congress General Meeting in Haripura, Gujarat and the election of Subhas Chandra Bose as the President of Gujarat has been recorded in history.
These art exhibitions have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Conference of the Congress, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nandlal Bose at Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan in 1937-38.
He wanted the lifestyle of the people of India to be reflected in the Mahasammelan.
In addition to his artistic constitution, Nandalal Bose was also commemorated.
Nandalal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and finally painted some pictures that showcase the life of rural India.
These valuable artworks were a great discussion in Venice.
Once again, I exhort all Indians to make a solemn pledge while conveying my best wishes on the centenary of Gandhiji.
For the country, for the society, for the sake of others, something needs to be done.
This will be a good, real and meaningful businessmanship for Bapu.
My dear brothers and sisters of Mother India, for the past few years, we have been running a programme called Cleanliness for almost two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will begin on 11th September.
This time we have to give special importance to plastic.
On 15th August, I had reminded from the Red Fort that how enthusiastic and enthusiastic hundred and fifty crore people had organised a mass movement to liberate them from open defecation.
Likewise, we have to stop using single-use plastics together.
There is a lot of enthusiasm among all sections of the society in this regard.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have placed a board in front of the shop so that those who come to buy the goods can bring the bag.
It will also help in saving money and ensuring their role in protecting the environment.
This time, on October 2, when we celebrate his 100th birth anniversary, we not only dedicate him to a free India, but also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Let's turn it into fuel.
What's a bigger inspiration than Gandhiji
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit translations are in a way enlightened.
We'll get what we need in our lives.
I would like to say a great deal through a Sanskrit translation.
It's written centuries ago, but even today it's very important.
It is a very nice synonym: Prithvivam Trini Ratnani Jalman and Subhasim Moih Pashanakhandeshu Ratnasanjya Pradhyatya i. e.
Fools say stone is a jewel.
We had great glory in our culture.
We have made science even the knowledge about Anna.
The awareness about the need for nutrition is transforming the country into a mass movement through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and attractive ways.
Accordingly, in the harvesting season, Anganwadi workers are collecting one grinding grain from the people.
This grain is used to make warm food for children and women.
After that, the person becomes self-dedicated to this objective and becomes a fighter of that mass movement.
All of us must have heard about a programme called Annaprasha in every part of India.
It's the first time we're gonna give kids a lunch.
Not liquid, hard food.
People are performing Annadan at various places.
When there is a birthday, auspicious day or a memorable day in the family, the family members take nutritious and tasty meals to Anganwadi or to school and those from their families provide self-service to the children.
Sharing their happiness and sharing others.
There is a good harmony between service and happiness.
Friends, there are many small things like this that can be successfully fought against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of knowledge about nutrition, malnutrition and poor and wealth suffer.
The month of September will be celebrated as a nutritious month across the country.
You must be part of this, add something new, let your share be in it.
It means that if you can save one from malnutrition, we will save ourselves from malnutrition.
In the last weeks, whenever I went, wherever I saw people, man vs.
I have never thought that there will never be a chance to touch the minds of the youth of the world.
What's happening
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since I got the opportunity to go everywhere as the Prime Minister, since then, whenever I have got the opportunity to sit with all those who have the opportunity to observe the International Day of Yoga, somebody has been asking me something about Yoga for 5 to 5 years.
There will be no big leader in the world who has not discussed Yoga with me, and this is my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel is scheduled to be broadcast in 165 countries.
I firmly believe that this episode of Discovery Channel will greatly help in introducing the world about India's message, India's heritage, and the sympathy for nature in India's cultural journey.
Today people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and creative environment in our country.
Have you filmed many times
I ask you very curiously.
Look, there's no secret.
I'll tell you the secret because many of us have this question.
It's no secret.
It is true that technology has been used efficiently in the interaction with Bear Grills.
Whatever I say, its translations continued in English, and he was listening through a small instrument that was not connected to the ear of Bear Grylls.
I mean, he was listening to what I said in Hindi but he was listening to it, so it was easy to talk, this is a wonderful technologies.
After this show many people talked to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You and nature must go to wildlife related places.
I have said this before, I reiterate, I want to go north-east of India.
You have to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, thoughts and anxiety about the environment in India, that is, the idea of conserving nature is naturally visible.
Last month, I got the opportunity to launch the Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
India has 2967 tigers.
A few years ago, it was only half of it.
In the matter of tigers, a summit of Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010.
Concerned over the decline in the number of tigers in the world, it was decided.
It was decided to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, and we are aiming at a faster pace.
We doubled the number of tigers in 2019 itself.
The number of tigers in India has not only doubled the number of protected areas and community reserves.
In the Gir forest, we have taken several steps one after another.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint women guards there.
Infrastructure has been increased to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about conservation.
We must think of sympathy beyond protection.
There are very good advices in our sciences.
Listen to what has been said in our sciences centuries ago, since the inevitable or the wildlife, the wildlife sanctuary has been saved, the forests are barren, i.e. if there is no forest, the tigers are compelled to come and die among humans.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
This Indian young sannyasi, who captured the human race all over the world, has established India's glorious identity in the world.
On September 11, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world responsible for changing his vision towards India.
Come, let us strive to live with the true power of India that Swami Vivekananda saw, the shape of India that Swami Vivekananda saw.
But I don't go into the details.
Wait till August 29.
In order to get rid of plastic, we will strive hard both at home and abroad.
I am confident that this campaign will continue to be full of social media.
Come, with a new enthusiasm, with a new resolve, with a new strength.
Let us move forward by showing the joy inside us with a spirit of service.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 26th January, 2017 at 11.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all.
Our Republic Day, January 26, was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, is a kind of cultural festival that makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, the deeper the widespread discussion, the more the discussions should take place about the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens in our country.
Within two minutes, it reflects social perspective, determination and respect for martyrs.
In our country, the army has a natural respect for the security forces.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do something that is very enthusiastic about social media, especially appealing to the youth
On the one hand, when we heard the celebrations of 26th January with joy and enthusiasm, the heroes of our army, who were guarding the security of the country in Kashmir, were brave news.
I pay my homage to the heroes and bow down to them.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I regularly explain what I have in mind through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are the days of examinations in all families.
When I came to know about this issue, many teachers, parents, students sent me a message, sent questions, sent suggestions, expressed pain and mentioned the suffering.
I would like to share with you my thoughts after seeing them all.
I received a telephone message from a child called Creator.
Listen, the creation says, "Sir, I want to tell you that there is a very scary atmosphere in our home, neighborhood and society at the time of the examination.
That is why children are encouraged rather than being encouraged.
Only a few people who are happy with the exams.
Exams for more and more people are an opportunity of pressure.
That's what happens inside us, that's what comes out.
There is a feeling of strength in society at the time of festivals.
The best shows up.
During the examination, the entire family must create an atmosphere of excitement among friends and neighbors.
You'll see the pressure turning into plashers, and the pressure becomes pleasant.
Encouragement makes the mind unweight.
Look, the change will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, the examinations are scheduled for three to four months.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the most calm mind.
If you're in tension, all the doors are closed, the outside doesn't come in, the inside doesn't come out.
There is a hindrance to the thought process, which becomes a burden.
I am telling you from my experience, if there is a mental pressure, we will forget, if there is peace, then we cannot imagine, it will be very useful.
The problem is you don't know, it's not that you didn't study.
But when your psychological pressure suppresses your wisdom, your knowledge, your learning, your psychological pressure.
Life seems to be a problem.
Your exams will be considered as an exam for the year-long study.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed because of that defeat, if he had failed with his life, India would have got such a great scientist, would he have got such a great President
Therefore, the competition has grown, as well as the stress among students.
Mark and Mark Sheet are of limited use.
That's not everything in life.
Life goes on depending on how much knowledge you have acquired.
If you believe in these things, the mark will shrink after you, and you will never need to follow the mark.
Your knowledge is useful in life, your skills are beneficial, your self-confidence is beneficial and your determination is beneficial.
His experience, knowledge and success are the same.
So the weight of the market stops us from going the right path.
But if you pay attention to the market, you will gradually limit yourself to definite things, just to make a mark.
This is a very psychological battle.
In fact, competition is not useful for leading a life and it is necessary to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How's the day going to be better than last day
How is it better to have a chance to come than what happened
Often you've seen it in the playground, and you'll understand it quickly, so let's give you an example.
It is the uniqueness of their lives that they compete for themselves in terms of most victorious sportspersons.
You didn't sleep because of the stress of the exams before, did you sleep now
Secondly, you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Listen to how you can do better than you've done before.
Beautiful parents have expressed their views on the role played by them.
He said that the role of parents is very important in terms of examination.
Because mothers are more cautious about the future of children in their homes, are relentless, they simplify many things.
If you learn to accept, more problems will end there.
So I have to tell the parents that you're doing this to the children sometimes.
Have you ever thought of giving a smile environment to the children during the exams
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very interesting phone call came.
Because I did something like that in my childhood, and I tried to shit once in my childhood.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find ways, and I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
Whenever we don't believe in our own capabilities, we will examine the neighbourhood that I have written is true.
Perhaps it's right to write a name, it's wrong to write the next guy.
And they're gonna write ourselves wrongly and lose their own pit.
I mean, it doesn't matter much.
It's kind of a liar, so don't.
The shit makes you filthy, so don't get a shit.
"What is the Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of the exam, I will be angry.
It is a common belief that students are careful and careless about learning.
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of the problem.
If there is a comprehensive development, there is a life outside the books, which is very large.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to make life.
It's called maintenance.
In my vision of exams, three things are important, one is the right rest, the second is the sleep for the body, the third is intelligent, and the body has a large part.
So the rest of the body needs a chance to work.
Have you ever thought that when you sit in front of you, you want to go out and see the sky, you want to see trees and trees, you want to make your heart cheerful
Long breath is very helpful to stress.
We don't have to stay in the room for a long breath.
Some think it's late in the night, it's not right.
You must sleep as much as you can for the body.
So you don't lose time to study.
A folksman who came to see me about it asked me, how many hours do you sleep
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said, while addressing the gathering during the election, your loud voice is related to sleep.
If you sleep enough, your vocal code will be relaxed.
He gave me a big medicine that didn't think about sleep, vocal code and my voice.
That doesn't mean it's enough to sleep.
So don't do that.
If you can, follow it, if you can't...
Otherwise, it would be a burden and I would like to advise the parents of your family not to be burdened.
Remembering your own destiny, go to your exams with confidence in your talent.
My best wishes.
Festival of exams to win all exams.
And the exam won't be exams.
Move along with this wizard.
My dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard officers, the Jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard is the 4th largest coastline in the world with 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in our country.
The Coast Guard remains in adverse conditions to protect the maritime shores and sea conditions of the country by ensuring this spirit.
Last year, the Coast Guard had taken up a major objective of cleaning the sea shores of our country with its responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is a matter of commendation that they thought of maritime cleanliness along with coastal security.
Very few people know that not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, but also women and women have successfully discharged their responsibility with their shoulders.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard not only serve as Observers but also control the Howercraft.
Ocean Safety is a very important issue for the world today and hence I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have been working on the great maritime security of India on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard.
Spring Panchami Festival on 1st February.
Spring has been recognized as the best tip.
Spring is known as the King of silver.
There is a festival of Vasant Panchami Saraswati Puja in our country.
This is considered an opportunity to worship tricks.
Not only this, it is also a celebration of inspiration for the heroes.
Mera Range de Basanti Chola is inspiration.
On this auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami, I extend my greetings and good wishes to my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Akashwani also offers new shapes in their own way.
After my Mann Ki Baat last month, Mann Ki Baat has started listening to local languages.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for their self-inspiration and convey my best wishes to the people of our country.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good luck.
Today, in life, it is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus Christ said, 'The poor don't want our benefits, but our recognition.'
St. Luke specially says, "Jesus not only serves the poor, but also appreciates the service of the poor." This is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave them a lot, but the widow gave them all their services today, December 25th.
Two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Banaras, the land of Malaviyaji.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre built there will be very beneficial not only to the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also to the people of Jharkhand Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contributions.
Under his leadership, we have also raised the power of the nation.
As the leader of the party, as a member of the Lok Sabha, as a minister and as a prime minister, Atal ji established a great ideal.
On the occasion of Atal ji's birth anniversary, I salute him and pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Several memories are illuminating.
I shared an old video this morning when I filmed, and I know how I had the privilege of watching Atal ji's affectionate year as a small activist.
Today, in Christmas, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes as a Christmas gift.
In a way, this scheme was launched on November 2nd.
An atmosphere of curiosity is being created around the country, across the country, in the cities, in the educated and illiterate areas of the country as to how cashless payments can be made, how to purchase goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and learn from each other.
To encourage this, to strengthen mobile banking, to become e-payment practice, the Government of India is launching incentive schemes for consumers and small traders today.
This is not only for one day but it will continue for 100 days starting from today.
Every day 15,000 people get a thousand rupees.
You are deserving to be a gift of crores of rupees for millions of families in hundreds of days and you are deserving to be a gift through cashless transactions while using digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, rubber card, UPI and USD.
Digi-Dhan Business Yojana is mainly intended for traders.
This scheme is designed for all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Therefore, those who buy more than Rs. 50 and less than 3000 will receive such gifts.
Those who buy goods worth more than 3000 rupees will not receive this gift.
Feature phones can be used for very poor people with USD, ordinary phones, selling goods, and paying money so that they can be all beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the gift scheme.
I know that all the youngsters of the country will know about these things and if you ask them, they will tell them everything and there will be children in your family who are studying in 10-12 years and they will tell this thing very well.
It's as simple as you send a message on a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, knowledge about how to use technology, how to do e-payment and how to make online payments is being expanded at a rapid pace.
In the last few days, cashless transactions, i. e.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
The business community can very well guess how big this decision is.
The Digital Payments Traders (DGPs) have relaxed the income tax when they promote online payment system instead of a note in their business.
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Someone has said that the Government of Assam has decided to relax 10 percent on digital payment of equity and licensing fees.
The branches of Rural Banks are receiving at least Rs. 50,000 from the Government if they make two digital transactions between January and March with 75 of their clients.
On 31st March, 2017, 100 Digital Transaction villages have been announced to be given an amount of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transactions Scheme from the Government.
They also announced the Digital Krishi Shiromani Yojana for the farmers, which will provide Rs. 5000 to the first 10 farmers who have made digital payments to purchase seeds and fertilizers.
While appreciating the Assam Government in this regard, I congratulate all the governments for such initiatives.
Several organisations have adopted successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
Focused on Fertilizers, GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (GFC) has been set up in 1000 POS machines for the convenience of farmers and 5 lakh chakras have been distributed through digital payments to 30,000 farmers within a few days.
The most interesting thing is that in comparison to last year, there has been a 27 increase in GNFC cultivation.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made great strides in start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies, with new projects, our youth must give a lot of importance to this sector.
So, we can become a partner by taking all our strength in the country's struggle to get rid of corruption and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I ask people to share their views on Manki Baat and tell them what you have to say.
MyGov and NarendraModi App have received thousands of views this time, about 80-90 percent of the fight against corruption and black money.
Some people have explained in detail about the difficulties and inconveniences faced by people.
Another companion wrote that it was so good for the good of the country, however sacred it was, however, all kinds of falsehoods were being committed and how many new paths of belief were found.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
The emotions like Gurumani Kaval appear in every corner of the country.
We all recognize it.
When people suffer, when they suffer, who are the people who don't hurt them
I feel the same pain as you do.
I am obvious that it is impossible for the people to stand by the hundred twenty five crore people, it is the image of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people for taking part in this massive campaign against corruption and black money.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, all must abide by the rules and regulations.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money are trying their best to find out the government's shortcomings.
This government is for the common people.
Continued efforts are being made to know the opinions of the people.
What is the problem of the people, what is the problem due to which law, what is the solution
As an ever-sensitive government, how many laws have to be amended in view of the well-being of the people, the aim is to reduce the suffering of the people.
On the other hand, I had already stated that this was an extraordinary struggle on the eighth day.
For 70 years, how powers have been incorporated in defamation and corruption-free transactions
How much is their strength
When they are determined to fight such people, they also have new ways to defeat the government.
When they adopt new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You're the one I'm going to be ten - because it's decided that corrupt people, liars, cannot be blackmailed.
On the other hand, all kinds of liabilities are being carried out, and all kinds of new methods are found in letters giving other information.
In this regard, I would like to heartily congratulate my dear countrymen.
Many times more information is obtained from the general public than the information available in the government system.
This is because the common people are awake.
Would anyone imagine the dangers faced by the vigilant people of my country to bring such weaknesses to light
They say, "Modiji, don't be weak, don't stop, don't be too hard to walk, if you're out, you need to get to the target."
I would like to especially thank those who have written this letter because they have faith and blessings in their letters.
I took it out and made a strong Benami Property Act.
In the days to come, the law will start working on it.
Whatever you have to do for the good of the nation, for the good of the nation, it will be a priority.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I have said that in the midst of these difficulties, our farmers have broken the records of the previous year on farming.
It is a good fortune for the agriculture sector.
In the last few days, India has made a proud name in many fields in the world economics and as a result of the constant spirit of our people, India's rise in global ranking through different indicators is visible.
Indias rank has risen in the World Banks Doing Business Report.
Indias rank in Top Prospective Host Economics for 2016-18 is third in the Global Investment Report released by Dutch.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and have increased 19 ranks in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank.
This is the way progress is being made even after reviewing several other reports, India is progressing rapidly.
But in this situation, I feel very happy to see some good things happening sometimes.
The government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I personally tried to speed up this movement.
My aim was to get the rights and dignity of Divyang people.
Our divyang brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and beliefs when they won four medals in Paralympics.
They not only raised the pride of the country through that victory but also surprised people by their talent.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are an invaluable wealth and power like every citizen of the country.
I am very happy to note that after passing this law for the betterment of the people with disabilities, I would like to increase the opportunities for Divyangjan to get employment.
The limit for reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
Under this Act, special departments have been created in respect of education, other facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
It may be noted that in the last two years, the government has organised 4,380 shibirs and distributed appliances to 5,500 disabled brothers and sisters who have been disabled at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
The new legislation has been passed by the government in accordance with the will of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyanggar was of seven types.
Thalassemia, Parkinson, Kuldatta, and my young friends
Over the past few weeks, news from sports has made us proud.
It is natural for us to be proud as Indians.
The Indian Cricket Team has made a four-point victory against England.
The game of some young sportspersons was commendable.
Test captain Virat Kohli gave good leadership along with good batting.
Indian cricket team offspring bowler R.
The Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Congratulations to you all for this achievement.
This achievement is good for the Indian Hockey team.
Our ladies were also surprised last month.
The Indian women's hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and now a few days back, India's Mahilahoki team won the Venkala Medal on the 18th Asian Cup.
Friends, I heartily congratulate all the players of Hockey teams.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We were celebrating Diwali in the last month.
Some wrote poetry, some painted pictures, some painted cartoons, some made videos.
I mean, how many houses had turned into military posts.
I am astonished to see how imaginative and visionary I see these letters.
With all your participation, the book is ready by giving you your imagination about the army of the country and your vision for security forces.
A Jawan wrote to me, Majesty, all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali for our soldiers will be held on the border.
Every minute, the thought of the security of the nation lies in the mindset.
However, on the occasion of celebrations, it will be remembered about the house.
But to be honest, it didn't happen this time.
It's a celebration, it's not at home.
It was a feeling that we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army grows 125 crore times.
A few days ago, all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir were also seen.
They were the people of the conference in Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in Kashmir valley.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
However, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order and the future of the children had come to an end.
I am glad that all the village heads from the Kashmir valley have fulfilled the promises made to me completely.
They went to the village and even made people far away aware.
A few days ago, during the board examination, about 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the examination.
There are so many children participating in the board exams that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8:00 pm on 8th November, the Prime Minister said that a grand move to bring about changes in the country has been initiated.
The more important it is, the more important it is, the more important it is to be implemented, I felt that there would be a lot of difficulties in our normal life.
I had said that it would take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision, and I had said that it would be possible to return to normalcy after 50 days.
500-1000 notes, such a large country, so many currency and millions of papers are watching this decision the world over, all the economists are analyzing and evaluating it.
25 billion people of India are trying to overcome the difficulties and succeed.
There may be a question mark in front of the world.
25 billion people of India are very respected.
We believe that this decision will be successful and our country will be transformed into gold.
The responsibility is for the citizens of this place, for you and for you, and for this reason you can traverse to success.
All the components of the local local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank officials, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are in full swing in this regard.
In the midst of a variety of mental conflicts, they are all very quietly regarded as a patriotic mission and are working as an attempt to make a great difference.
Starting in the morning, he works without even knowing when the night is complete.
Despite all this hardship, officials from the bank and the post office work.
When it comes to humanity, they see two steps ahead.
An accident occurred in Khandwa
Suddenly there was a need for money
It was a pleasure to know that when a bank official noticed that he himself went to the house of the deceased and provided enough money for treatment.
Such numerous stories can be traced through daily television, media, newspapers and others.
They are trying to eradicate black money by seducing, tempting the poor and depositing their accounts or doing something else.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, "Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
Tarali of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is from Tarali village of Taluk.
This will give a boost to the people, and the Cashelas economy is very important for nation building.
I'm with this country.
It is heartening to note that you have withdrawn the letters of 500 and thousand.
I would like to thank you in your heart because nobody thought you would make such a big step when you said your father would be a day.
Withdrawing the notes of 500 and thousand, he taught blacksmiths and corrupt people a good lesson.
Not every Indian has a better day.
People from all over the world also learnt to talk about Chai Pe Church.
But I didn't know we were married to Chai Pe Church.
I came to know that there was a marriage with Chai Pe Church in Surat on 17th November.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea to all those who got married.
There were no lunch or diet programs - because of the reversal of the note, the money suffered a bit.
People find the best ways in a difficult situation.
People are finding their own ways.
You see this change.
Those who think no one's going to ask them, they don't pay exactly, their wages will be too much.
If every municipality has 50 percent of the damage.
But this time, on the 8th of this decision, everyone ran away to shut down their old letters.
3,500 crore have been incurred in 47 cities this year.
You would be amazed and happy to hear this, and this week only thirteen thousand crores have been distributed.
There will be many examples of this kind of direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are strong links to the economy of this country.
On the one hand, because of this new change in the economic system, every citizen is compelled to do so in the face of difficulties.
There is considerable progress in lending to them under the MUDRA scheme.
Under the MUDRA scheme, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to such small traders because crores of people are doing these small businesses, they are speeding up the trade of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have difficulty with this decision.
But now our small traders are using technology, mobile app, mobile banking, credit card, and they are serving their customers and businesses are being carried out on the basis of trust.
I would like to tell these small traders that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You can also download the bank's app on mobile phones.
You also have a POS machine to use credit cards.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be used in the entire business of your village.
No one can exploit you.
You, I know, my young friends in my country liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you are very much involved in taking this issue forward in a very useful manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, my best friends.
It is a wonderful opportunity for us to take our country to economic excellence.
My young men, can you help me
Perhaps you don't know the elders, parents, grandparents, grandparents or grandparents in your family.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is.
It's a common thing for you, you use it.
But today the country wants to do a great thing of a society that is not observed.
It is true that a hundred percent of the society cannot be noticed.
But can't we become a little noticed society
Once you start a slightly slightly surrounding society, the unsighted social structure will not be far away.
You know what opportunities are there for a society that is not noticeable, digital banking or mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facility.
All Indian banks have mobile apps.
All banks have their own walts.
Valette means e-pers.
Various types of cards are available.
As part of the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
The utilization of a very small RuPay card has increased by 300 times since the eighth date.
Like prepaid cards on mobile phones, prepaid cards are available to spend money from the bank.
Not only this, technology is simplifying the need for a big smart phone.
I emphasized the need to further simplify these arrangements.
All banks are trying to do that.
My young friends, despite all this, there's a great generation that doesn't know anything.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I see your creative messages on the Watts App - printing, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations, funny games.
But, my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this.
Your mobile phones will have technologies for online expenses.
Not only this, teach us how to use this technology and how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money on your account, how to provide it to the borrower.
Once you teach people how to use RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
Perhaps they will get rid of all worries if they teach ordinary people all this.
I don't think it will take long for all the youth of India to take up this issue.
Within a month, we can present a new India in front of the world.
You can do this on your mobile phone, go to ten houses a day, and connect ten houses a day with it.
I invite you, come on, not only support, but we can become a force of this change, we need to relax.
We will take this war to the forefront of corruption and corruption in the country.
That country made a revolution.
My dear young friends, once again I urge you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSS to do this thing together.
Let's take this forward.
We have the opportunity to serve the nation well.
You shouldn't miss this opportunity.
You must have seen that the most famous artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Yojana, is moving forward very heartily.
Cleanliness seems to be spreading in his veins, which reminded him of his father's birth anniversary and cleanliness.
He has written a composition of a poem by Harivansh Rai ji: "I am a soft body, a joyful mind, a comfortable life.
"Mitti Kaa Man, Masti Kaa Man and Kshan Mana) His son, Shri Amitabh ji's nerves are swelling like blood.
He has written to me through the poems of Harivansh Rai ji: 'I am a clean body, a clean mind, a clean India.
I respectfully bow to Shri Harivansh Rai ji.
Thank you very much to all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and happiness in every corner of India.
India is a country celebrating 365 days in any corner of the country.
We have seen the courage to stop unprecedented festivals.
The changes in festivals have been naturally adopted as per the needs of time and society.
Do it through festivals.
Our ancestors have linked these things with festivals in a very scientific manner.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether it is trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, it is a festival that is responsible for all.
It means that even the holidays in our country were celebrated with brahmanda and science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I have said, our festival also provides information and knowledge.
This Deepawali Tamaso gives a message from Jyotirgamia to the light from darkness.
Cleans all parts of the house.
We have to enlarge this behaviour and tradition and enlarge it.
Deepawali is no longer confined to India's border.
Deepawali is remembered and celebrated in one way or another in all the countries of the world.
Many governments and parliamentarians from all over the world are participating in the Diwali celebrations.
The festival of Deepawali will be celebrated in the eastern countries, in the west, in the developing country, in Africa or in Ireland.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali has been shared in the film.
During the Diwali celebrations in London, the British Prime Minister organised a gathering of greetings, connecting all communities.
What's in that painting...
The Prime Minister of Australia, along with the Deepawali greetings to the Indian community, has urged the people of different cities of Australia to join the Diwali celebrations.
The Prime Minister of New ealand visited New ealand last day.
He said he needs to return to Deepawali soon.
This festival of light, Deepawali, is indicative of the fact that the festival of light is becoming a catalyst for bringing the world from darkness to light.
Parents have to ask parents to stay closer to the elderly when the children break their lumps, keep in mind that there is no obstacle in the mind and avoid danger.
In our country, the festival of Deepawali will be a little longer.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
Whether I talk about Deepawali or about the Chhath Puja, it is indeed an opportunity to convey my best wishes to all of you.
But it is also an opportunity to express gratitude to the people of the country.
Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives for our peace and peace due to the events that have taken place in the past few months.
When we all celebrate Deepavali, our soldiers suffer all kinds of hardships, some in the desert, some in the Himalayas, some waiting for industrialists, some waiting for airports...
How many responsibilities do you have
In words, birds, swords, colors, imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I am happy and smiling because of you, I say the truth that because of my freedom and the gift of happiness, I sleep peacefully, because you have the mountain, the sky and the India that becomes India, I salute you, as I salute the Century.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani, who is full of the houses of her parents and the houses of her husband, gave me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am talking about Shivani Mohammad.
Our army brothers and sisters get a lot of encouragement by launching this messaging to Diwali.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
The Border Officers get very encouraging messages and encourages everyone in the Army Circle.
Along with Army Officers and Solgiers, their families and their wives sacrifice a lot.
In a way, I convey my best wishes to the armed forces.
My dear countrymen, we can see that the soldiers are not only on the border but also in every sphere of life.
Our soldiers are working nationally in every sphere of their lives... in case of natural disasters, in the face of the law, in the face of conflict with the enemy, in the face of daring to bring back the misguided youth.
It was Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will do so on 1st November.
The name of his village is Badhan.
He was there and there was a discussion about the construction of toilets.
Some families found that due to financial hardships, toilets could not be constructed.
Vikas Thakur worked and gave 57 families a thousand rupees in their own pockets to achieve Swachhata Abhiyan.
This has enabled Himachal Pradesh to become Open Defence Free.
In the jungles, far away from Kerala, there is no way to reach the wolf.
People don't go there.
It has been decided that all the select stakeholders of Cadet, National Service Scheme and Engineering Students will jointly construct toilets there.
In all the states, things are progressing at a fast pace.
Only a few things I've taken.
I sincerely appreciate the citizens of these States for their role in reducing the blindness caused by dirt from all over the country as part of this great achievement.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government will be very much, after the first project, if such a second such project comes, we will have to abandon the first project.
Normally, no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us.
You decide according to this criteria.
We have to face the awakening hopes of the poor of the country, which is the need of the hour.
Now there are girls and toilets in schools and boys have toilets.
It is no longer possible to remain the 21st century and remain blind in the village.
Therefore, the programme of electrifying the village from darkness is progressing successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide a smoke-free life to 5 crore households.
Small merchants, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk sellers, merchants etc. were caught by the gangsters.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand Up Scheme, Jan Dhan Account etc. are successful programmes for the release of Prisoners.
Deposit to Aadhar-Loude Bank
This is an opportunity for ordinary people to get rid of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who dedicated his life to the unity of India.
31st October is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the birth anniversary of the dynamic Mahapurush of the unity of the country
I think he succeeded in it and he united everyone together.
We can say that on the same day, Indira Gandhi will be assassinated and her destiny is opposite to the nation.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of that great man who lived for unity, the cruelty of Sardar Saheb and Sardar Saheb is a source of pain for us in history.
Stay away from the thoughts of other seas, from the actions of other seas and from the country.
Sardar Saheb's journey of life started in the fight for the farmers.
He was a farmer's son.
Sardar Saheb played an important role in bringing the freedom struggle to the farmers.
Now sometimes we're listening to his name.
Even today, people from outside India are familiar with all the products of Atal, but very few people know that Sardar Saheb's divine vision is about the cooperative Milk Producers Union.
He gave importance to this thought in 1942.
We have clearly seen how it was based on the comfort and prosperity of the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with pride.
On this Ekta Diwas, wherever we may be on October 31, we must remember Sardar Saheb and understand the vision of unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartika Purnima is a glimpse of this festival of Deepawali and it is a festival of light.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev is a guide not only for Hindustan but for the entire human race.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty, good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev made Bhai Laloo his colleague when there was a lot of distortions, casteism and simplicity here.
If we want to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', who will be better guided than Guru Nanak Dev
Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of this festival.
My dear countrymen, once again on the occasion of Diwali, I extend my warm greetings to all of you on the occasion of Diwali.
May your dreams and imaginations succeed in all things.
May your life be comfortable and peaceful.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 29th September, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
In the past, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these heroes and pay tributes to them.
The loss was lost to the son, the brother lost, not only those families who lost their husband.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We have pride in our army.
Parents and politicians have a lot of opportunities to talk.
All parents want all schools and colleges to be fully functional.
The farmers want their crops, fruits and vegetables to be marketed all over India.
I mean, I want to do the right thing in the economic business.
Over the past few days, business has been going well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, the path of progress and the path of development.
We have to scale new heights of expansion for our future generations.
I am sure that we will find peace in all the problems together and will prove the right path for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the parents of Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government will have to take certain steps to maintain the law and order.
I would like to tell the security forces that our forces of strength and laws are used for the peace of the people of Kashmir and for the peaceful and peaceful life of the people of Kashmir, they should be properly maintained by our security forces.
Sometimes those who think differently than we think, give new opinions.
In recent times, I have got a lot of opportunity to learn from social media.
From every corner of India, people get an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of all kinds of people, which encourages the strength of democracy.
On the last day, a child named Harshavardhan of class 11 presented a different idea to me.
He wrote, "After the terror attack in Uri, I felt sorry I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do... what a little boy like me can do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative vision.
But during the 1965 war, Lal Bahadur was a scientist who led us, and there was an excitement, fury, the fence of patriotism.
Everybody wanted to do something and thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried very hard to touch this emotional level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the common people of the country how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Scientist showed that all the stars had other ways to show patriotism in the midst of the noise of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi led the struggle for freedom, when the struggle took place, when it seemed necessary for the struggle to take a step forward, there was a very effective way to bring that power back to creative things in the society.
Let us and the armies assume their responsibility, let the administrators define their duties, let us patriots, let all the stars play a constructive role in the spirit of this patriotism, the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Karthik Narendra Modi wrote to me the App, the alternates that went to participate in the Paralympics wrote history, their performance was the victory of the Human Spirit.
Not only you two, the paralyzed participants in the Paralympics in all of the country have embraced an emotional relationship with our players.
Perhaps more Para Olympics has changed the achievements of our sportspersons and the vision of humanity to the divine.
I will not forget the words of our victorious sister Dipa Malik.
When she won the medal, the sister said, I have defeated the disability through this medal.
There's a lot of strength in these words.
This time, 19 lates, including three women from our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, Divyangjans sports have a greater desire and determination than physical skills and sporting skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have achieved 4 medals with the biggest achievement so far - two gold, one silver and one bronze, the second gold medal in the Paul Volt.
He lost his hand due to electric shock.
Imagine how a man would have served the second gold medal at the age of thirty-third and then at the age of thirty three.
Mariappan Thankavelu won the gold medal at the High Jump.
Tanquelu lost his right when he was only five years old.
Poverty did not interfere with his determination.
He's not a big city, not a middle class family.
Whether it leads a life full of suffering or physical distress, it has won medals for the nation through determination.
If it is Lat Divamalik, it has rocked many victories.
Varun C.
He won the Bronze Medal at the Bhati Hayjam.
It is also important that in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood we are inspired to look at the divyang brothers and sisters.
We must awaken our sympathy and also change our vision for this Divyangjan, and very few people know that this time the paralysis has shown a lot of performance.
A few days ago, the Olympics contest took place at the same place.
Is it possible for anyone to think that even the people with disabilities have broken the records of the General Olympics
And this time too.
In the days to come, India is trying to make an ease of doing business for the Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
And I told the people I was there, and people were surprised.
I had the opportunity to release a book, in which some of the success stories of the lives of Divyangjans were collected.
There were very enthusiastic events.
I believe that the establishment of World Record on the soil of Navasari by the Government of India is a great thing.
Within 8 hours, six hundred persons with disabilities were able to listen to machines.
I got a place in the Ginnas Book of World Records.
It means that the country has taken a hundred and fifty five crore steps towards cleanliness.
We have been able to see how well the result is moving in the right direction and what is happening through a little effort.
Whether it is the road or the bus stand or the railway or the school or college or the establishment of religion or the hospital or the children or the elderly, the poor villages and the farmers and the women all play their role in Swachhata.
Friends from the media also played a constructive role.
In order to make healthy, respect for parents, especially for mothers and sisters, we must end the shell of curtains in the open space.
Therefore, the Open Defence Free (ODF) has started a mass movement called the Open Defecation Free.
A healthy competition is being held between States and States and districts.
The States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will soon be able to achieve success in the path of liberation from the practice of open defecation.
Come on, let's move with determination.
I would especially like to present a scheme to the young friends who are using technology in the recent past.
Everyone has the right to know what is peaceful in your city in terms of cleanliness, for which the Indians have given a number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you call this number in 1969, you will not only understand the conditions for the construction of toilets but also apply for the construction of toilets.
You're going to benefit from it.
Not only this, a Swachhta App has been launched to know about Swachhta related complaints and the solutions to those complaints.
You take advantage of this, especially the new generation.
The Indians have requested the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
In today's era, health is linked to sanitation, as it requires a model of sanitation.
It must be part of the waste to wealth.
So, with the Swachh Mission, we must turn to the West to Compost.
Fertilizer has told the companies to get ready to buy compost from waste.
The Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to have a serious discussion about cleanliness and cleanliness.
What can we do with technology
How can we get jobs through this
Discussions will be held on subjects such as:
I see new news about cleanliness.
I was told that students from Gujarat Technological University went to 107 villages and made awareness campaigns for the construction of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, from Devprayag to Gangasagar, propagated a 2800-kilometer Swachhta message.
Every department of the Government of India has prepared a timetable for a year.
I urge the stars to join these departments in their respective activities without any hesitation.
All about cleanliness is happening recently.
Initially, the survey of 73 cities was carried out and the level of cleanliness was presented to the people.
Now there are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
This time we are lagging behind, next time we will have a confidence in every city that we will do a little better.
The coming October 2 is the birthday of the Mahatma and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission started.
Deepawali's lamp will also be illuminated in the house of the poor this time on October 2nd, Sunday.
Wouldn't you be able to participate in the elimination of waste in a parameter for 2 hours, 4 hours
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
Joe of Giving Wheels are going to be celebrated in different cities from 2nd to 8th October in collaboration with the CEOs.
It is aimed at delivering food, clothing to the needy.
Today is the centenary year of that Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
Antyodaya theory is his contribution to the common man.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor benefit from development
Let us focus on how the poor can achieve the goal of development of the society, the governments and all.
It is a symbol of the year of poor welfare and I salute the great Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was an inspiration for all of us, who was rich in our natural heritage.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat on the occasion of Vijay Dashami two years ago.
I have sincerely tried not to be a part of the Mann Ki Baat government's actions.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a program of political tactics and accusations.
How does the common man in this country inspire me
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not a debate 15-20 minutes ago but a new opportunity for social transformation.
Anyone else will be more happy than this.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 27th August, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, Tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey wizard Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played an important role in winning the gold medal in Hockey in the Olympic Games in 1928 and 1932.
Everyone we love cricket has heard of Bradman's name.
He mentioned about Dhyan Chand as Hi Scores Golse Like Ranges.
Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once upon a time in Kolkata, a opponent hit Dhyanchand's head with a hockeystok.
So there was 10 minutes left to finish the game.
In that 10 minutes, Dhyanchand dumped three goals and said he had responded with the goals.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, there are several opinions on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
Full of diversity.
But this time everybody wants me to say something about the Rio Olympics.
I am very optimistic that the common citizens are so close to the Olympics and so waking up and asking the Prime Minister of India to say something about it.
There is so much love and awareness among the citizens of India regarding sports without cricket.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are not behind anyone in any way.
It seems that girls from all over India have taken up the mission of making India proud.
Shikhar Thakur wrote in MyGov that we could do better than the Olympics.
He wrote, "First wishes for our two medals in Admiral Modisar, Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents are focusing on studies and academic issues today.
The society still considers sports to lose time.
This thinking needs to be changed.
We need to enhance the spirit of society.
Nobody can do this better than you.
We can't deny that we can't perform a demonstration like we hoped.
In some cases, our sportspersons showed great performance in India, but they didn't expect good performance here.
We have only two medals in the medal list.
But if you don't get a medal, you can see that in many ways our films show a good exhibition.
You see, in our shooting, Abhinav Bindraji reached the fourth position and lost his medal at a very small difference.
That's what happened in Tennis about the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopen.
We performed well in the athletics.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, the simple Babar has qualified for the Track and Field Finals.
It is also heartening to note that after 36 years, the female Hockey team arrived at the Olympics.
In the last 36 years, the first male has reached Knockout Stage in Hockey.
Our team is very strong.
Many sportspersons, for example, Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal and Anu Das.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we do as we have done, perhaps we'll be disappointed again.
We'll prepare a framework on how we can be better.
The scheme is to be formulated with a far-reaching approach to 2020, 2024, 2028.
What can we do in the field of sports, what can we do for each of our states, what can we do for each state to create such committees
States should select one or two of their own instruments which can be empowered.
I also urge the Sports Associations to conduct an analysis with neutrality.
I appeal to every citizen of India to send me an opinion on what is interested in, on Narendra Modi App.
We're fully prepared.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers Day for many years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from the little children.
For me, the 5th September was Teachers' Day and the Teachers' Day.
But this time, I want to attend the G-20 Summit, so I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
Teacher has as much place as mother has in her life.
I have seen teachers who are more concerned about their own people than themselves.
They dedicate their lives to their disciples, to their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, we hear about Pulla Gopichand.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, I salute Pulla Gopichand, his dedication to his penance and sports, his way of enjoying the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
On 5th September, the former President of India, Dr.
The nation is celebrating the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnanji, the Prime Minister said.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today, he seems to teach me in the classroom.
Maybe he's still giving me a Currency Correspondence Correspondence.
It will be astonishing to see his handwriting at the age of nineteen and write so beautiful letters at this age.
My letters are very bad and if I see someone's good letters, I feel very respectable.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh Festival is approaching.
The Ganesh changes the divisions... let there be no division in the lives of our country, of our society, of our family, of all of us.
Lokmanya Tilak started the Ganesh Festival, making this religious festival an occasion to awaken the nation.
Even today, the Ganesh festival is being celebrated not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
Every youngster will be very enthusiastic and ready for this festival.
Some people are still trying to embrace any kind of emotion that the philanthropist has taken forward.
Discussions are held on public issues, articles are held, flower festivals are held.
In its vision, the topics touching society are presented in a artistic manner.
In a way, the Ganesh Festival is a major drive for public education.
Lokmanya Tilak has inspired Swadesh to be our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
The festival provides a new life to the lives of individuals and society.
Life is impossible without a festival, but it has to be shaped in time.
This time many people have specially written to me about the Ganesh festival and the Durga Puja.
You can use Ganesh ji made of mud in the village pond.
Statues made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
He and many others have suffered a lot.
I also urge you to build statues of Ganesh and Durgadevi and return to our ancient heritage.
Ganesh is a disintegrator.
So we shouldn't make Ganesh, who makes him dissolved.
I don't know how much you're going to accept, but it's not what I say, many say.
Many such institutions are working hard to build and propagate a mud-covered Ganesh.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
If we make the river in the lake with a bear, it will be merged again and there will be no harm to the environment.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will proclaim Mother Teresa on 4th September.
Mother Teresa spent her entire life serving the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud that Mother Theresa, who has served the poor throughout his life, is being given the status of a holy person.
The Government of India is sending an official delegation under the leadership of our Minister of External Affairs, Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore people at the celebration of 4th September.
We can learn something from the sages, the sages, the sages, the sages and the great men.
We keep earning, learning and doing something nice.
My dear countrymen, when development is a peoples movement, how much change will be there.
Democracy is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganges and connect people with the five state governments in collaboration with them.
On 20th of this month, a meeting of the village heads of the banks of the Ganges was held in Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for taking this idea forward.
I express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers and the five States on the great pledge to clean the Ganga by harnessing the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my heart and I am particularly honoured to those people who have created these ideas.
On 15th July, more than 1 lakh students from more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote to their parents.
Some have written in English, some have written in Hindi, some have written in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents in that letter that they need toilet-toilets in their homes.
They asked me to make toilets, although some people didn't celebrate their birthday this year.
This is what inspires us.
A 16-year-old girl from the Kopal district of Karnataka, Lamma, committed a swearing-in against her family.
The family was not financially capable.
The kid stood firm.
The village chief, Mohammad Shafi, who knew that he was pursuing a Satyagraha for the Malma Swachchalaya, arranged for Rs.
The strength of the girl Malama and the village chief like Mohammad Shafi are commendable.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have aimed at it.
This information will be available on the web site.
The awards will be given to the winners on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I want to tell the TV channels that you should also urge you to make a film like this and compete.
The creativity and waste generation will be strengthened, new seals will be obtained, new methods will be known, new motivations will be given.
All this will be done by people and ordinary artists, whether a big studio or a big camera is required to make a film.
Everyone may feel that the President will inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
We have Bangladesh on our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal still exist with the same cultural heritage.
Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Betar will share their programmes and people from both sides will enjoy Akashwani's programmes.
Akashwani's contribution in building personal relations is very big.
The President inaugurated it.
I also thank Bangladesh for their cooperation with us in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their contributions abroad.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of becoming Prime Minister, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart more.
Such emotional events provide new energy and inspire, which inspires the people of India to do something.
My heartfelt condolences to millions of mothers of India who have struggled hard to help others.
My dear countrymen, we have suffered due to deficiency last year, but this month of August has become difficult due to continuous rains.
There have been floods in some parts of the country again.
State governments, central governments, local institutions, social institutions and citizens have made a lot of effort to do whatever they can.
But I heard some other news in the news about the flood, which I had to remember more.
The month of August this year will remind us of the strength of unity and how big a change can be brought about if we move forward together.
In August 2016, the parties, who have been holding strong political turmoil, have unanimously passed the GST Act, almost 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament together.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big a thing can be achieved if all the parties move together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties in the country spoke together about the developments in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the strength of 125 crore people.
This morning I had the opportunity to spend with some young people of Delhi.
I believe that in the days to come, all the youth of the country will be immersed in the zeal of playing Olympics.
The whole world will be in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons everywhere.
I will surely send messages to sportspersons on your website Narendra Modi App.
Come, let us all together try to enhance the dignity and dignity of all our actors and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion of talking to you about Rio Olympics, you can hear a poem from a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash, who is interested in poetry.
There will be other poets like this, they must have written such poems, some may have written, some may have written, some may have composed music of poems.
I would like to share the poem that Suraj sent me with you.
Mr. Angid Karke, a young man, remembered me on the anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, it has been inspired by Mr. Angie to write down what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be guided by technology.
If anybody tries to capture it, it will appear somewhere far away in new dresses, and if we want to take technology together, we must move ahead.
Therefore, we can adopt research and innovation as technologies.
Innovation, periment, entrepreneurship etc.
If we organize the next generation innovation, our children will join it.
That is why the Government of India has started the Atal Tinkering Abbs.
The programme will provide assistance of Rs. 10 lakh to the schools and another Rs. 10 lakh for the next five years.
Likewise, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
In order to build self-sufficient incubation centres, we can create a systematic mechanism for start-ups to conduct experiments for innovation.
Construction of new incubation centres and upgradation of old age is essential.
We have to face many problems in our daily lives.
If you get sick, you want to recover quickly, so you eat something antibiotic.
You may be free for a while, but you must stop taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
As long as the doctor doesn't write, we don't eat antibiotics.
We don't have to travel through such foxes.
Years will pass on this war, new medicines, scientific exploration, etc.
Until then, these diseases continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we must always be aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills, the doctor will tell you to eat it in five days.
Finish the course by taking pills as many days as the doctor suggests.
Even if you take more medicine than required it will be beneficial to the germs .
So, for how many days the doctor suggests, it's a big thing to follow.
In medical terms it's called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow the rules to use them as the use of antibiotics.
Our government is committed to protecting antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red line on the top of it, which has provided information about the antibiotics sold today.
My request is that you take care of it.
I would like to add another topic to health.
I am worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
It cannot be said that during and after pregnancy, blood deficiency, congenital infections, high blood pressure and when such difficulties destroy their lives.
In view of these things, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan in the last few months.
As part of this mission, all pregnant women on 9th and 9th of every month are provided free access to government healthcare facilities.
I would primarily urge the geniologists that one day in a month, i.e., the ninth day of the month, cannot provide a free service for the poor mothers.
I'm sure you will be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
There are socio-economic discussions about this in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
Kurukshetra is discussing the trees of Lord Krishna in the battlefield.
It has also been stated that there is no medicinal plant or medicinal herbs, which is inadequate to breed.
The tree offers a tree to the donor, like his own treasures, in the entire world.
So parents, who wish for their own good, have to plant good trees and protect them like champions.
Whether it is Geeta or Shukracharya or the Discipline Mountain of Mahabharata, there are some people who live in these ideals on their own.
A few days ago, I noticed a daughter from Pune, Sonal.
It touched my mind.
The Mahabharata Discipline says that the tree is fulfilling the responsibilities of the martyrs all over the world, and Sonal has taken a mission to fulfil not only his parents but also the desires of the society.
His grandfather Sonal was married to Kisan Ghandu Mahatra of Narayanpur village in Kejunar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra in a very inspiring manner.
I saw the picture in social media.
I didn't see the bridegroom at the wedding, but rather the plants were merely visible.
It was a picture that touches the mind.
Sonal is an agrarian graduate and this idea is hers.
You will see how much nature has expressed its love through the gifts of Mavindai to those who have come to the wedding.
In other words, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal legend of nature and I extend my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatrajee for this new endeavour.
This can be transformed into a natural manifestation of tree-bearing.
I am told that on 1st July this year, the Government of Maharashtra has decided to plant about one and a half crore trees across the state and plant three crore trees next year.
It is not simple to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan will understand how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat has a brilliant legacy of the Forest Festival.
This year, we have pledged to plant millions of trees by offering a wildlife festivities to various names like Gujarat Maav forest, Ekta forest, Martyrdom Forest and others.
But for me, South Africa was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela while talking about South Africa.
When we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoeni Settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I had the privilege of traveling by train from Pierter Maritburg station on the journey of Mahatma Gandhi, and this was the event that enabled a Mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi.
I would also like to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great men who have laid down their lives for equality and equality in society throughout their youth.
They fought shoulder-to-shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-22 years in prisons with him and thus regained their youthfulness.
I am fortunate to see the great friends of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Kathara, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Besos and Ronnie Casirils.
Even after such a great penance, there was no imagination of gaining, acquitting and becoming.
I have seen in them a manifestation of the duties stated in Geeta.
No society and government have any illustrious mantra of equality and equal opportunity.
Their thoughts are very natural.
They told me about an incident, a sculpture from Bangalore.
A woman was cheated in a chit mail and slapped 11 lakhs, and then I read the news of her suicide in an article.
As a woman, I feel sorry for her family.
I'd like to know what you think about Cheat Fraud Mail.
Within a few minutes, I realized he's gone.
You must have been misunderstood sometimes.
They're gonna be so nice.
But I had a very pleasant experience in this neighborhood.
A few students from Aligarh came to me.
The boys and girls were very excited.
They came in as a great album and enjoyed their faces.
I have done artistic paintings at the station.
Not only this, they have collected plastic bottles and oil utensils in rural areas and planted sand and constructed virtual gardens.
And on one side of the railway station, this vertical garden has been built in plastic bottles and given a new impression.
My dear countrymen, the times of festivals have come in our country for years.
Just imagine, why don't you give a sister a gift that protects her life Not only this, there will be women who cook food in our house.
There must be a woman who cleanses our house and she'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born in the post-Independence era.
I was the first Prime Minister to be born in the post-independence period.
May the entire nation be filled with the spirit of freedom fighters, let us spread the humility of freedom once again.
Let's all create this atmosphere.
And the Independence Day celebrations should not be a government programme but a programme for the people of the country.
We have to celebrate our own like Diwali.
I would like you to do some good thing in your patriotism, including inspiring patriotism.
Definitely send its pictures to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an atmosphere of its own in the country.
You might want to present that thing in your heart with the same fervor from the Red Fort.
As your delegate, I invite you, if I want to tell you this thing from the Red Fort as your main servant, as your delegate.
I do not want the Prime Minister to be the Prime Ministers words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is easier for you to get things to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for introducing Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8 PM.
Several of these suggestions are helping my government's actions.
Perhaps it's a week to start the rainy season, so our anxiety is also coming.
Almost all parts of the country are experiencing scorching heat of summer.
Climate change enhances such problems.
Trees have been cut down.
In a way, human beings destroy nature and destroy themselves.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Discussions about environment are taking place around the world.
In the last few days, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Himalayan valleys have become volcanic.
I have got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of 11 states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha who have been suffering from heat wave in the past.
I listened carefully to every country.
Normally, there has been no such subtle discussion about how much the central government has given and how much it costs.
The fact that water conservation, environment, drought degradation, animal husbandry and drought-hit areas in a way, showed excellent work for the entire nation was also an architect of the Government of India.
I told the NITI Aayog that by adopting good models from them, we should take steps to implement them in other states.
Some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have been fully harnessed by technology.
Now I would like to bring the successful experiments of the States to other areas through NITI Aayog.
In such cases, public participation is a major pillar of success.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive plan, we can make significant changes in the time limit by using appropriate technologies.
Irrigation is also important.
Their target is to add 2 to 3 lakh hectares of land per annum to micro-irrigation.
Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan is being implemented in Chhattisgarh.
Approximately 22,000 ponds have been added to the Madhya Pradesh Balram Talab Yojana, which is not a small measure.
They were aiming at water conservation and in some states small microbes were constructed and 10 and 20 kilometers of water conservation projects were implemented.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that no drop of rain water will be lost by June, July, August and September.
We have to think about what should be the place for water conservation.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We'll be careless when we see a lot of water and when it's rainy season, we'll be worried without water.
In the recent past, the media was talking about the problems of water availability.
I am confident that the media will provide water conservation guidance and expand its operations and the media will also participate in the ways to address water scarcity.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
We need to create a transparent India.
Our plans have to be unearthed in every corner of India.
We have to make little changes in our old attitudes.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world looks like a cashless society.
Electronic technology can send and handle money from anywhere in the world.
When we're together, we'll be able to move forward as a wealthy society.
You might have seen that RPA CARD has been provided with the Jan Dhan account.
The Credit Debit Card will be utilized in the coming days.
No need for money or counting or anything from the pocket.
This is the Bank on Mobile - the Universal Payment Interface Banking Transaction - PI that will transform the systems in a sustainable manner.
Your mobile phone will make Money Transaction very easy to pay.
Perhaps, if this is easily possible, RPA CARDs don't always have to take along.
In addition, the post offices have also been made active for banking services.
Illegal transactions will last forever.
The impact of black money will be very low.
So, my countrymen, I wish - let's start this.
Once we start, we can move very easily.
Maybe somebody had thought about this 10 years ago that we'd have such a mobile phone.
So let's become a society without money.
It would be better if it happens without a footprint.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when the Olympics contest comes or when the game starts, we will be far behind in the gold medal.
If we get silver.
Each one must encourage and encourage our sportspersons to participate in the Rio Olympics.
Over the last week, we were all worried about the results of elections, especially in Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons and encouraging our sportspersons, such things give a lot of courage and strength to everyone.
India has to place its mark in front of the world with the sportsman spirit, not everybody in the roots of the world.
Throughout the year, the results of students studying in 10th and 12th classes are being followed one by one.
I want to tell those who have not been able to win, there is a lot to do in life.
A Mister of Madhya Pradesh...
Gharib Patel presented a great deal of trouble to me.
33 percent of the market was not happy.
Everyone was telling me I lost 90 percent of the 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt like putting a load on my mind.
I read your letter carefully.
I think, perhaps, this pain is not yours.
Like you, there are millions and millions of students, because there is an atmosphere like this.
Can we lead society towards peace and satisfaction by finding satisfaction in all matters
Your relatives, colleagues and friends are 89.
I have written Anand Giri Goswami from Jodhpur about the same issue.
He says people in my neighborhood don't accept our results.
If I had been a little better - I don't remember all the poems, but I wrote a poet I read a long time ago, and I painted a painful picture in the canvas of life.
Some said it would be better if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if you were there instead of putting this record here.
Well, it would have been better if one or two of us had seen a picture of my pain.
Everyone's talking about the tape.
Like you, millions of students are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I'd like to tell you that you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses the need.
Stay firm on your feet and try to fill a little more beautifully.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new goal can never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is the foundation of great success.
The unsatisfaction derived from victory is not the threshold of success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of Santoor's instrument.
There was a time when Sandur Vadodara was associated with folk music in the Kashmir valley.
But Pandit Shiv Kumar ji had taken it into his hands and made it the greatest instrument of the world.
Shehnai - Our music was in a very limited place all over the world.
Most of them were found in the darbars of the kings at its gate.
But when Ustad Bismulakhan was handed over to Shehna, it became a worldwide instrument.
It is true that the cost is very low for not being sick, but if the disease occurs then the cost of recovering health is very high.
If anyone can help the poor, it's only for cleanliness.
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
All over the world, there has been a special belief in Yoga, respect and faith.
Yoga provides the strength to lead a balanced life to the world that is stressed.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes or 30 minutes in his lifestyle.
For this, we inspire on 21st June, Yoga Day.
Sometimes a social atmosphere becomes the reason for bringing about changes in the life of a person.
I hope you will take the lead wherever you are on June 21.
If you are required in your neighbourhoods, in your cities, in your villages, in your schools, in your institutions, even in your office.
Start for a month from now, and look, you'll be part of it on June 21.
I'm going to attend Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, I have been continuously connecting with you through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
I've given you a mobile number a long time ago and you could hear the Mann Ki Baat by calling a Mrs.
But it's made even more simpler.
You just need four hours to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you call Missed in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to you.
Don't forget the water I told you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time when both of you and I are waiting.
This time too many letters, commands, phone calls have been received, so many stories, suggestions, inspirations...
People were discussing books on science, technology, new inventions, history, culture, business, life history, etc.
People asked me to discuss other books.
But I don't have to say I can't take time to read a lot of books.
Let us start a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App and write and discuss it whenever we read a new book.
You can propose a name for this book corner.
I want this book corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Many experts have made good efforts in the field of water conservation.
People share knowledge about traditional methods.
For example, the spirit of rural water conservation in the village Aara Karam in Ormanji Block, a little away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an exemplary example for all.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India, Meghalaya has become an independent state of water.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, very little water is required, but farmers are being given importance for unpolluted farming.
I specially appreciate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers and motivating them to move from conventional farming to cultivate less water.
Now it's time for festivals.
Festivals are also held during the festivals.
You can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
A message of water conservation can be delivered in these fairs in a very good manner, exhibitions, street plays, festivals and message of water conservation can be delivered very quietly.
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
Especially the achievements of children and their actions give us new energy.
So I want to talk about some kids.
They are Nidhi Baip, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Prithvi Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguli, Hrithik Alamda.
I will talk about them and fill your hearts with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word "cancer" is very frightening in the world.
It's a champion who won medals after winning the game.
But it was a rare opportunity for them to become champions before participating in the competition.
That's the champions of life struggle.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
It means that in their lives, those who have fought against cancer, in this competition, competitions like shooting, chess, swimming, race and football have taken place.
All these champions of our country have won medals in the tournament.
Some of these sportspersons received more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of India's victory in the sky beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata and P.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country to achieve this goal.
On July 22, the country was proud to move from Chandrayaan 2 to Sriharikota into the atmosphere.
The launch of Chandrayaan 2 has filled the people with pride, enthusiasm and happiness.
The Chandrayaan 2 mission is unique in many ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But it must always be remembered that we have the ability to survive.
I have great hope that Chandrayaan 2 will inspire the youth of the country to turn to the world of science and innovation.
Finally, science is opening the path of development.
On the surface of the moon, we are awaiting an immortality of the time when Lander Vikram and Rover Pragya landed.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with the students and friends of the country the information about a very attractive competition with the youth.
I would like to invite the youngsters of the country to a quiz competition and the curiosity related to space, Indias science mission and scientific technologies will be a key issue of concern.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this issue and make it attractive and enjoyable and unforgettable through your partnership.
I specially urge all teachers and schools to try their best to make their school successful.
Encourage all schools to participate in this.
This will be a historic event in their lives for students who are victorious.
But we have to participate in this issue, get the maximum mark, become a winner.
Inspire more and more friends.
Dear friends, you must have noticed something.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhata Abhiyan has accelerated from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of over bridges and schools to the huts, people joined them, it became a big step.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a major role in this regard.
We need to develop the culture of wealth from waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, the last day I read a very attractive message on MyGov.
This commander belonged to Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: "It is a pleasure to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I participated actively in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility Programme in my state Jammu Kashmir.
This event was organized in June.
I believe that such programmes must be held every three months.
The programme should also be monitored online.
How illiterate and enthusiastic are the people of Kashmir to join the mainstream of development
For the first time in this programme, big officers came directly to the villages and the unavailable officers of the village had come to their houses to understand the hurdles in the development and to solve the problems.
I was busy with how to increase the income of the people.
He said that the service of the administrators has a great impact on the lives of ordinary citizens, and the rural people have opened their minds and raised their concerns.
Discussions were held on subjects such as literacy, male ratio, health, waste management, water conservation, electricity, water, girls education and issues of senior citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a government function like the officer travelling in the village all day long, but this time the administrators spent two days and one night in Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added a lot of things to make this event even more attractive.
Khelo India led a sports competition for children.
Sports Kit, Job Cards of National Employment Guarantee Scheme, ST and ST certificates were distributed there.
This kind of programmes and the participation of the people are being called upon that our brother-in-law of Kashmir, Saddam, would like to understand that the power of progress is above the strength of bombs and guns.
It is evident that those who want to hatred on the path of development cannot achieve their immense goals if they want to obstruct them.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre, the winner of the Gyanpeeth Award, spoke in his poem about the glory of the month of Shravan.
In that, he said, "Hodige Madige Agyedu, the sovereign land of Magna is different from the ties between the prey and the current of rain, and the earth is immersed in its beauty.
Throughout the year, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the Shravan month in their own ways.
In this climate, when we look around, the earth looks green.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, many fast regularly and eagerly wait for enthusiasm like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
Rakshabandhan Festival is a symbol of the affection of sisters and sisters.
Speaking about the audience, more than 4 years of devotees participated in the Amarnath Yatra this time.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days in 2015, more than those who took part in this journey were only 28 days this time.
I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their spirituality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
The people who return from the journey have changed the zeal of the people of the state and the idea of their own.
All these are very helpful for the pilgrimage in the future.
On the other hand, this is the time of heavy rainfall in many parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no dearth of festivals in our country.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country that enjoys economic prosperity through festivals.
Festivals turn into opportunities for economic security for the poor of the society.
You know I use technology very well, so I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Savesh Warker wrote to me that this session was a tourist conference.
There are many national and foreign tourists coming here.
People also celebrate Christmas holiday.
Often we hear things disappointing in different corners of the country.
It is the strength of the nation that millions of people do something good in their own way, just like the Tajikistan.
Regular opportunities for education and employment are being created.
When the whole world was attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Day of Yoga, we believed in the strength of India and were proud.
This imagination is reflected in the larger vision of India.
The word Swachhata is heard in the houses today.
The people's participation in it is increasing.
That's a service route too.
I've made a little effort in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear young friends, the start-up India and Stand-Up India have started a preliminary discussion on August 15 at the Red Fort.
Thereafter, it was discussed in the government departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
New start-ups and new inventions, whether in the manufacturing sector, in the services sector or in the agriculture sector, were discussed so as to provide a great opportunity to the youth in the states.
If you think so, it's wrong.
Youngsters from any corner of India should give them an opportunity to be talented.
Start-up India and Stand-Up India should not be shrinked in just a few cities.
It should spread to every corner of India.
I urge the state governments to expand this.
On January 16, I will discuss this with clarity.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear youngsters, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me who are inspiring from Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is celebrating 12th January as the National Youth Festival.
It is being celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January this year.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, you can see the pimple of dreams.
The power of decisions can be seen.
Can you share your suggestions on this Youth Festival with me
I think this is the result of your initiatives.
Sir, thank you for a thousand.
You're a person working in this field
So you can understand that you have suffered a lot.
Sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, so many words.
Every word has its own greatness.
This year, the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take it.
Have we started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
This will facilitate the development of all types of infrastructure and bring them to smoothness.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, ramps of railway stations, parking, lifts, braille scripts, they need innovation to facilitate them.
Technologies are needed, system requires sensitivity.
The effort is already on, the people's participation is on.
People are enjoying it.
The files shouldn't be stored before that.
In fact, plans are for the common people and the Dalits.
In the past, the Government of India conducted an inquiry into how to benefit the right owners of the schemes.
Subsidy is provided to gas cylinders in our country.
It wasn't checked to keep track of the calculations.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this regard.
Integration of Aadhaar Card is a mission to provide subsidies to the beneficiary's bank account through the world's largest director Benefit Transfer Scheme through Jan Dhan Account.
I am proud to say that the world's most successful director, Benefit Transfer Scheme, has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On the one hand, Aadhaar Card Campine on the other, Jan Dhan Account on the other, and on the other, the Central State Governments have been working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link them with bank accounts through Aadhaar.
Money is now directly credited to the workers' accounts at various places.
There were complaints about the scholarship of the students and efforts have been made to solve them.
Approximately 40 crore rupees have been directly transferred to beneficiaries accounts through various schemes.
Approximately 30-45 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the India Republic.
In the Parliament, two days have been laid down for a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
Most of us are aware of the duties at the time of election and we are convinced by advertisements and wallwritings that voting is our duty.
Why don't we talk about duties and duties in our daily lives as in the election time
Can we hold discussions in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organisations on the basis of duties in view of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar in a modest way on January 26
125 crore people stepped one after the other and fulfilled their duties, it would be an unprecedented history.
Let's start the discussions.
You might have got a chance to go somewhere.
Festivals have a great significance in social life.
News of natural disasters is usually coming from every corner of the world.
We've never thought or imagined these evils.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
The central government is working with them with their shoulders.
But in the face of such misery around, we have to think about the need for changes.
That's a good beginning.
Today, I received a message from Jalandhar in Punjab, from Lakhvindar Singh, from Jalantar district of Punjab.
"I was very happy to hear your question, Lakhvinder Singh.
I am happy that you are cultivating organic farming.
Not only that, with organic farming, you understand the problems of the farmers very well.
But it's not right to think it's just going on in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of all Indians, we follow the traditionally burning ruins of harvest.
First of all, we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Secondly, I didn't train how to do this.
But your concern is true.
But these aren't real.
The ruins of the crop are precious.
Secondly, the surface of the Earth shrinks with fire.
We can't survive even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, the earth burns not only the ruins but also the skin of the mother.
Animals can also be utilized for their food, which also saves our land.
Not only that, put the foam on the same planet right there, it makes double profits.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who are cultivating bananas.
They shared their best experiences.
Hector had to spend five thousand, ten thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand to remove the waste after harvesting.
That's how the ruins of the banana will remain until the people who want to change them bring the tractor.
However, some agriculturists buried the ruins of the banana into pieces up to 6-8 inches.
Last time I had talked about donations in Mann Ki Baat.
He also spoke about the helpline of 'Chathacha' for organ donation.
The film star, including Ravina Tundon, also participated in the function.
Organ donation can save many precious lives.
In a way, organ donation provides immortality.
When the organ is transplanted from one body to another, that organ gets a new life.
What's more important than this
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation for patients awaiting organ transplantation was launched on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every constituency and in the true sense the best possible help for the needy.
Everyone has to move forward for this.
As I have mentioned earlier, we are celebrating 3rd December as International Disability Day.
Physically and psychologically disabled are the owners of unparalleled will and courage.
They feel sad when they're ridiculed.
We'll start crying when it's a little harder.
When we think of how they live, our pain looks so simple.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of life, their zeal to transform the challenges into capabilities are commendable.
Today, I would like to talk about Javed Ahmad.
He is 40, 42 years old.
The terrorists shot him in Kashmir in 1996.
Though he was a victim of militant guns, he was amazingly saved.
But one of his kidneys was ruined, lost a part of the intestine.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He lost his ability to stand on his own feet forever, but he didn't give up.
The wound of extremism did not defeat him.
How to revise physically handicapped appliances, how to make arrangements in public places and government offices
Is Javed's life capable of inspiring every corner of India
I specially recall his dedication to the life of Javed Ahmad on December 3.
Because of lack of time, I am just talking about Javed but this kind of inspirational lamps are emerging at every corner of India.
Our country is big.
There's a lot of things that depend on the government.
More than one experience changes our perspective of government practices throughout life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people are working around us like this.
If you see the sick with love, what's more happy than that
Are they participating in the sorrows of the society
I congratulate all the architects of India working in such a way on the name of 'Jamunami'.
While discussing 'e' books more, one of the young people should tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes in nearby schools, what is happening here, what is happening there.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to you all for nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change.
A friend who guided me to share this uncomfortable experience had sent me an ink to know and see.
However, one thing they did wouldn't seem to have been thought of by others of such education.
They have been working with solar energy to provide light to the poor in their area.
They fought against darkness and made their name oblivious.
They built a plant of solar lit by a combination of women.
They are paying homage to local residents on a rent of just a hundred rupees per month.
We know what big people in the world are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much for the e-News.
But the beginning is very good.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have been provided 40,000 crore rupees (Rs 42,000 crore) through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it be a laundry labourer or a journalist or a nursing labourer, it will be really beneficial for any labourer.
Abhishek shared his happiness too.
There's a lot of things coming in front of me.
The other is from Mumbai to Shailesh Bhosla.
8. 5 lakh (8.
During our Swachh Bharat programme, I had said that this scheme is a new entrepreneurship.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing this to work.
But nobody knows enough about this plan.
How should the programme be fashioned
How do you want the logo
But I'm expecting more suggestions.
Very basic projects are required.
It will also provide an honour to the active participants.
Moreover, other awards have also been announced.
My dear brothers, the winter months are starting.
Everybody should come together to make a festival by creating a good atmosphere in the family.
Through the exercise festival, you will be able to realise how much the brilliance of chaitanya can be.
The body will be more active all day.
If there's a good weather, it's a good habit.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you once again.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of presenting Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Man Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can say that this thinking of our ancestors has great strength and truth because I realized it.
Several topics have come from the bottom to the government.
And, it is true that the basic principle of governance is that information should come down from the bottom to the top.
Did anybody ever think that Mann Ki Baat would be this source of knowledge
But it happened.
So Mann Ki Baat gave us a chance to show the strength of the community.
The whole world was amazed when I said selfie with daughter one day.
It was a silent revolution.
People from every nook and corner of India have sent lakhs of pictures.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have not thought that we have so much wealth.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform and people took up the job without spending even a rupee for the government.
I was happy to mention Gandhiji at my first Mann Ki Baat programme in October last year.
Referring to Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, by encouraging and encouraging Khadi products across the country.
There was a time called Khadi for the nation.
Why don't you make it Khadi for fashion now according to the change of time
I want you to buy Khadi to the people, I wanted to do something.
I am happy to say that after that Khadi sales have almost doubled.
It didn't happen with government advertisements.
This has not been achieved by lakhs and crores of rupees.
An experience of manpower, a victory.
Once I said in Mann Ki Baathi, the poor man's house smokes wood, the children cry.
Shouldn't they get a gas cylinder
Today, I can say with great pleasure that 30 lakh families in our country have abandoned subsidies of LPG.
I saw a retired school teacher in the channel standing in ueen to abandon the widow's subsidies.
It is difficult for middle class and lower class to give up subsidy.
But such people have abandoned subsidies.
Isn't this a quiet revolution
We can't see people's power in this.
Whatever happens within the framework of our government, governments must have a larger populist, powerful and determined society outside this framework.
What else is there to enjoy
This time I thought of conducting a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
There will be no place in India where people dont have phone calls.
That's a comfortable experience.
People of all ages have sent messages.
I wanted to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is taking action for the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Sometimes it seems we're indiscriminate.
But my experience is different.
These fifty thousand people said their own way.
How many more creative people of the country think about it, how big is it for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls from the background of serious complaints.
It was a matter of happiness that more than 90 per cent of the total energy emitted.
They must be listening to the radio.
He sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is that this time, please urge the people of India to use Deepawali as per the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will not only benefit the environment but will also provide employment opportunities to thousands of marble brothers.
I believe that like Lord Acharya, this feeling of yours will reach and propagate in the bottom and corner of India.
I say to the countrymen, if we implement the words of the Lord Acharya in the upcoming festivals, it will be lighted in their homes, but it will be in the houses of the poor to spread light.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army
With our armed forces taking care of the oceans.
50 years have passed since the 1965 war with Pakistan.
A Shouryanjali exhibition was organised at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to make history, it is important to know and understand the pillars of history.
History connects us to our roots.
Losing ties with history, the possibilities of history are also fully demonstrated.
Don't hurry like me.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
That kid's right.
And I've heard questions about what happened.
I didn't feel that it was a bad thing that even the good Parliament I saw in it was discussing about the cleanliness of India.
On the other hand, Parliament on the other hand, a child on the other hand, both of them talk about cleanliness, what is a greater good fortune for a country
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt and awareness about cleanliness.
This will force governments to work.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will have to take up this task for the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi has said
If there is a time for cleanliness and freedom to choose one of these, then I will choose cleanliness first and then I will be free.
Gandhiji gave more importance to cleanliness than freedom.
Gulshan Aarora Mygov.
In this context, he said that he wants to know about Deen Dayal ji's birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men always inspire us.
Our work is not going to be judged by what thinkers our great men were.
Every person who lives and dies for the nation is an inspiration for us.
These days, there are opportunities to remember many great men.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, Lal Bahadur Shastri Jaiprakash Narayan on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
I am particularly looking forward to an agreement on 2nd October.
Whether it benefits or gives equal importance to handloom with Khadi.
Brothers and sisters have a lot of teaching.
The poor widow of Khadi will be brought home.
Therefore, this Diwali will definitely be given a place in the houses and bodies of each one of you.
Look, last time the sales have almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to be here.
I share that with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, Subhas Chandra Bose's family came to see me.
He was his grandson who arranged everything.
I have had the opportunity to spend a long time with the family of Subhas Chandra Bose.
My name is Bhagwani Kathi.
I would like to inform you that the young generation should be made aware of the registration of voters and in the days to come, the participation of the young generation will increase and in the future the participation of the young generation will be greater in government elections and governance.
Thanks to Bhagwari, the name of the voter list and the voter turnout.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India in this regard.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electoral Commission had acted only as a regulator, but for the past few years it has changed a lot.
This is a very good change, but it doesn't matter if only the Election Commission is working.
Generally, I would like to say that the first day of the election will be voted and the first time the water will be made.
One, seven-year-old Kshitij Pandey is studying in 7th class at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Banaras Hindu University.
I want to increase the scientific interest and interest of our children.
9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said she's been saying it since she was 5.
I asked, where did you learn
So I wanted to share with you.
We're doing a lot of things that you don't know on TV or through the newspapers.
My time has to be adjusted with it.
Friends in Akashwani have to wait for me for half an hour.
It's good for a month's broadcast.
The citizens of Hindustan were inspired by the radio about the freedom struggle.
Azad Hind Radio was launched every week through the news bulletin.
He had broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed one year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
We'll meet next month at Man Ki Bati.
May your instructions continue.
Your advice is beneficial to the government.
It starts to make a change.
Your partnership is precious, precious.
Once again my best wishes.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 30th August, 2015 at 11 a.m.
I have a chance to present the things that I understand before you.
Far away, South Indians are celebrating the festival, and on this occasion, I have celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan throughout our country.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all decent friends have adopted these schemes.
I had requested our sisters to implement security schemes at the holy festival of Rakshabandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
My best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan.
Today, a year before I talked to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was made available to a large number of people.
The main source of income is in the banking sector and this EARPAT has formulated a bank friendly scheme to deliver the poor.
Today, more than one lakh bank friends are operating all over the country.
Youngsters have got jobs through this.
You will be happy to hear that within a year, about one lakh and one thousand financial awareness camps have been set up to link the banking sector with the economy and the poor.
I have put these things in front of you, and it's your job to continue this relationship.
All our accounts must be efficient.
In the last few days, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their conversations, i.e. generosity and gentleness in the Sufi tradition, are the rhythms of music.
I am glad that they have invited me to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru went to Bodhgaya.
There will be a chance to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars all over the world.
It will be a very pleasant moment for me, my dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to repeat my thoughts again.
Very long ago, we discussed these issues.
You must have heard, heard me in the parliament, heard in the public meetings, Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have nothing to fear.
I don't have to give anyone such a chance.
We put an ordinance in place.
Ordinance is due to expire tomorrow on 31st August.
I've decided to expire if the term is over.
My farmer brothers and sisters, "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", I would like to convince you that this is not just a signature but a mantra of ours.
I have another thing to say.
Two days ago, 50 years have passed since the 1965 war.
Whenever he remembered the war in 1965, Lal Bahadur used to remember the scientist.
In addition, he will also remember the motto of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is quite natural to remember all the martyrs who have kept the tri-color flag of India and its glory and courage.
I salute all those associated with the war victory of the 65th.
Greetings to the heroes.
We have been inspired by these tricks of history.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of Sufi tradition, I had the opportunity to interact with leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their views.
India is performing well in various fields of science and I am very happy.
In fact, our scientists are doing great things.
How do we bring such research among the masses
How to use these principles on a practical level
I have said in Mann Ki Baat that we should lead our students to science.
I thought there were many opportunities and possibilities.
I would like to tell my dear young friends something special.
In recent times, many guests from all over the world came to India.
Why not connect our festivals with cleanliness
This year, the beginning of the rain was good.
In our country, there is a lot of food grains, oilseeds and pulses.
The poor need food grains and oil to cook vegetables.
However, this time the crops are very pleasant and this year about 50 of the food grains have increased and 33 of the oilseeds have increased.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters who are responsible for this.
My dear countrymen, July 26 has been recorded as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The more the farmers of the country have relations with the land, the more they have relations with the army and the country.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has sent hundreds of enemies.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India can speak in front of the world today.
And that is why my heartfelt congratulations to our brave soldiers on Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Smt. Suchitra Ghawahari of Chennai has sent a number of suggestions.
I believe all of you will send good instructions.
I would like to clarify my point of view.
I don't want anyone to advise, but I don't want to find ways to evacuate the state governments, central governments or local bodies from their respective responsibilities.
Two days ago, I had noticed the sight of a vehicle accident in Delhi, and even after 10 minutes of the accident, the scooter was on the way.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me on these subjects, you talk about road safety issues and make the masses aware.
Be it the Hoskot Niwasee of Bangalore, Prasanka Kunjee of Mudubidri in Karnataka, I don't remember the names of all - I had expressed my concern about this.
Every minute in our country, every accident is happening every day.
A death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most anguishing thing is that about one-third of the deaths are young people between the ages of 15 and 25, each of these deaths seizes the entire family.
Another thing that I suddenly remember is that a small group of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh have touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' means an excellent brother can give his sister a toilet on Rakshabandhan day.
All such brothers and sisters should be inspired to make toilets for their sisters so that the entire district and mothers and sisters do not have to get rid of dirt in the open space.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village inhabited by workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the campaign to build toilets for the past few months.
Now no one has to defecate in the open space in that village.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems in the North-Eastern states.
Seven days camps have been organised in the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a team of Central Government officials will be sent to the North Eastern States.
The results of this effort will be achieved in the days to come.
It is very keen to disappear from science.
In a way, science and technology are the key to development.
Our IAS officers have come up with a lot of learning and sometimes they have to interact with children in school or colleges around 2-4 hours a week and their experiences are their strengths.
We have started it and in the years to come, our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children of the village should not be disturbed when they are studying on exam days.
If we want to set up small and large industries in the villages then we need electricity.
If they want to charge mobile today, they should go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
For this purpose, Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana was launched.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to talk about every Indian.
And, August, September is a celebration period.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Sitting in the midst of the sufficient, he had heard a lot of things in a calm atmosphere, saying a lot of things about 130 crore people with the family.
Sometimes it becomes an inspiration for the needy.
I just used my words, but I didn't feel like I wasn't in this program, it was you.
I felt a virtue.
Anyway, the last chance has come.
In a family atmosphere, Mann Ki Baat, little and little things.
In a way, let us continue this programme by giving birth to a new zeal to change in society and life by giving birth to a new zeal.
A lot of messages have been received in the past months, in which people have said that the lack of Mann Ki Baat is embarrassing.
Sometimes I feel it's a journey from my 'self' to Samasti.
This is the journey from I to Nami.
For me, my conversation with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people started asking questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
For me, I had a chance to face with me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes it becomes a source of inspiration for my thought process.
When people put their challenges before the nation and society, they suggest solutions.
In the letters, people talk about the problems, as well as some suggestions, some imagination, something directly or indirectly.
That is, in a way, I can feel in your words a sign of how peace is attained to society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of soul within the people, strength or power.
We have to unite that strength and that achievement, we have to give them an opportunity, we have to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people want to come together in a strong and active manner in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how happy I am when I analyze these things and how energy I get.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, let's continue with Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country, that election was not for self-interest, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, in any country of the world, the people there would not have voted for democracy alone, regardless of the rights, powers and requirements of the people there.
That was the election that the country saw in 1977.
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India and we feel that this number is normal.
But if we look at the population all over the world, more people than any other country except China have voted in India.
The number of people who voted in 2019 is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the largest democratic elections in the world history.
You can imagine what kind of resources and manpower would have been required to hold such elections.
This election was conducted by lakhs of teachers, officers and other officers during the day.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Paramilitary Party took responsibility for successfully conducting this mission of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel from different states performed duties and worked hard.
As a result of their hard work, more people have been able to vote this time than before.
Over 10 lakh polling stations, over 40 lakh electronic voting machines and over 17 lakh Visiting Machines have been deployed across the country to vote.
You can imagine how long you're ready.
No voter can utilize his voter, and that's why he did all this.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station has been set up only for a woman voter.
You will be surprised to know that the electorate had to travel for two days to get there.
This is the proper respect for democracy.
The world's highest polling station is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahol-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
The percentage of votes for women and men was approximately equal in this election.
There is another fact that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament who have a history.
I congratulate the Election Commission and all the stakeholders associated with the turnout programme and salute the cautious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard me say, "Boke Na Book" is enough.
I said use a book instead of flowers to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books everywhere.
In his stories, the entire psychological emotions of India are enshrined.
While reading the story of 'Damage' he wrote, my mind turned to the economic imbalance that is spreading in society.
I remembered the days of my youth.
How the matter had been discussed all night came to mind.
If you are not able to learn from this story of Jammu's son, Ishwari and Bir of a poor family, then you will not understand when you will be caught in the impact of corruption.
A sensitive boy's love for his grandmother is a fitting feeling at his young age.
When we reach Grandma with a 4-5-year-old Hamid festive landmark that can be used from Chapatti cot, we really see humanitarian sensitivity coming to Paramayat.
After losing the crop, the farmer is glad that he won't have to sleep in the field in the cold winter.
These stories are about a century ago, but their aesthetics still feel so much.
K.
Muraleedharan and P.
Today this library is a guide for all including tribal children.
A successful experiment was the popularity of Gujarat in the name of 'Wanche Gujarat'.
Millions of people of all ages have participated in this enterprise to read books.
In today's digital world, it is time for me to appeal to you and you in the era of Guru Goel to deliver some time in your daily affairs.
You must write about the reading book on the Narendra Modi App and let all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country think of a challenge not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModiApp and MyGov... seeing a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai of Balgavi and Sidhamshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many others like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
Bless you as a mother, so that the grace be upon us.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country and every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available in the rainy season will be collected.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
We will find peace with the peoples participation, with the strength of the people, with the capability, co-operation and determination of one crore and thirty million people.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been formed in the country by giving maximum importance to water.
This will enable all water related issues to be decided.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote letters to villagers all over the country.
I wrote that to save water, to collect water and not to lose every rain, people of the village called for a meeting, to sit with the villagers.
I am glad that they have done it and have laid the foundation stone of thousands of Panchayats on the 22nd of this month.
The people of the villages have resolved to keep every water conserved.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to the message that the village head of Lupung Panchayat in Katakmandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us: My name is Abdul Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us for water conservation, we do not believe that the Prime Minister has written such a letter to us.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all the rural heads and all the rural heads for their enthusiasm.
The people of the village feel that they are now competing to build a temple for water in their village.
As I said, social efforts can bring about qualitative changes.
The country cannot afford any 'strategy' to deal with the water problem.
Several aspects of this effort are being undertaken in different ways.
But everyone's aim is to save water, water conservation.
Drinking lines are being improved in Punjab.
This effort will help in reducing the problem of water conservation.
The construction of tanks in Timmai district of Telangana has transformed the lives of rural people.
Small ponds built on the farmland in Kabirdham, Rajasthan have made a big difference.
I read about a social enterprise in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women gathered to revive the river Nag.
He also read about the women of Gwal who have been making good efforts for water conservation.
I believe that if we make a strong effort together, we can make it impossible.
When people come together, the water will be saved.
I say that the water is touching, and the touch of water will create a new life.
A water conservation campaign can be organised to protect every drop of water.
We can talk about water related issues and also inspire water conservation practices.
I specially urge the distinguished personalities of different fields to undertake different campaigns for water conservation.
Everyone in the film field, in the sports sector, in the media, individuals associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, singing stories and narratives should lead this mass movement in their own way.
We can awaken society, unite society and join society.
Look, we can see a change in front of our eyes.
I urge you all to share your knowledge about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of a revered father, then there should be another house behind his father's house, where there is a 200-year-old reservoir, which still has water.
There is an arrangement for stopping rain water.
I always say that everybody going to the Kirti Mandir must see that water storage.
There must be a variety of water resources in many places.
You can also share your shared knowledge with the Hash Tag at HanShakti4alShakti.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you for one more thing and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, at every corner of the world, if those who love Yoga with the sun rise, welcome the sun, then it is a journey till the sun sets.
Throughout the world, leaders, Prime Ministers, eminent people and common people showed how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
That day the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that a healthy and sensitive person is required to build a healthy society.
Therefore, promoting Yoga is an important matter related to social service.
That kind of service should be accepted and respected.
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for outstanding stakeholders for promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how important they have played for the promotion of Yoga in the field of Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan, where many institutes and training courses are conducted.
Miss Italy.
We have very inspiring examples.
Whether it is a matter of Yoga or not, can Indians stand behind it
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya at Munger was also honoured and they have been working with dedication for the last one decade.
Similarly, he also honoured Swami Rajarshi Muni and established the Life Mission and the Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It is a great journey for me to associate your thoughts with Mann Ki Baat.
Come on, let's sit together, let's share thoughts.
I'll hear what you have in your mind, keep it safe, understand that.
Sometimes we'll try to live with your feelings.
You must be blessed.
You're my inspiration, you're my energy.
Come, let us together share the joy of Mann Ki Baat and take the responsibility of life forward.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Greetings to all fellow citizens on the occasion of 53rd anniversary.
These brave heroes sacrificed themselves for the hundred and fifty five crore Indians.
Our brave sons kept watching the night to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the attackers have been answered in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to disarm terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, I was able to see an exciting response from their families through the medium of martyrdom, which enhances the spirit of the entire nation.
The emotions expressed by the father of the brave Lord Ratan Thakur in Bhagalpur in Bihar during this time of his sorrow are inspiring for all of us.
The nation salutes the bravery of the martyr Prasanna Saheb's Patni Minaji in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
I swear to join the CRPF with one of my own sons.
The same feeling is seen in every household of our brave and courageous martyrs.
I want to tell the youth that the feelings expressed by these families should be understood and understood.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that we have been waiting for in this long period after independence is being witnessed.
It is natural for people to have curiosity and curiosity in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed happiness at the completion of the National War Memorial in Karnataka.
I was astonished and pained that there was not so long a National War Memorial in India.
We needed a war memorial to depict the bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I am happy to note that the decision to build a National War Memorial is being completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i. e.
The country will make a small attempt to repay the debt.
This new memorial has been built in the heart of Delhi, i. e.
I am confident that going to this national military memorial will be equivalent to going to a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of national gratitude to the great martyrs of the nation after Independence.
The design of the memorial shows the courage of our immortal soldiers.
The National Military Memorial is designed in three circles, from the birth of each soldier to the martyrdom.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second chapter shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the greatest martyrs of the country have been recorded in the golden letters.
And then there's a rescue cycle, which shows security.
There's a row of dense trees in this circle.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
It was a reflection of the thought that the nation must be grateful to the police men and women who are constantly working for our security.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever they come, they must share the pictures taken from there in the social media that may inspire others, let them see these memorials in this sacred place.
My dear countrymen, I have received thousands of letters and comments on Mann Ki Baat through a series of media.
Incidentally, on March 3, the birthday of Jamshedji Tata.
Both personalities are from different family backgrounds that have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat, in a way, the pride of Jharkhand reflects history and heritage.
These two great souls have enhanced not only Jharkhand but the entire nation.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire nation.
Do you know why the English have neglected such a cowardly path
Because even the British who built such a great empire were afraid of him.
Birsa used his traditional arrow and wheel to capture the British rule used by guns and cannons.
Birsa Maa fought not only for the freedom of the British but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He lighted like the sun in the dark life of the despised, and of the despised.
He sacrificed his life at the age of 25.
The brave sons of Bharatmaba like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
There will be no corner and none of them who have played their part in this centuries-long freedom struggle.
If the individuals like Birsa Munda make us aware of our ignorance then the personalities like Jamshedji Tata have given the country great institutions.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and this should become an industrial hub.
Today, the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was established as a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jemshedji met Tata and Swami Vivekananda on a ship during his visit to America.
It is said that this discussion has led to the establishment of the India Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country Shri Morarji Bhai Desai was on 29th February.
As you all know, this day comes only once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country, who owned a simple, calm personality.
Morarjibhai has the privilege of presenting the budget as the largest number of times in the Parliament of independent India.
He had to pay for it in his old age.
The government arrested him and sent him to jail.
However, when the Janata Party won the elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The 44th Amendment provides for the publication of proceedings in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in the Press.
Some of the powers of the Supreme Court have been restored through this amendment and the fundamental rights obtained under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be revoked even during emergency.
The Cabinet also provided that the President may declare an emergency and that the term of emergency cannot extend once more than six months.
Morarji Bhai ensured that in 1975, the emergency declared and killed democracy would not be repeated in the future.
He will always remember his great contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to that great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year there is enthusiasm among the people about the Padma Awards this time.
They bring positive change in the lives of others in different ways through their own spirit.
It was a great thing to bring a rare painting closer to the new generation.
I conveyed to the former President of America, Barrack Catholic, the art work of the Tree of Life, built by Abdul Ghafoor.
The Padma Awardees are known as the servants of Shabir Said Gomata of Marathwada.
Listening to the Tao Porchon-ynch of America, you will be surprised to know that Linch is now a big institution for Yoga.
My dear countrymen, this year, there are 12 farmers who have been awarded Padma Awards.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture have come to the list of Padma Shris.
This is a living picture of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I am going to tell you something auspicious, and I have seen it in the last few days.
Brothers and sisters, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how it brings about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If you know someone who's ugly to treat because there's no money, tell them about this plan.
My dear countrymen, this scheme is meant for such poor people and they are going to start their exams in schools.
In the next few weeks, the examinations of various educational boards, sync and class 12 will begin in the country.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are scheduled to appear for the examination.
A few days ago, we had organized a massive Exam Peace Church at Town Hall in Delhi.
With the help of technology in this town hall, I have been able to talk to millions of students, parents and teachers across the country and abroad.
Through the radio, I talk to millions of families in a way every month.
I often think that you are a part of my family when you talk to you and read your letters and listen to the suggestions you send on the phone.
It makes me feel very comfortable.
Friends, elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
Mann Ki Baat has been telling you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat on January 2019
On the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Shri Shivakumar Swamiji became a disabled person from Siddhganga Monastery in Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Shiv Kumaraswamy dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us that Kayakave Kailash, which means that it is the equivalent of Lord Shiva's residence in Kailasa.
Shivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social and educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111-year career.
He was a learned scholar in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his best to provide food, housing, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His priorities were good for the farmers.
Siddhganga Monastery was usually organising cattle-carshika fairs.
I have often got the good fortune of getting the blessings of the venerable Swami ji.
On this occasion, Kalam Saheb had heard a poem about Swami ji.
Once again I pay my homage to that great soul.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, 1950, the Constitution was introduced in our country.
Our country for the Republic that day.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day.
But I would like to tell you something else.
This day is being celebrated as the National Voters Day.
People all over the world are surprised to see the massive election process in India.
It is natural for all the citizens of our country to be proud of the Election Commission, to see that our Election Commission is doing it very well.
You must have heard that there is only one polling booth in the Gir forest of Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission for its constant efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission, the Security Officers and other officers of all the States who are participating in the polling process, for ensuring free and neutral elections.
This year, there will be Lok Sabha elections in our country.
This will be the first opportunity for youngsters born in the 21st century to use their voter turnout in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to responsibilities of the country.
They are going to determine the country's brotherhood.
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the nation.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter if it is the age of voting.
At the same time, we have to think that it is our duty to vote.
If there is no reason to vote in life for any reason, it must be painful.
I'm sorry to see something wrong happens in the country.
Our country is a great Vasundhara.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of those great events.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I got the good opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who had played a key role in India's independence.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings have been closed till date.
The locked rooms in the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Every rock of this museum is filled with the aroma of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum, the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle reflect and inspire us to go to history.
At the same place, the British administration had filed a case against Bharatamba's brave sons - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurbaksh Dhilan and Major General Shanwas Khan.
I gave it to the museum to keep the hat and I wanted the visitors to see the hat and inspire the patriotism from it.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must continue to bring new generations back in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, 75 years ago, as part of a programme highlighting the Golden Jubilee Edition.
Similarly, in October 2018, the Red Fort will always be surprised to raise a tri-flag because the flag will be raised on 15th August.
Now it was the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Azad Hind Government.
Dilli Chalo, Tum Me Khun Do, Mim Tumme Asadi Dumga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom) and through the mudras like that, Netaji got a place in the hearts of all Indians.
There has been a lot of demand for files related to Netaji to the public for the past several years.
I'm glad I could do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's family members came together to the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy to note that there has been an attempt to develop several places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
Be it 26 Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir, it will be a pleasure.
If you come to Delhi, you must go to see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story about Netaji's life.
He had also chosen a radio to interact with the people and in 1942, he launched the Subhas Babu Azad Hind Radio.
I understand that this radio station has been broadcasting news bullets every week, which was in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashuto and Urdu languages.
Gujarati M.
R.
Vyas had played a very important role.
Normal people liked the programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio.
Those programmes provide a lot of energy to the freedom fighters.
Visual museum is also organised in this Kranti temple .
We have tried to describe Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, which have more than 450 paintings and other art forms of three centuries old.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Silos Mukherjee etc.
I specially urge you all to go there and keep the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering why I ask for the great writings of Gurudev Tagore while talking about art.
Perhaps you might have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, drawn numerous natural scenes, and has further enriched human nature and art through canvas.
It is important to mention that Gurudev had not given his name to many of his compositions.
He thought that those who saw the paintings he had painted should understand the painting himself and let the message he has given in it know through his own perspective.
His pictures are displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our great minds have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas was such a great soul.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas.
The Dohas of Saint Ravidas ji are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the sacred land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, he tried to convey the glory of those who worked and worked for the rest of their lives.
Our space programme contributes to several young scientists from across the country.
Today, we are proud that our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets.
On January 24, the art of our students has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by students in Odisha have also been set up in the new record.
Spass missions have been launched in the last four years since independence to 2014.
We have established the World Record to launch 104 satellites in one atmosphere.
We will soon make Indias presence on the moon through Chandrayaan 2.
Our country uses space technology to save lives and property of the people.
Whether it is climate prophecy or rail or road safety, space technologies are very helpful in all.
Naval equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers and sisters, which is helpful in economic recovery along with their security.
We use space technology to bring government services to the people and to determine its responsibility effectively.
Under the Housing for All (HFO) scheme, about 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been tagged into geo-tagged.
Moreover, under Manrega, nearly three and a half million earthquakes have been tagged.
Our satellites today are symbols of the growing power of the country.
Through our competitive satellite launch service, India today launches satellites not only of developing countries but of developing countries.
Sky and stars are always attractive to children.
Our space programmes provide an opportunity to children to think a lot and go beyond the limits that they have thought it impossible.
It's watching stars for our children and inspiring them to discover new stars.
In the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune in January, 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games.
This time, in Khelo India, sportspersons from all the states performed well in their own way.
Life of many medal winners is a powerful inspiration.
The young player in wrestling won the Akash Gorkha Silver Medal and I read that Akash's father, Mr.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Helvi Satara, the captain of the 21 women Kabadi team of Maharashtra, is also a person living in Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged Sonali's talent.
It is usually seen that girls do not get such encouragement in sports like Kabadi.
But Sonali chose kabadis and showed the best performance.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Asansol, is the youngest gold medal in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswanikamati, the daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, received a gold medal in loading.
When we talk about Indias manufacturing, we should recall that the vision of New India is Youth Power.
While narrating these stories of Khelo India, we must remember that New India is not only a contribution of the people of big cities, but also a contribution of youngsters and young sports persons from small towns, villages and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about the beauty of your name.
Have you ever heard of a competitor to make toilets beautiful
More than 50,000 toilets have participated in this unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and the rural heads to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
You must share the picture of your Swachh Sundar Shauchalay with Mylathar in the 400 media.
Friends, on 2nd October, 2014, we started a memorable journey to make the country dirt-free and to avoid open defecation.
My little friends, the days of the exam are coming closer.
Asul Sharma MyGov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written that I should talk about exam warriors and exam warriors.
Thank you for taking this matter into consideration.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is examination papers.
I would like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but I would like to talk to students from all over the country at 11. 00 AM on 29th January, 2019, along with students, parents and teachers will participate in the discussion.
This time students from other countries are also participating in the event.
I would like to talk to my young friends about all aspects related to the examination, especially the stress free examination.
I will certainly put some of these suggestions and suggestions in front of you at the Town Hall.
You must join this program.
You can see this being broadcast on the 400 media or on the App Lude.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is a memorial of revered father.
On 11th, the entire nation will pay homage to the martyrs.
We must pay our homage for two minutes of martyrdom everywhere.
Remembering the revered Bapu, fulfilling his dreams, building a New India, and fulfilling his duties as citizens.
We will successfully take this journey of 2019.
Greetings to all of you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
Greetings, my dear countrymen.
It's about to end 2018.
We are entering in 2019.
Obviously, during this period, we have been discussing last year and we can also hear the discussions about the year ahead.
Whether it is the life of the individual or of the society or of the life of the nation, everybody has to look back and look forward to it as much as possible.
This is the result of the achievements of experiences and the confidence to do something new.
We have to think of bringing about changes in our lives and contributing to taking the country and society forward.
I wish you all the very best in 2019.
As a result of the determination of the people of the country, the value of cleanliness has gone up by 95 percent.
After independence, for the first time from the Red Fort, the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government was lifted by a triangular flag.
The country received the Champions of the Earth Award, the highest environmental recognition of the United Nations.
Indias efforts in solar energy and climate change have been approved globally.
The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was the first convention of the International Solar Alliance in India.
Our country has had unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business Ranking.
Our girls have enhanced the country's pride by nurturing the world with the help of naval civilizations.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The Bogibeel Bridge, the longest rail-road bridge in the country, was dedicated to the nation and the first and 100th airport of Sikkim was inaugurated in Pakyong.
Under 19 cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup, India was successful.
This time, India has won many medals in the Asian Games.
India has shown great performance in the Para Asian Games.
Our Mann Ki Baat will go a long way in 2019 when all the social initiatives of the country begin to be listed.
All this has been possible because of the untiring efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that in 2019, this journey of India's elevation and progress will continue and our country will scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some of our brethren who are specialists in December.
Dr. Jaichandran was known as one of the cheapest treatment providers for the poor.
Similarly, on December 25, Sulagiti Narasamma of Karnataka was killed.
Sulagiti Narasam was helpful in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They have provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the peninsular areas.
There are many inspiring people like Jaichandran and Sulagiti Narasamma.
They have dedicated their lives for the good of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, we also want to talk about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some party activists have told me that some young doctors in the city have been camping and treating the poor.
Medical camps are conducted every month through the Heart Lungs Critical Centre, where there is a provision for free diagnosis and treatment of many diseases.
Today, hundreds of patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors, who are selflessly serving, must be appreciated.
Today, I can say with great pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful mission only through social efforts.
A few days ago, more than three lakh people in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh were involved in the cleanliness drive.
City Corporate, Service Organizations, School-college students and all the people of Jabalpur participated enthusiastically in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm Thebetterindia.
Whenever I get a chance, I definitely go to Thebetterindia.com and try to know about such inspirations.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us to many stories that inspire us to lives of people with distinctiveness.
com is an attempt to promote positivity in a site society and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, yourstory. com tells us a lot about young innovators and the success stories of industrialists.
Combine positivity and make it virtuous.
I am confident that more and more people will know about our heroes who bring about changes in society.
It's very easy to spread negativeness.
But, in our society, we have very good things, which can be achieved by the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
He lives in Anantnag, Kashmir, a 12-year-old man.
Hanna Dhyanit and Karate taught me to understand, to know about its various levels, to prove herself.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
My best wishes and blessings to Hannah.
Likewise, a 16-year-old boy, Rajini, had a lot of discussions on the media.
You must have read.
Rajni Junior Mahila Wrestling won gold medal at the Championship.
As soon as he won the Rajni medal, the child went to the shop where he got the milk and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni Medal was wrapped in a cloth and placed in a bag.
You might be wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The kid who did that was honouring Jasmersing, who sells luxury at a stall in his sin.
Rajni said his father suffered a lot of hardships in bringing the maid to this level.
Jasmer Singh is going to work in the morning before Rajini and his brothers wake up.
When he informed his father about his interest in learning royal boxing, he arranged all possible things and encouraged his daughter's enthusiasm.
Rajini's wrestling training took the old gloves, because at that time the family's financial condition was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni didn't get excited, wrestling had to be learned.
He has won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune has become the fastest person in the world to cycle.
The boy travelled 300 kilometers a day on a bike for 159 days.
The zeal of that child is certainly commendable when he kicks his bike.
We don't get inspired by such talents.
Many good wishes to our Annadata farmers and brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions like unity in diversity, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, etc. fills our festivals.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, here individuals and satisfaction are the same.
A good example of our close relationship with nature is the calendar and Panchangam based on festivals.
This will provide information on the planets and the stars and the planets throughout the year with festivals.
It's decided according to which calendar is absolved.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planetary constellation in many parts of the country.
Gudi Padwa, Chetichand and Ugadi are celebrated according to the lunar calendar. On the other hand, Tamil Puttan, Vishu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakhi, Bihu, all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of sunrise.
In our festivals, the feeling of causing rivers and water is particularly inherent.
The Chhath festival is related to sunrise in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people drown in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an ancient significance, on the other hand, all festivals tell the lessons of life and the motivation to live with one another in a very natural way.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best in your hearts to celebrate the upcoming festivals.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the world come and participate in Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh is a crowd of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from within and outside the country gather together.
The legacy of the Kumbh has spread to our great cultural heritage.
Perhaps you will be eagerly waiting for the world famous Kumbh festival that is being celebrated in Prayagraj since January 15 this year.
The Saint-Mahatmal has already reached for the Kumbh Mela.
It is a big proof that UNESCO has included the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in Manizla that is globally important.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries saw preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
There the people of many countries raised their voices.
People from over 150 countries can reach this Kumbh in Prayagraj.
This is a major study study for the youth, especially for the youth.
I had gone to Prayag Raj a few days ago and I saw preparations for the Kumbh.
This time, we are also giving great importance to cleanliness.
In the process, there will be cleanliness with devotion and the message will reach far away.
This time devotees will be able to see Akshayvad after performing their holy rituals in the Sangam.
This symbol of the faith of the people had been shut down in the fort for hundreds of years, so the devotees could not see even if they wanted.
This time everyone has been allowed to go there.
All of you must attend the Kumbh Mela and share the pictures of different heads in the middle of the society so that more and more people get inspired to go to the Kumbh Mela.
May the spiritual Kumbh be the glory of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of faith be the glory of nationalism.
May the Kumbh of artistic arts be the glory of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of people on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations on 26th January and on that day we remember the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the centenary year of the revered father.
His Excellency Mr.
Cyril Ramaphosa is visiting India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day this year.
There was an unparalleled relationship between revered Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan, the Great Spirit was from this South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa with strong opposition to colourful discrimination.
He established Phoenix, Tolstoy Farms, from where the chain of peace and justice flowed all over the world.
He had the patience and inspiration to stay in jail for so many years.
Mandela wrote about Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because this is where he started the tests of truth.
This is where he showed his firm stature for justice, where he raised the vision and struggle of Satyagraha.
He saw Bapu as a roll model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiring the whole world but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, just a few days ago, there was a conference of DGPs at Kavadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat where there was a statue of Statue of Unity all over the world.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the nation.
He has always lived up to the integrity of India.
Sardar Saheb had thought that Indias strength depends on its diversity.
In recognition of Sardar Saheb's emotions, I pay tributes to him through this award for Unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
Guru Govind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For a long time in his life, his workplace was North India, and he was shot at Namdet in Maharashtra.
In the land of Patna, the land of work is North India, the last moment of life is in Namded.
In a way, the year of India received his blessings.
After the martyrdom of Guru Tej Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji attained the position of Guru at the age of nine.
Guru Govind Singh Ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
While he was the owner of a calm and simplistic personality, whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, Guru Govind Singh ji raised his voice for the poor and the weak, that is why: - (Sawa Lakh se Ek Ladam Chidiom Som Baj Tudam Tudam Tudam Tudamtabe Govind Singh Nam Kahla.
He was a divine man full of heroism, valour, sacrifice and religious compassion.
He had supernatural weapons and scientific knowledge.
Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi and Urdu were also known as many languages.
I once again bow down to Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, many good things happen in the country but there is no detailed discussion about them.
As part of the Right India campaign, the country is organising health tours.
The event will take place by 27th January.
It is a matter of gratitude that I am trying to spread awareness and knowledge among the people across the gap.
When India is clean then it will be prosperous.
Nutrition is the most important thing for good health.
To start with this thing.
The lessons on the importance of food need to be learnt from childhood.
Come, let us move ahead to scale new heights for new achievements with new inspiration, enthusiasm and determination, let us change ourselves and change our country.
Like MyGov, Amshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Amritsar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, the Prime Minister asked about the same question as Monica Jane from Delhi in April, the Prime Minister's Government from Burdwan in West Bengal, and musicians from Nagpur.
They say that people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It was in 1998.
I was working as an organisation of Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
It was May.
It was a little Daba.
I don't understand.
Seeing my response, he said, look, sir, listen to the radio.
Next time Akashwani conducted a survey on Manki Baat.
Some Facebook responses are very interesting.
Average 70 of the surveyed are usually listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has developed a positive thinking in the society.
Many people have been encouraged by Mann Ki Baat.
A wide range of discussions were held on India Positive.
I am happy to see that radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets a mike, millions and millions of people have to listen, then what do you want
Their discovery is that there is no politics in this program.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it was decided that there should not be politics in it, this should not be the benefits of the government, it should not be Modi.
I was inspired by you the most inspired of my decision to be implemented.
Small stories of 130 crore people will always remain.
It will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read the letter, a feeling like that makes me feel like that.
With two words, I share it with you with my experience.
When will a government be able to inspire not only all over the country but also abroad by launching a Selfie with Dotter programme in a small village in Haryana
All sections of the society, known as celebritys, have joined it and awakened the thinking of the society in a new language that today's generation understands.
Mann Kibat is not about the government, it is about the society.
Manki Baat is a matter of progress awaiting India.
India's life is not politics, not power.
India's vibrant social justice is the strength of society.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of them is political.
If everything becomes political, it's not good for the society.
Sometimes, political events and political activists, and other talents of the society, embrace their livelihoods.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
People's letters reach before all Mann Ki Baat.
Before Mann Ki Baat, I try to see the best letters and read the commands.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As Mann Ki Baat approaches, I read your ideas and inputs very carefully during the journey.
So whenever you read a letter, the environment of the writer, his emotions become part of my thoughts.
That letter is not just a paper piece for me.
For the past 40-45 years, I have been leading the life of a dynasty, I have gone to most of the districts of the country, I have spent a lot of time in remote districts of the country.
The proposals of the letters not included in Mann Ki Baat are also being taken into consideration in the respective departments.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels, Champions media etc.
Mann Ki Baat is capable of reaching more people because of their hard work.
Akashwani's team prepares all episodes to broadcast in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the same voice as Modi in local language.
Thus, they become Modi for 30 minutes.
My best wishes and thanks to them for their talent and skills.
I urge all of you to listen to this program in local languages.
In their channels, I would like to thank friends of the media who have listened to Mann Ki Baat every month.
A person in politics is not happy about the media, he feels that he gets a very little coverage, and if he gets a coverage then he will say that it is a negative coverage.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'm doing it in every family.
It's easier to understand if we don't get through the old sheep of our own life.
I don't know if a man abandoned his thoughts and accepted his thoughts.
The uniqueness of today's youth is that they do not do anything that is unbelievable to themselves, if they believe in something then they leave everything for it and pursue it.
Sometimes people talk about interactions with youngsters in their families.
In fact, the limit for talking to young people in most families is very small.
It is said that don't do that about things that are studying for long, or about habits and lifestyles.
I have been trying to constantly interact with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I'm trying to learn from them what they're doing, what they think.
They always have the treasure of ideas.
They are very powerful, newly discovered and focussed.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to make the youth's problems more and more connected.
Often there are complaints that youngsters are raising more questions.
I'm saying that the youngsters are better to ask questions.
We feel that todays youth are very important participants and they think very big things.
It is good to have dreams and great achievements - ultimately this is New India, New India.
Some say that the youth want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking you what's wrong with this.
Many things are being done simultaneously because they're capable of multi-tasking.
Whether it is social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other area, it is the youth who bring about big changes in society.
Young people who dared to ask questions and see new dreams.
If we bring the thoughts of the youth to the ground, and give them an open environment to express them, we can bring about progressive changes in the country and they do so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji MyGov of Gurugram has written in this Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about the Constitution Day.
It is a humble statement that the day is great because we enter the seventy years of our constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
The Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days to fulfil this historic task.
Just imagine, within three years, this great magnificence has given us such a wide and wider constitution.
An example of today's time management and productivity is that they have created the constitution at such an unusual pace.
It will also inspire us to fulfil our responsibilities on record time.
The Constitution was a combination of the great talents of the country, all of them were committed to empowering India and giving it to the Constitution that empowers the poorest of the poor.
When India completed 60 years of its republic in 2010, the elephants in Gujarat were brought to the forefront by the Constitution.
It was an opportunity to remind the youngsters to raise awareness about the Constitution and connect them with various stakeholders of the Constitution.
In 2020, we will complete 70 years of our Republic and 75 years of our Independence in 2022.
Let us take our constitutional values forward and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that even though Indians are different, we must be the best nation.
India First India is the first ever Dr.
All State Governments and Union Territories have been advised to observe this opportunity very well.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Along with this, a train will run on the way to holy places related to Guru Nanak Devji.
I was reminded of the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Sahab when I attended this meeting.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara suffered major losses.
Our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the deeper our journey will be, the greater it will bring happiness to all.
Sometimes there's a question in somebody's mind. What have I got in Mann Ki Baat
Your noble wishes are my great wishes.
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31st October is the victory of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the unity of the country for the Run for Unity.
The weather is very comfortable now.
I urge you all to participate in the Rankfor Unit with enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before the Independence, the world's most famous international renowned magazine The Time Magazine became a picture of Sardar Patel on the cover page of lease published on 27th January, 1947.
They gave a picture of India along with an important article, which we did not see today.
It was a picture of India that was scattered in many parts.
There were more than 550 nations at that time.
The interests of the British on India remained unprecedented.
He said how he did rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s.
Burdoli has given a sense of direction to the Satyagraha.
From farmers, workers to industrialists, everyone can trust him and his faith and commitment to the nation.
Sardar Patels Jayanti will be more special on 31st October and the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel on this day.
Located on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is double the stake of liberty in America.
This is the tallest Gaganasparshi idol in the world.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians that the world's tallest statue is in India.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the soil, would be decorated with the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated Infantry Day.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian diaspora.
I salute the families of the soldiers in the name of their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of Hindustan, are celebrating Infantry Day
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in the land of Kashmir and kept Kashmir from the hijackers.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manek Shaw, the great military ruler of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manek Shah is talking about the period when he was a field marshal.
At that time, in October 1947, military operations began in Kashmir.
31st October is a day to recall our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid floral tributes to Dr.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are important in the world of sports.
It's not a triumph of a player's victory.
Recently, two meetings were held in memory.
First of all, the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes.
Similarly, in Argentina, there was an opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018.
In the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth have shown the best performance ever.
We have won 13 medals and three medals in MICS.
This is the story of Indian Sports which touches new heights per day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one has ever thought.
When he was 8, he lost his father.
He lived in orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, DDC cleared the buses to move forward and worked as a waiter on the shores of Delhi.
Today, in the same Narayan International, gold medals are being received for India.
Not only this, look at the heights of excellence in India's sports.
India has never won an Olympic Medal either in Senior Level or Junior Level in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo at the Youth Olympics and composed history.
Tababi Devi, a 16-year-old player, lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a worker, and the mother is a fisherman.
Often this child's family had no money to buy anything for food.
Even in such a scenario, the zeal of Goddess Tababi didn't touch the castle.
And then he wrote history by winning medals for the country.
There are countless stories like this.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is about New India.
My dear countrymen, in 2017, we successfully organized the FIFA U-17 World Cup.
As a tournament conducted successfully, the entire world appreciated it.
This year, India has had the privilege of organizing the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever game is played, there must be a tea for the hockey in any game.
India has presented great hockey players.
Whenever there is a discussion about global hockey, the story of Hockey will be incomplete besides these great sportspersons of India.
The Hockey wizard knows Major Dhyanchand all over the world.
Subsequently, a long journey has been undertaken from Balwinder Singh Senier, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj.
Even today, team Indian sportspersons inspire the new generation of Hockey through their successes due to their spirit and dedication.
Sports is a good opportunity for lovers to see thrilling games.
Going to Bhubaneswar and enhancing the enthusiasm of the Indian team, it should not only be done but also encourage all the teams.
But in a new era, in a new era, in a new generation, with new enthusiasm, with new enthusiasm, with new zeal, we are coming forward to do this thing with new dreams.
Some teach children, some teach adults, some are engaged in cleanliness, some are helping farmers.
There is no desire to do all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play wheelchair basketball himself to help the wheelchair basketball team of Divyangjans.
This spirit, this dedication is a work on Mission Mode.
Wouldn't any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I looked at the suggestions related to Mann Ki Baat, I found a very attractive note of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
In Mann Ki Baat, he has written on MyGov, how the people of India, their livelihoods and traditions become an excellent example of co-existence with nature.
We need to learn from them what we need to make our traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Mr. Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this issue in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter of motivation for us to look at our glorious past and culture, especially in the world, especially in the context of environmental protection and seeking new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and plants like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship the trees called Almond and Arjun with respect.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to preserve the environment.
Especially for protecting the trees, they don't want to give up their own lives, but they don't agree to harm even a tree.
Mistresses from Arunachal believe that they have a direct relationship with the tigers.
They think them like their own sisters.
People from the Varali community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and for them the presence of tigers will bring prosperity.
Gaud tribes of Central India stop fishing in some parts of the river Kaithan during fish breeding.
They see these terrains as dependents on fish and they get good fish because of their preservation.
Toda, a small extraordinary community in the isolated areas of Nilgiri in south India, has traditionally built their houses because of the things available in that area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living very peacefully and with one another, but if anyone harms their natural resources, they will not hesitate to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our early freedom fighters had tribal people.
Come on, let's show respect to them.
My dear countrymen, we talk about those who do extraordinary work for society in Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Bhai Gurubachan Singh of Punjab.
One ordinary teacher was married to Gurubachan Singh.
But you will be surprised to know that an ordinary farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the bride's father that the condition he put forward is the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them that he would not burn the vaccine anymore.
You can imagine how big social force it has.
It seems simple, however, however, his personality is so enormous that there are many families in our society that make personal matters the subject of social good.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji is such an example in front of us.
I read another village in Punjab about the rock mazar near Nabha.
The people of stone mazra, instead of burning the mirror, mix it on the ground and use technology for it.
Best wishes to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to people from all over the world who have made great efforts to keep the environment clean and clean.
You live as the real heirs of Indian tradition of healthy lifestyle.
Om Dyeh Shanti Shree Shanti Shreeva Shanti Shreeva Shanti Shree Shanti Shree Shanti Shree Shanti Shree Shanti Shree Shanti Shree Shanti Shree Shanti Shreeva means peace in all three worlds, whether it is peace in all three worlds, in water, in the earth, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the medicines, in the plants, in the plants, in the plants, in the unconsciousness, in the entire universe.
May there be peace in the living creatures, in the heart, in me, in the particles of the world everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a great event.
Obviously, we had no direct contact with that war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely, played a very big role and carried out great martyrdom.
When the Indian soldiers came to war, they showed the world that they were not behind anyone.
In the First World War, the world saw the threshold of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and almost equally ordinary people have died.
Through this, the whole world understands the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony are not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, we need to work in harmony with each other.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a real symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the issue of our Northeast is different.
Its natural beauty is unique and its people are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now known for a lot of goodwill.
The North-Eastern region has grown immensely in terms of organic farming, organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the Key Future Policy Gold Award 2018 in promoting sustainability.
It means food and agricultural organisations.
The award for excellent policy formulation in this field is equivalent to that of Oskar in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim state has won the award by following 51 designated policies of 25 countries.
I extend my best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is ending.
There's a lot of change in the weather.
In a way, Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayadooj and Chhath, the month of November is the month of festivals.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country, let us take a pledge to move forward in a mission mode in your lives.
