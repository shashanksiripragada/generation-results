Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling with lack of funds to improve the highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which is fitted with cleaning on your car's dashboard. .
This device, which tracks every milestone carried by the motor driver and communicates the information to the authorities, has now become the issue of a controversial effort for Washington and State Planning Office to restore the old system to finance the major US roads.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
You have joined the Liberatorian Environmental Groups in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep details of the miles driven by you, and possibly the driven location - and then use this information to prepare the tax bill.
The tea party is bewildered.
The American Civil Liberty Association is also very worried about raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are searching for how they can go to such a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken a black box for the test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"It is not a matter of being elected or not elected by us, it is to say that Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every mile set by motor-drivers in California by 2025. Is making. "
The way we pay tax is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the highway trust fund of the country has become almost bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes on the gas pump by American citizens.
American people do not buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more than before in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in the Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cent per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians refrain from increasing a single penny in tax.
Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, "Gas is not absolutely sensitive."
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run it will work as the most logical option."
Wonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to the urban liberals, as this, for example, can change taxes to change the mode of driving, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
The planners of California are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendor in the Region Foundation is also in favor of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, vice-president of the policy in the region, said, "It is not just doing that which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had graceed to move forward in the direction of payment of per-mile from the Congress.
The US Senate had approved a 90-million test project last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing such persons who had to walk a lot of miles to go to work daily or to go to the city, the leadership of the House ended that proposal at the same time.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most interested Oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, including 17 State Transport Departments (including Meriland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support at all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the driver was very impatient thinking that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who guides the strategic and execution management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other things of the same kind was a major problem.
This is not something people wanted.
With the advancement of the test, Nevada's ACLU had warned on its website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which must be spread to keep every person's daily commuter record.
Nevada is one of the many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles the car is running every day, but not where and what time it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has brought some state agencies to the small California Start-up named Tru Miles.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
However, the device which it is testing is good for the highway planners as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a certain time interval.
Ryan Morison, chief executive of Tru Miles, said, "If you do not track the speed and location of the people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are very few costly and less interfering methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to drivers.
They can select GPS devices with or without GPS.
Or you can not choose to take any device again, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of the average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places are expected to sell this concept to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than less in the device.
In New York City, Transport Officers are trying to develop a taxing device, which will also facilitate payment of parking meter fees, "payment insurance according to their drive, and actual time speed data from other drivers. It will be used to avoid motor-driven traffic. "
The city planning document mentions, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participate due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payment according to miles is a big deal.
Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Gulf region has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankrupt highway trust fund by increasing gas tax very easily.
Additional one-time or annual fee can also be levied on drivers of hybrids or other cars, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their dues.
Randy Rentcheller, director of the Commission's legislation and public affairs, said, "When Aspirin can work, what is the need for radical surgery for it."
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death has happened due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the departed goods with him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Daria.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the inquiry that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhal went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the luggage on the shore, while Ruhal went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched for ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, clock and other things and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death has happened due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhal has been taken into custody under Section 404 to hide the facts and the goods of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Sylvio Berlusconi, who is known for Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl very intelligencefully.
This has been disclosed by his family friend Marthel Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been the Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Franciska Pascal in her personal chapel.
Francisco's meeting with Balusconi came when he was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia Party.
It is Franciska right there, whose relationship was being said that his relationship with Balrusconi is merely a pretext.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga Girl Marthel Polonco have revealed that they were also invited to this intelligence marriage.
This ceremony has happened three weeks ago.
In the disclosure on Italian Radio2, when Polanko was asked what would happen if both of them got married, Polanko has said that both of them are already married.
This was not a public function.
This marriage took place in a private chapel located in the former Prime Minister's house.
No one can tell anything other than this.
Although he did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjoda.
Both of them got married about three weeks ago i.e. 8 or 9 October.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old 28-year-old woman from her was engaged to Franciska Pascal.
In order to avoid the misery, Berlusconi formed the basis of loneliness behind this decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued to intermittently between the sun's eye and Michauli.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has dropped to 4.8 degrees Celsius, minus -0.2 degrees in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, due to rain and snow, the strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has closed for traffic.
There is heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.

Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People are lurking in homes to avoid cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply in many areas was also stalled.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, once again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a dracula drinking blood of children, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news from running the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter and said that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the case of the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the public exchequer.
By doing so, the TDS rupee was deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai took action with the Jaipur Exploration Team on this group.
In the investigation of this episode, it was found that this trader has cut the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the process of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was about 15 days ago, raids and surveys were carried out on this mall operator's group.
Angered by this action, the trader has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupee to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously taking action by targeting them.
In this case, the officials investigating have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
Given Deepawali, demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake sweets and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70 thousand rupees from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand glasses from uetta Colony.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, demand for poor flour from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The Department got information about bringing the poor Mave kept in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Mave's consignment is being floated from transport garage.
The department took possession of this mave, which was valued at 70 thousand rupees.
Fear of action did not express any right to the maternal uncle.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand glasses.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphate was used to shine brightness and stay for longer days.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
Department's co-house S. S. Deshmukh said that the campaign for chemical sweets and poor and fake mattresses will continue.
In the next few days, the information about speeding up this campaign has been given by the department.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause toxicity.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from the flour.
An appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the Department to be cautious of fake sweets and maves.
Selected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received him strongly at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come to Bihar for a visit to the consolation organized by the BJP.
The consolation pilgrimage was organized by the BJP on behalf of the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the Hunker rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts after one.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people would be casualties and there was panic in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday after taking bones and bones from their village.
On November 5, all those bones will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
Santana Yatra is organized as a part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of the people killed in the blasts from seven o'clock on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the relatives of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the bogus victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series after the two ODIs were washed away due to the rain, and its batsmen performed a bat and won a record victory, causing the team to match 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, in the form of Rohit and Summit, the team has got such a salute pair which is easing the work of the rest of the batsmen with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a spectacular partnership in opening.
On the third number, Kohli has performed so far, he is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have termed them better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years next week, has installed 17 ODIs, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, their average is above 80.00 and they have emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in a strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened accounts in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as a 'lifeline'.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have influenced everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding that they be taken in the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen to the ninth number.
In addition to Bailey, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Wogs and James Fockner have made good bats in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aron Finch have not left any effect in opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be huge to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed well in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashes series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this showing peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists near 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even worse.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lieutenant General aheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks in the killing of soldiers on the border, Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolishing the privileges of the army in such a situation as fatal, the BJP leader said that doing such things is also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
They get anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders, the morale of the security forces should be banned.
Prepare Snow Dan to collaborate with Germany on American vigilance
Edward Snow Den, the US intelligence informer, has declared that German is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fail to respond to their activities. Are there.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle met Mr. Snow Den Segurwar in Russia, where he was given shelter to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den in front of the media in Berlin on Friday, "Although the results of my efforts are positively positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party change, and provides no defense, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with felony charges. "
However, speaking the truth hasn't been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, Minister of German Internal Affairs, told online Weit: Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure because the NSA has bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence.
Mr. Belle, a Green Party MP from Germany, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their journey to Russia.
Mr. Belen said, according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, then Snow Dan is not able to go back to Russia.
If Snow Den testified in Germany, he would be safe there.
Mr. Snow Den said in his letter that he had to face a terrible and persistent campaign and had to compel him to leave the house.
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by widespread reactions to its work of political expression.
Together with the United States - world citizens as well as high officials have underestimated the revelation of a irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a resolution to cooperate with the German authorities when the problems of human conditions have been resolved .
Crontier Airlines will charge Carry - On Baggage
Crontier Airlines plans to charge  100 to store luggage for passengers on its board of flights.
In Crontier Airlines, there is a plan to start a charge for 100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it announced that the passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carry-on fee is for the bag in overhead bin, so, the small bag below the seat will still be charged free.
Crontier said that  25 will charge if payment is made in Advance, "100 will have to wait if the passengers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
rontier spokesman Kate O'Mally said that  100 fees are to be obtained to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger fees can do as much as they can in the carriage on baggage that is stashed in the overhead box , it means that there is often less space in this box .
There's a way to bring down to the passengers on the fee board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's faster for the most loyal customers about Crontier to find that overhead bin's place.
Passengers who buy tickets in their airline website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in line can pay 100 dollars for the same bag, while a passenger can get a bag free in line at a frontier gate.
O'Malley said that the procedures of Crontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that the passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Crontier's new carrier - on fees will not start up to summer even though a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but the airline likes them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them haven't even touched the carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the carry-on fee for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, the other airline is Hungary's i Air, which airline adviser J Sorensen said, and who tracks the ad-on fees.
He said that Spirit's carry-on duty brings 50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official recently flew to Spirit and wondered if the passengers had to face carriage-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process I saw in my airline career was comfortable, he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he offered it a licketty-split."
Crontier is also following  2 fees of coffee, tea, soda, or spirit for juice.
Crontier said that the passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and it'll give free coffee only for once.
It'll still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after seven months after the complaint of the passengers, they retreated and followed any other main airline after being there.
If the passengers of Crontier's do not buy directly from the airline, then this move by Crontier to charge the fare on the carrier is its latest attempt to operate the customers towards their own website.
Airlines pays online travel vendor for such 10 to 25 each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people rather than go through an online travel agency.
Crontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September many often started flying halfway at a distance of miles for the customers who bought from these persons from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award up to 25 percent of the trip meal.
So, a 1000 miles longer trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows the only passengers to choose their seat in advance if they buy directly from the Crontier website.
Customers have a loyal base in their hometown in Denver, Crontier, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. Wednesday.
Republics are trying to fix Crontier's finance as part of the airline sales.
NSA charged "internal error" rather than hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortcomings, our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
In an email statement, the intelligence agency said, "NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight, which was due to internal error during the pre-determined update."
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not accessible.
A NSA spokesman told ABC News that "the agreement was not reached" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one Hactivist Group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
The DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity until the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and the aim of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the target system.
The unprecedented mysterious NSA, once known as "no such agency", has become the subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people by the presence of a large number of incidents of foreign and domestic espionage programmes in the past months, which have been collectively displaced by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden after the stolen and revelation of secret NSA files from the agency.
Due to this growing controversy about the agency, after the incident of tonight, there was speculation that this incident was the result of the targeted cyber operation.
Beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the story of 'One and Dronacharya' showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path by mortgaging in the fleet.
The play was inaugurated jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
In the drama, Dronacharya of Dwapar era and presently the similarity of the circumstances of a professor Arvind was shown.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Behan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a spectacular presentation while doing complete justice with the characters.
In the drama, the lighting system was done by young color worker Jitendra C. Raj and set designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, a variety of awards were given to the Vibhutis who made literary, cultural contributions on behalf of Apta.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorful Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the success of the event.
Declining profits of Bombardier as aircraft delivery, declining orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardir Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profits on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and less on contract issues as an air order and pressure by delivery.
Montreal-based Bombardir also did not present a update on issues that will be able to release any flight test data for his brand new CSRIs aircraft or complete its ambitious program to go to the commercial service from September next.
Approximately half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it's just been blown up three times, whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the share has been sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 sliding.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst share with the National Bank Financial, had reduced its rating for "regional performance" on Thursday, the stock is limited to the top between the next one or two quarters.
"Major aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with margin performance in transport," Dorsein said in a client note.
We'll get a new order for Bombardier Series as progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market program will be embarrassed.

New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal one side against the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Aclas School of Business in YouTow.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values while not working in the morning, but due to tiredness or excessive pressure in the evening, honesty decreases.
Researchers made two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left side or on the right side.
Participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
It was seen in this experiment that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, from 12 noon to 6 pm, while experimenting on people, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in mind.
With this, the researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Cocaine's accustomed lawyer who gave secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
42 - year - old Basharat Ditta informs notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The advocate felt that his confidential drug addiction might be known to the people .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by Liverpool Crown Court
The defendant's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid that people would know about his secret addiction of drug, three years of imprisonment.
42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising with his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to the infamous criminal Neil Scarborough about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was named "Bash", and whose criminals were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he had previous Narcotics Trial represented in the trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out with his colleagues for a law society dinner.
After getting the cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, its wallet, and its credit card, the investigation revealed that DITTA was a "regular user of A category drugs."
During the eight-month period between January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of Heroin and Cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people, who were sent to jail after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds during several impressions, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash.
42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because she feared that people did not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who was working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburnard, was facing mischief in the Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after three weeks of trial in Liverpool Crown Court.
He had accepted about keeping a cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started at that time when investigating Scarborough, the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Ditta from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping drugs with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at the Black Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that when Ditta's hair, wallet and credit cards were found to be clues of A category drug, it was found to be a "regular user of cocaine" in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said that his discussion was a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove his wallet and remove many credit cards, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his house along with his workplace, and his client used to call his house for legal matters.
After telling the arrested chiefs what the detectives knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the prominent people of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier presented the case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "The criminal advocate should know best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, joining his distinguished client very much.
We are not talking about the normal drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his talks must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of attorney-client relations.
He interrupted the investigation of the police as much as possible so that he could continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not honoring his profession but insulting.
He made a lot of close proximity to certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but rather I would do this work immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire police superintendent Lee Hallstead said that at the time Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself from criminal advocate to criminal.
Due to the addiction of his cocaine, he compromised a lot and became very weak towards the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and fill people with confidence and confidence.
Shri Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to avoid his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, showing our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This case should work as a warning for criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present it to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job will be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in America, his dinner guest of Mohammad Ali and inequality to be inspired for his work.

Thor ' s stories could show that there was no match for subtle tricks in cruel power , while the economic legends showed the significance of a dream .
In order to teach many of the myths, "exceptional far away wild and in some cases it will not be appropriate to teach in obscene and schools, Cross Lee Holland advocated "care selection" from one of the suitable works of the age."

The German media asked the FB to express hope to identify the presence of Listening Antenna and indicated a exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper , director of U . S . national intelligence , insisted that the United States should use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal  foreign companies ' business secrets and enhance their international competitiveness or enhance their bottom line .  s  Related Topics : US policy receive the latest by email : subscribe to daniel pipes ' free mailing list This text may be reposted or forwarded so long as it is presented as an integral whole with complete and accurate information provided about its author , date , place of publication , and original URL .  s  Comment on this item
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began to tell the treasure of his secrets to the American surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director does not follow his promise.
The U . S . National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras , and our cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , and Yahoo , expressed their fears about state monitoring .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also making potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should be awakened, Oliver Grn, the President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk like China, when it comes to stealing industrial espionage and data.
In all the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, there, however, there is no evidence so far that the US has to go to the business mysteries of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of EU Internet capabilities , and should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Trade leaders are doubting this about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
Hasso Planter, president of the German business software company SAP, "This is no way," said.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he would not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations highlighted by Snowden on American technical refinement and espionage access have proved to be a trauma for some companies , which previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing area where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive .
According to a survey carried out by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-American members canceled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after the disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP, says, "We saw a new question which did not come to the customers a year ago, is that where is my data stored And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming whether they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore they should be guarded at all costs.
It is not a surprise that there is economic espionage.
It has always happened.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed, Current Bock, the chemical manufacturer is called the Chief Executive of BASH."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we do , because it is in the national interest to defend our business .
Corporate leaders are usually not interested in the defense system and it is an advantage for the attacker.
For big companies, the message record has been going on for a long time, even if it is absurd to leave one in the house-to-house business with a bus stick, or leaving a laptop unintentionally in a hotel room is absurd to say at least.
A member of the board of lrich Lackenberg, Car Manufacturer Audi, says that this is a one-year-old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's B executive, when smart phones are compromising on foreign tours due to risk, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many of these companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access.
The US has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France the Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February named after Russia and Israel in the second tire of criminals engaged in hacking for economic intelligence behind China.
According to a board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when it comes to financial espionage, French is the worst
The former head of the French internal intelligence agency URI, in the interview, explains: "Services know very well that even though all the countries cooperate in non-terrorist battles, spy on their colleagues."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we do , because it is in the national interest to defend our business .
No fool made.
"The parents of Georgia's teenager killed in an unexpected accident believe that her son was murdered"
A teenager from Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, this was said by the family's advocate on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA was found trapped in a matt standing straight behind the bleachers in his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators of Laundes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was dead in a "unexpected accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Norp, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in death in the manner told by Sheriff.
The order said that "he believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and general intelligence."
They think that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of his son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag"
US Advocate General Michael Mullery said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he kill because of any crime
Murray said this in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth out.
He said that "I think there is environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that initial corpse tests indicate that Johnson's death resulted from static respiratory disease.
According to Moore, in a second body test, there was a different reason for death.
He said that "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the Landage County Sheriff's office.
On Wednesday, the Southern Georgian judge ordered the authorities to issue all the monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that the video footage will show some indications of how he died.
CDC issues Child Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines to control the food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time such guidelines have been issued by the US Government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergies.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergies in children have increased by 18 percent.
The guidelines indicate how teachers and staff should be informed about the food allergies of children, and how to handle any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep Apinephrine stock to face potentially deadly acute anophelesia - which is the auto-engagement of the Appen Brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of apinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms communicated by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is pricking in my tongue, "It seems that my tongue has hair, or "my tongue is swinging."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's sex undetermined
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will not be specified in a conventional manner.
According to the new law, parents do not have to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate of the child.
The objective of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can hasten decisions related to gender-specificization surgery for newborn children, and fight against discrimination against Intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will continue to be a wounded, stained obstacle made by the doctors.
According to estimates, one of the 2,000 children every year is such that there is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under the scrutiny of gender development disorders, it is a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals ( ovary or testicles), or abnormally developed gender.
Valis sympson may be intersex.
Gender identification is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify the sex when it can not be determined and to conduct surgery, if such a situation occurs, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Dresher, psychologist of New York City, who is an expert in gender identification, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good thing".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state like life-sensitivity, which requires surgery, but this does not happen with most children."
You can specify gender without surgery, and after that see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child, it is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about this why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, Intersex has been described as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to sex, but related to its biological composition, which is neither clearly a man nor a woman, but either a joint form of either or both of them are not clearly defined.
These features can display themselves in secondary sex characteristics such as weight of muscles, distribution of hair, breast and length primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs and chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by Intersex and Transgender Persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and partisan crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-corresponding gender.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark men, women or third sex on their official documents to adults.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry Me-Welby became the world's first recognized sexless person after winning a legal appeal to keep "unspecified sex status" for life.
According to the internal ministry, in addition to M or F in the German passport, there will also be third specification in the form of x for intersex persons.
According to a news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from Catholic countries have signed a petition to withdraw gender principles from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany's law saying, "When the world is going to such a situation, where gender is the option to be chosen by itself, but not sexual activity, we Two more pillars of civilization are taking in the opposite direction. "
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told the baby zone that she would like to see the children being specified at birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very tense without extra boundaries, especially if you do not even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, which was in the name of the beautiful Greek god, who was duplicate.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a slate, which could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes there can be a mistake from doctors, who do not know that children When they grow, what will they feel about their sex specification
Dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Psychological emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vague genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of the University of John Hapkins, who considered sex to be sophisticated.
He composed the word gender identification and argued how social and environmental signs - how parents raise the child - interaction with the genes and hormones of the child and determine whether it should be identified as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as "Jonzone", their principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex was accidentally sexed during the circumcision, to complete the baby and remove her testicles and raise her as a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of transition, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following the pattern.
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after the year 1990, people passing through these gender surgery started coming out, "The results are not happy."
The same case was with 36-year-old Montana writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the Y male chromosome, but his genitalia was unclear.
The doctors did not clearly understand that his penis was small, or his fugitive was big, but he was certain that he could never live a "consolidated life" as a man.
Therefore, after some time of his birth in 1976, the outer organ and testicles of the bruce were removed by surgery and he was raised like a girl.
She was given women hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I was not a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, Vaginoplasty was supposed to be with him.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the horrific truth.
I was tied at the time of birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains to people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, Annie Tamar-Matis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chippy and stigma".
She says, "Very active people feel that Germany's law will inspire parents to make quick decisions and specify the child "undetermined".
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We feel that instead of waiting, it is a better process to specify male or female sex.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Matis said that his organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender."
Germany's law is related to specifying it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Erlean Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law will provide "power" to both parents and children.
Baratzi's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full endrogen insensitivity symptoms.
Since there was a defect in his endrogen reception, women's characteristics developed in Katie.
There is a vagina in her body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Although she is inferior, she expects to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents not to make any decision in haste."
It gives them understanding and time properly by testing before writing, male or female.
In this way, you're fine - raise the baby, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not have to get such a surgery done in haste that can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the decision-making process and frees parents from the anguish that motivates them because they do not believe that they are curing."
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender she is more comfortable - and this will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Glo-in-the-Dark ice cream likes
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-the-Dark ice cream - using jailifish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came to him after reading a research paper on Gelfish and Chinese reliable scientists used the chemical glow to polish the protein again.
Ice cream, feeding with the tongue, will increase the pH level of protein and ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream is illuminated with reacting to the heat of the mouth , i . e . the more it lit , the more it lit .
Charlie, founder of the Lik MIM Delicius Icecream Company, said, "This is an incredible thing but the initial days' production will get me 200 to 0 grams of luggage."
The protein we're using in ice cream will react to the neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the Ph level and the ice cream will shine.
We have been examining for the past few months and seeming to be absolutely right to share it on heloven because it gives wonderful shining effects
This may be the most expensive ice cream that makes mean because the glimpse of geliphish is four times more expensive than gold .
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds .
Although Diska tastes very good.
Capne is famous for abnormal taste, including experimental company, beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf based in Charlie's Bristol.
But his next composition is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is naturally impossible because of the ice crystal which makes reflections over the ice cream, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of reflective properties of a geliphish synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market was stuck with the customers in the Rani Bagh market.
It was a matter of fact that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.

Something similar was seen at Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Sarafa shops of Model Town.
Here also people bought gold and silver ornaments and coins fiercely.
For this reason, there was also a jam in other markets including external ring road.
However, people from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.

Firefighters lowered the front part of the rock from the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death

George Keravan : Euro dissolution gave Scotts the option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of membership of the EU, independent Scotland would be required to join the entire Europe as an independent travel area.
Passport control on Barvik and indicate stories about the boundary of barbed wire on the headrian walls.
It is true that the Strathclide Paper describes the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not predicted in the headlines.
Nor did anybody describe that the EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer a Shangen area, Brussels will actually be cheaper for non-compliance Brussels instead of getting whatever he wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen. First of all, I had heard "independence" means passport control baseless news about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in repeating this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should we expect independent Scotland to bidding Europe
Why London's Yok should be bought for Brussels, especially now
There is real European news: The great, post-war plan of organizing Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe is officially dead.
In the entire EU, dedicated parties are strengthening to oppose EU or to close Euro in the form of a uniform currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscapetal Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and obtained nearly fifty lakh votes in the federal elections of September, and thus free democrats (equivalent to our own lib dams) effectively out of the Bundestag.
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be radical changer.
With the strict rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone far away due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The Euro crisis did not play a very big role in the high budget deficit of national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in the underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
European productivity is far beyond the current budget and currency problems.
In order to exempt French and German energy firms on consumer expenditure - as a result of the "Green Energy Policies" imposed by Brussels, the European industry doubled for electricity and four times for gas than the United Nations.
This is a paralyzing cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even freezing all wages in the world can not save the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of revolt is spreading among the people, especially in France, who was once the chief admirer of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany, and providing Paris equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is staggering.
Consequently, the right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-EU National Front, has won the victory by pushing the ruling socialist in third place in the recent by-election.
At present, the front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote - it is a warning to the British Labor that they can not follow that dissolution for the left, will automatically benefit the right.
Lee Pen is doing with French Gours, his new fame in the middle of the working class
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to create anti-EU, anti-cropping factions in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can first influence the European Parliament.
My vision is: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiments in Europe will end the Euro.
The euro will not be completely finished, but this retailer (sovereign) will return to any form of nations like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaulle.
Germany and some of its subsidiary economies can maintain the Euro, but France and Southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing proximity to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easy for non-federal nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while walking on the path of Norway.
In Scotland, the SNP Government - notably - has been the most successful anti-economic political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011, on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dam alliance, to oppose the deductions proposed by Labour's Chancellor Elister Darling and thereafter.
It will be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it will have to accept the rules of economics imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth before time: Growing early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get younger in comparison to their age-old girls.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near .
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a cause of puberty at an early age
The case of premature youth is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheriz is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts and genitals at the age of 7 or 8 years
This week, Dr Paul Caplovitz, a pediatric endocrinologist at the annual conference of the American Child Medical Academy in Orlando, Florida, clarified that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, these show new trends.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in reassuring parents - generally it does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as sprouting of breasts, genitals and gum hair and physical smells are seen in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first monthly religion).
In United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
When the breasts start developing then it takes at least two to three years for the first chemist to tell the caplovitz , who is also the author of premature youth in the girls : the guide to deal with this common problem .
The most accurate test time for the development of youth.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of youth, but when there is an increase in breast development before the age of 8 years, two are called "Bal-Adult".
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - whose pediatricians can closely inspect.
In case of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to examine the possibility of serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are remedies for delaying premature menstrual cycle and other consequences: premature aging of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and dramatic activity as adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthoodity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of medicines but accepts, "pressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls may feel different from their companions."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their young daughter to be a monthly religion.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and was upset that in his friends, he first started menstruation.
There are many popular principles about the causes of untimely youth.
Nevertheless, there is no continuous evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sexually transmitted messages in the media can be accused.
Boys are also getting premature youth like girls.
Caplovitz determines the rule that its main reason is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting studies on girls of 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects body fat with the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get youth before their age-old girls.
There are many explanations about this.
At the global level, the pattern of premature youth seems to be affected by all things ranging from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although the boys are getting the hair of face and genitals at an early age, but the youth is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other physicians attending the AAP Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even infants and children, it has become common to see pimples and genital hair.
Dr. Laurens Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at the Goryb Children's Hospital in Moristoun, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the actual beginning of the youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their paediatrician to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It can mean to negotiate before the expected time."
If you remain calm then your child will normally answer properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is a part of normal life.

Big orders of jet manufacturers at stake with a dispute for seat width .
There has been a competition for this month's Dubai arsho, setting up a rhythm for quarrels, among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights.
The controversy is focused on the width of the Economy class seat in long flights, not always like being given by Erlines, but its allotted space efficiency has been claimed by Latest Jet Arbus SAS and Boeing Company...
Erbus gives a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- semi -RRB- in the Economy cubin this week , expects such an industry standard but it should be decided by Erlines , its main opponent Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the 17-21 incident, there was a competition to sell long distance Ercraft's twin engine big varson from the possible recorded order.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - especially if the seating is 9 or 10 equal, keeping in mind the claims of more capacity, the designs of mini jambo jets are being prepared
Boeing says it ' s made 777  , which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 in one row in anonymity .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will leave 350 people in 18 inches and take them to 9 seats.
Aircraft giants often strike trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 777 , Dubai Arsho is expected to dominate more than 100 orders, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the beginning of the rebellion war has been anything, will you accept it together in a restaurant showing this to Finsero
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "Boing Regional Turbo" is also presenting a long distance flight in narrow seats.
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way to sit in the plane is not changed.
According to statistics from the U . S . Health Department , during the 1970s , when Boeing 747 Jambo One defined the modern long - term ki yatra ko , and the Century ' s ant me average 40 - 49 - year - old American males weighed 10 percent .
According to American Health Statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its opponent is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the new name Jet Set ' s average periphery was narrow .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission, which suggests an additional inch of 53 per cent improvement in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the Airbus seat measurement data , saying it doesn ' t depend on the manufacturers ' decision , how airlines have a balance between fares and facilities . . .
It also says that research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawer said that this actually tells what to do to give flexibility to the airlines and on those things which are confident that they need to do to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they benefit from.
They know better about their business than anyone else.
For flyers it is about the elbow room, but for suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect income.
Behind this controversy, there is an estimated  700 billion in trade, in the coming decades, the aircraft order competition is enough to tip the scales of US and European exports.
Reuters report said for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually an issue of fighting between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that every seat has been 20 percent of the work force, in the new twin engine design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 acres.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends on the comparison of 10 with 777 x of one origin 9 with 777 design .
The comparison has now been utilized with 10 equivalent benefits in unit cost.
Kevin Kenistan, Head of Airbus Passenger Facility in Europe says, "Boing's is doing this to capture more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat per line cabin is suggesting for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the dancing layout, which can go along with cheap rent ..
Cabin interior expert My Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network said that the eighteen-inch seat width will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of proposal 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to select suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors around the world also take care of checking this layout competition.
While resting too much, all builders are also giving high density layouts for low cost air services and regional travel of jets.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but says it is not sold yet.
However, unless recently, Airbus stressed on some of its jets in comprehensive cabin seats to need more cabin facility.
Modern jet planes are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer, but it can distract from the wave of 777  sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end smoking .
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was able to keep rats safe from nicotine addiction for the whole life.
There is a need for further testing before man starts testing, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that initial indications are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, But they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectly infects the liver cell, which after that starts making a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from getting the summons of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given mice, which were later given nicotine, continued to do their normal activities.
Researchers say that but the rat which was not given the vaccine was "good", it was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be given dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe then it can be given to the children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But possibly it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said, "He will know that if he starts smoking again, he will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in relieving his habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do a lot of research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not rise due to the actual cause of the death of the tigress.
The Forest Department, responding to this, is telling the death of the tigress in the first place naturally.
On Thursday night, the forest workers of Ramnagar forest division got the body of a tigress near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Nallah.
With all the parts of the body of the tigress being safe, there were no scars or injuries etc. on it.
In the presence of Forest Guard Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kaksha Nasim, SDO GS Karki, CTR's veterinary doctor Bharat and Kotabagh veterinary doctor Hema Rathore post mortem of the body of the tigress was done on Friday.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tigress is being told to be bad.
This did not detect the reasons for the actual death of the tigress.
On the death of the tigress, the departmental officials continued to respond.
Nevertheless, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for the hatsicological investigation to confirm the poison.
Forest Guard Western Circuit Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tigress can be called natural.
There are no symptoms of poison etc. from the body of the tigress.
However, with the search of the surrounding area, it is being sent to Bisra investigation to confirm the poison.
Tripodi denies us being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the policy of sea lease on the request of his political guru AD Obide, the patron of former New South Wales, AD Obide, who had hidden interest in the three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICA) detailed the investigation on Friday, whether Mr. Obide has renewed the rules of lobbying with several State Ministers for violation of the circulars of policy where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide were renewed without tender, after the expiry of its time in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, after the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the hidden interests of Mr. Tripodi Mr. Obide of the charge
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender for the lease.
Leaseholders were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi insisted on a change in the Government Lease Policy .
Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries of Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports in August and September 2007.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healy asked Mr. Tripodi. Was the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation on the development issue
"No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can not remember what I had discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighter planes attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter planes targeted Syrian port city Latakia on Thursday night , a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News .
The officer did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The report of the Associated Press shows that the target Russian missile was SA-125.
Israel has already carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice before this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can undergo " authenticity test "
The government is considering a "certification test" for foreign employees on 457 visas as it aims to expand a tough action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criterion designed to fill up unskilled posts in Australia or to prevent 457 used for delivery of family and friends in a thorough manner.
A Government Discussion Paper was issued today, condemning the government's words about foreign employees, former Labor MP Maxen McCu said today that it can provoke neighboring Australian countries.
He told the US Indian Institute today that "Foreigners are reaching the end of the queue and "Australian people have a very unpleasant repetition about the job before, at a time when the unions have demanded a safe labor market." .
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been protected - and I would not be surprised if some people in the region saw the sound of that historical evidence.
The Discussion Paper outlines 12 measures which were earlier considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brendan Okonar, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If "Authenticity criteria" is adopted, then the visa applicant can be examined in this regard whether "nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominee, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or the person related to the relevant person or a personal partner is.
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, because the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees, employed hundreds of people.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after coming to a refugee boat on Christmas Iceland this week.
The nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, an adult cousin tied the drum, which was on the same vessel.
Australian officials sent the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 rail project.
Work by US2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cremer said that this project will be "UK".
Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British government, who was talking to Scotland Transport, instructed US2 Limited to consider the possibility of improving rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Baronas Crammer: Our goal for US2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well added due to US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elister Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael to make a clear return to Scotland in the US2 network.
Mr. Brown said, "Scotland is likely to get huge economic benefits from the high speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire UK high speed rail case."
Therefore, we are excited to work in partnership with the British Government so that we can examine the options to bring high speed rail in Scotland, generate profit for all and meet the Glasgow-Adinburg line, whose Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the ministers of the British Government next year and to take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules will now be effective in Australia
In the US, due to the softening of equipment related regulations, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the US Air Services Companies open to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment during the important phases of the flight, provided they are in the "Air" mode.
Passengers can do this only during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Air Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Services Companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of power equipment are still effective in important phases of the flight in Australia.
"Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulation to control the use of power equipment in the aircraft, the authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operations companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the crew members. "
Virgin, who is already negotiating with the FASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he will take further action on the instructions of the regulator. Asked to do
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by FASA in the matter of allowing the use of power equipment, because we actually feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) It is in our planes. "
uantas said that it will now follow the existing rules.
It said that "According to our current policy, power equipment can not be used during flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it."
CADA decisions apply to American allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the decisions of the CAAA and the reasons behind it.
The effect of this decision will be different on each CSV aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air Services Companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio individualization from mobile devices and amend their rules books, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and brief details to the passengers.
CLAA said that after verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use lightweight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones on all heights.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to shut down their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper coaches while flying and landing.
Ponbrokers silver due to the difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
In the Bendemier Shopping Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by paying her gold bangle, ring and swing to pay her daughter's school fees.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have bought the house recently, so all our money is trapped in it."
She says that, although she earns  3,000 Singapore (US2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, but the monthly income of the family remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia where domestic credit is increasing - Valuemax, where they are doing their transactions, this week Singapore became the third ponshop to be listed on Stock Exchange.
The mortgage of ornaments is not the only way to get cash - in case of Ms. Amirthalinga, it is  1,300 Singapore dollars, but almost as insecure bank loans.
Generally, Ponbrokers in Singapore take 17 per annum interest, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent presented by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not having the requirement of credit scrutiny or proof of salary, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people are turning to ponshops in this area due to the rising cost of living by families and the increase in domestic and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial disaster, and after cheaper credit due to simple monetary policy in the developed economies, low and middle income families are approaching Ponshop to meet their requirements due to slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards and Purse, described the growing domestic gains mainly due to the growing mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic credit in proportion to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the technology recession this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a continuous recession of exports and reduction in consumer demand.
Song Seng Won, economist in Malaysian Bank, CIMB, said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, [the income scale] people coming from the middle to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way. .
Historically high values in gold values over the last two years have inspired people to mortgage personal assets as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family ornaments.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 pon outlets of City-State are gold.
People are saying, "The price of gold is feeling good, let's pledge the gold chain of the grandmother, and take back the next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Egyptian, has seen a 20 increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that outlet operator Valumax in Bendimer and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia. Planning to extend, Yah Lee Ching, executive director of Valuemax, says.
The company will financing it on the Singapore Stock Exchange using 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in the listing this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that there is not only affordable rates as compared to other mortgage lenders, but also does not directly increase the credit.
They say, the consumers mortgage things that they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic credit.
The social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponbrokers.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use Valuemax Outlet, they mortgage gold bars or rollex watches, which can get cash payment up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
Ms. Yah says, "They include wealthy persons who need loans for a short time for business enterprise or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements."
Sometimes they need money in just a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani's Wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
Many Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur to attend the party, on the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife poem Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously when such a big name joins the party, you can guess how big it will be.
 325 million rescue package for Tazi health
The Union Government has insisted that strict conditions are also attached to the  325 million rescue package for the health system of Tasmania, which will ensure that the state government can not ruin the fund.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the old population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the boundaries of the system.
The decision to financing during the four years was made after consultation with the Government of Tasmania with Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
Ms. Plibersek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the special challenges faced by the state."
The package of  325 million includes an alternative  31 million surgery scheme.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous collected cases.
This includes money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lansestation, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health recording system in local hospitals.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These investments are in line with the best ways I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania.
The Minister emphasized that Tasmania's government will face tough reporting and accountability rule.
The state will have to maintain the current financing level to get Commonwealth money, and report every month where additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the State serves as effective and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that the meaning of 325 million dollars will not be very high until real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sensitive level.
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope the federal assistance package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state public health system from the crisis-stricken list.
According to the state government, these additional alternate procedures will mainly predict the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Datton believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here for this reason because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You cannot be considered as a good news day by the state government taking about half billion dollars and giving 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth.
Shri Dattan demanded that Ms. Plibersek be guaranteed that no one of the rescue packages will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The transformation of the novel of Dennis Dederot by Gilom Nilox is a fine production design and time period description, but it has become more than it should have been.
Showing the time of France's 1760, this novel tells the tragic story of Sujan Nam Yuva Rais, which sends the convent to his family member.
When he revolts, he faces excessive cruelty in the hands of voluntary oppressor Mother Superior, and becomes a lucrative attraction for the other.
This film never goes into compassion or sensation - and this is the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the story description, there is also the risk of becoming a boring film for the audience.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons capability
The group monitoring on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while a fierce struggle emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war that started nearly three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organisation was made one day before the last date of 1st November .
Which the Hague-based organization had set up Dumscus to add chemicals to all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to destroy or "ineffective" machinery used to fill war materials.
Primarily the completion of the earliest phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Dumscus by mid-2014.
Destroying the device means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including Mustard Gas and Nurve Agent Sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is a chemical weapon production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which has described the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 civilians including 6,365 children are included.
On behalf of the government it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 are fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah is an extremist.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military team continued to fight the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people have been casualties from both sides, but clearly said nothing.
This war reflects the threat faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time frame.
A statement to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, stated that its team is still satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all the declared important production and mixing equipment in Syria in a devastated manner.
It also said, "No inspection activity is being planned next."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centers declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has proposed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, Director General of the Group Monitoring Group, Amhat Ujumku said, "I salute the determination and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission made by this organization so far.
This civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, which came out of Shia Islam, besides members of the sect, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory Chief Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion in the Air Defence Center in Latakia, the coastal region of Syria on Wednesday.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not known yet.
Police have recovered photo copies of fake registry, fake stamps, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused registrar used to collect papers from the records of empty and old land along with the clerk and recordkeeper of the office, and after that they bought new stamp papers and prepared fake registry on them.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, they used to offer fake registry records.
After this the accused used to sell the land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this the real owner of the land used to be a push account of police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
Police commissioner Gill told that the accused said in the inquiry that they have so far prepared fake registries of 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft are already registered against gangster Rajiv.
Indignation on the conviction of the bomb blast in Bali
In the year 2002, relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the conspirators of the bomb blast, said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran away as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building explosive devices used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the person who is called the infamous "demolitionary person" as a master who made the bomb was the death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the woman living in Perth, June Cortein, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told AAP, "They should be put in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
On October 12, 2002, at 11 o'clock in the night, after the explosion of the bomb loaded in the van standing outside the entire club, the nomination of this club was erased.
Peter Hughes was in the pedigree bar when the suicide bombers blasted the bagpack filled with explosive material just 20 seconds ago.
They went to a one-month long coma as a result of the bomb blast and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have been punished with the same punishment, which was awarded to three other members of Jemmah Islamiah terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Sea - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get 20 years of punishment.
Patek is the last person to be punished from Bali bomb blasts.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but ultimately in January 2011, he was arrested in Abtabad, Pakistan, where the US Army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden after less than four months.
During the trial, the FBI agent had certified that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really the sadness of bringing mental pain to so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtine said, "This year many tears will flow."
Still Patek can appeal against his penalties.
FA: Aircraft travelers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cell can not call from phone)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate to descending from the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - such a federal aviation administration on Thursday is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the administration.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircraft, new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training booklets and devices of their crew members to showcase the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already obtained schemes from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetblu are among the airlines who have already submitted plans.
In a statement, the FAA said, "Based on the status of the plan, we can approve the extended use of electronic device very soon.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to not start them till they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and allow them by the captain.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the aircraft lands, and do not start it until the aircraft is completely descended.
The FAA said, under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic barriers can allow their passengers to fly by plane, land and use the device at the time of taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher altitude, they are expected to meet these criteria.
The President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, Laura Glading has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - it will be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we have been bored by realizing like "hole monitors".
The agency said that but surfing by connecting internet at less than 10,000 feet, email exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be restricted.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
There will still be no talks with friends, an online scrabble-like game, the famous incident related to which is that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the airport at the gate in 2011, and he refused to shut down the device. When the American airlines had dropped them off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because due to their jump, the other person will be worried about injury in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be restricted during the flight.
The Federal Communication Commission has the regulatory authority relating to phone calls, not with the FA.
FAA can lift restrictions on some electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transport Security Board, who is the national transport security expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered as risks.
Rosenkar said, "Sail phones are really serious issues, but not because they can potentially interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they are in the air, Cell phones can interfere in towers. "
Industry Advisory Committee constituted by FAA last month has recommended that the Government should allow more use of individual electronic devices to investigate the issue.
The FAA has been pressurizing in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics like Sen. Claire McCaskilk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
It is becoming more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when FM radio and high-tech gadgets carried by passengers received reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment.
New airlines companies are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at the cruising height from the passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interruption.
Hurta said that most airline companies should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Electronic devices of today's time emit very little power radio transmission compared to the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, there is a nominal transmission during e-readers, page reversal.
But transmissions are dominated by downloading or sending data by device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favor the reduction of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said that he believes that the interruption of the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot should be allowed to shut down the device while landing in less visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them common knowledge facility of people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Do, CEO, US Travel Association, said that we are happy that FAA has recognized that travellers travelling with pleasure are not incompatible with safety and security.

The bird was left back in the jungle by air transport to protect from the North Sea Rig
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released from the coast by air transport in the jungle.

Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
The Business for Britain was launched in April and it was pledged to bring the business together and determine what changes we want to see with the UK's employment and prosperity manufacturers EU.
For that, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders who are representatives of UKs business size, regions and locations.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of the businessmen now want to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing while EU member countries are becoming stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not to engage in the long-term and vicious process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views about specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is more than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's trading sector - even a large businessman who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent agreed on this.
Finally, more clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move ahead with the EU on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was observed at the levels of leading business groups, demonstrated that businessmen are moving towards a "real change" that will give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - the conversion of treaty for Britain and the issue of achieving a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining the EU in the franchise.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: The survey is a gesture that UK businessmen support their plans to negotiate the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that businessmen expect to re-convert and make a meaningful change in favour of the UK to present power balance.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and very fast it is becoming mandatory, because Eurozone is stepping forward towards the affiliated economy and the fiscal federation.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businesses it means a new focused focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulation process of Brussels.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline a new round in Bulgaria

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two YMCA employees accused of sexual offenses, heard by the Royal Commission
Before being charged against Carringbah Child Care Employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with crimes of child sexual offences.
But in his statement before the Commission, he said that "ever it came to the notice of child sexual harassment within its organization, it was told to the Commission."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offenses, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offenses against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare, who assisted the Commission, said that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that external investigations of YMCA have been conducted and they have found YMCA at the forefront of child safety.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified and received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is accompanied by YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that due to the appointment of Lord, the management with me has failed and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their responsibilities related to informing of child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offenses with 12 children during a two-year tenure in YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to suggest that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report the violation of child safety by the Lord.
Whatever the employees saw about the violation, gave to the evidence that Lord spent time alone with children, personally babiesizing them, putting them in the lap, telling them that he loves them and giving them their mobile phones Includes playing on.
Daniel Ockwell, who was under Lord's supervision and had asked for child safety training, as he was concerned about his behavior, testified that YMCA, who supervised the Lord, was very threatening and difficult to meet the child service manager Jacoby Barnat for most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
He said that, rather his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his views to the YMCA NSW Mandal that, "Jonathan Lord was about not giving the text to the organization" from the incident.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the Secrecy Agreement by the employees immediately after the charges came to light, was done by YMCA's child service manager, Lium Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not "excited" and executed correctly.
Stephen Smallbon, Special Professor of Child Sexual Abuse of Griffith University, said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization.
He said that there were "grave problems" in the appointment, monitoring, entrance, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to become Britain's Prime Minister again - but he believes that there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
Restricting most of his comments to the role of representatives of foreign affairs and the peacekeepers of the Middle East Group after leaving office in June 2007 as a leader, Mr. Blair avoided discussing British politics to a great extent.
When asked if he would like to come back to the prime minister's post, Mr. Blair was presented by the Evening Standard newspaper in London saying, "Yes, sure, but this is not likely, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When there was a crowd of experts performing horse for the best horse of the year in Cardiff, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even in school and a few months away from taking his first step, the young child and his pet Shetland's Tattu Toffee easily completed three phases and won the top prize - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestion Centre at Rudri near Cardiff, there was a lot of appreciation for the display, behavior and style of the non-discriminatory pair which is only lengthy.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hat, she shook her flat hat on the alhad angle and made her two-year-old Toffee ring round.
Decisors praised Fenton for their natural skills to control which is far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given to Toffee on his third birthday as a gift in March last year, and since then he has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland daily.
His 30-year-old Ma Dona said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great pair."
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cups and rosettes.
This was the second opportunity when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy about his victory.
The most different in this colorland, it seemed so amazing to everyone that they wanted to photograph with him.
Ab Well, this small child of Nantiglo village near South Wales is running on the footprints of his Anti Sharon Howles, who has been displaying horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating and clapping.
He was running on the sand in the whole theater, and despite seeing so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a crazy animal - she loves horses, tractors and farms, and she has two chickens that she takes care of.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am sure he will perform very well.
An annual horse exhibition spokesman said: "Fenton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his stitch."
They are very good pairs.
The decision makers gave marks in view of the manner of performance of Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he looked really very different.
The arguing Chinese newspaper will be "renovation"
A Chinese newspaper, which had made an appeal on the homepage to leave a reporter convicted of defamation, will be restored, a press regulator said this.
Guangzhou's newspaper New Express gave a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a concocted news about the state's partially owned company.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through a complete improvement.
"The order of improvement came from the Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published many false reports about the listed company umloyon in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "Editorial management of the New Express was disorganized."
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by canceling the license of the reporter of "Chen Yongjau".
It had instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in the New Express and to revise the leadership team of the New Express immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles in the New Express, which blame financial irregularities in a construction-production company called umloyn.
After his denial, his newspaper published two pages appeal for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen came to the state television and accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV, "In this case, I have damaged the ability to win the confidence of the entire news media industry and the people.
I did this mainly because I had the greed of money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a mouthpiece apology, which said that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the broadcast of TV.
Experts say that from time to time, forcible accusations are made, despite this, in the latter half of this year, a law prohibited the authorities from blaming any person for blaming himself.

US-Mexico Drug Tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The US authorities have described the four-feet multiplication three-feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is equivalent to the curved length of about six football pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of similar godowns, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.

Taxes on foreign property owners will end London's artificial position
The Department of Finance has calculated the CGT measures in a provisional manner, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osbourne, who presented stamp duty at the rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and for persons who prefer to keep a house in a company rather than a separate person.
The stamp duty obtained from residential properties in Westminster and Kensington and Chellesa in the year 201213 was 708 million pounds, which is already higher than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hambur.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a fairly low tax on high-value property, which is not related to the effect of the old council tax system. .
He added , But this step was silent in buying property in London for some foreign investors and could reluctant to sell the existing owners . 
The top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which extends from Phulham to Wimbledon, valued in prime property, wealthy South-West London, grew by 11. 8 percent last year.
According to Savilles' research, the prices of central London continued to grow by 5.6 per cent every year, but the growing "growing" seemed to be slightly lower than the domestic market, because the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) The surge is being seen.
Scientists have highlighted further on the subject that what is the relationship between the movements of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tail mainly towards the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle difference of tail and react to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellartigra from the University of Trainto said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the stimulus in different ways which produces positive or negative feelings."
Here we have also tried to see it in other species.
He said that in the dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite sequence, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
In order to know more about how dogs respond to one-sided move by other dogs, researchers kept an eye on animals watching movies of other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their opponents sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We presented dogs with dogs' films - in the shadow picture to deal with realistic editions or other issues that confused, and we could see the movement of the tail and present the tail more left or right. Were there. "
When the animals saw an emotional dog moving their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they remained completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning direction mainly to the left (from the dog's point of view), his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, they do not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times from other dogs, and if they move their tail continuously on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you React on the basis of experience. "
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about the emotions of animals to the owners, veterinarians and trainers.
John Breadshaw, a dog behavior expert at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for the dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when the dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see the happy dog.
In another research in the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Until the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left than the right, it was more likely to reach near the dogs rather than being restless."
He said that this difference was because in various studies, dogs did not understand animals or robot dogs completely in films.
He clarified that it can help dogs to study the way they respond to real dogs.
"When there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and dogs are not exceptions in this case, he said. "
However, in view of the easy way their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their opponents sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow Gig due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys, a rock bank, has postponed Gig in Glasgow after suffering from the stroke of its main singer.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church has highest class priests, their post is below the pope, and they choose the pope, so Francis will represent the first group of individuals who will ultimately help in choosing their successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the Pope - it comes in the group of 120 cardinal electors.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the celebration of the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be organized, which is called the Pope-Sabbha.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell his decision to organize the Pope-Constitution of February so that it is easier to plan other meetings of cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Vallero of Catholic Voices said that by February there was a possibility of a reduction in the number of cardinal electors.
He said that the Pope generally declares the number of cardinal electors less than 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals above 80 years of age as per their wishes.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Summit will be important because it will be the first Pope-Summit after Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see if new popes nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance."
South America has forty percent Roman Catholics, but their number in cardinals is very low.
Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after the formation.
Prior to this, the Pope used to take the decision of all things automatically.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that "It is possible that Francis seeks advice from cardinals."
But we have not been in the past in this situation - it is completely new.
Valero said that usually the pope gives the post of cardinal to the bishop of big places, but Francis was completely surprised - so we do not know whose name they will declare.
GM calls back pickup trucks in the US to correct the seatback
On Friday, according to an information from US Auto Security Regulators, General Motors Company has called back about 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in a hand-held seatback in its new 2014 Shevarley Silverado and GMC Sera Pickup trucks.
There may be a reduction in the system of moving the front seat in some trucks.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto security standards about seatback, head restraint.
According to an information posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks started to be sent in June and this is the most important vehicle launch for the top US automaker after the insolvency renewal in 2009.
GM had told truck owners about this defect in the latter half of October.
The owner could not review the notification due to a 16-day government ban which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
The GM said on Friday that the sale of Silverado and Sera trucks which were redesigned for the 2014 Model Year had increased by 20 in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sera Pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the share of GM in the New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent.
Obama's voters scream of disappointment
I voted Obama twice in the expectation of change .
They say that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the GOP's blockade policy.
Obstruction policy can not excuse the problems of Obamacare website, drone attacks
Obama ' s 2008 campaign reminds of what could have happened .
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think it will encourage me during the second year's medical school's depression and awaken the ray of hope in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is a memorial of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get frustrated with the pamphlets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and the speech could stop your breath. .
Elections proved unilateral, and news speakers had taken a break to show the historical significance of that time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A team of young visionary people was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
While Obama became President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a tragic memory of lost opportunities.
There was actually a change after I voted for the first time.
Simply say that none of this could have imagined.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask, until Osama bin Laden is killed."
Besides, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many of our efforts to move forward: immigrant reform, public options for healthcare, shutting down of Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But innumerable times in which I favor the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition policy of the Republican is not an answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to the drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency to collect data about the personal life of the common American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of people who highlight the wrongdoings of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of Anwar L. Avalaki, a US citizen without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limits that are decreasing during the President's camp.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it can not pretend the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed in the Affordable Care Act Act.
I do not know if I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system can refute the political campaign that brings it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a prerequisite route, because the opposition political parties and random incidents such as the Newtown murder case will shape our public discussion.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be mostly elected by the administration itself.
This thing troubles you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidature.
Mith Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not seem to be determining his policies or his position.
I felt that another term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I miss the promises they have disappeared.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, describing how Pennsylvania Primary had a huge loss to Clinton due to Obama.
In a post-martam campaign meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they need to return to the track, and need to remain integrity on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Sir, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Moris.
Clive Pamar claims that PM Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday scheme is a struggle

Should the results of the election come two months after our voting
He said, "We should have a better system."
Why can not it be that we have a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of pencil to mark ballot papers.
That's because if a person does not like him, then can he erase him
It seems absolutely absurd to use pencil in today's era.

59-year-old Mr. Pamar said that his policies include the construction of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he will take his new work "very seriously".
Public post is for public service.
He said that "We do not want any other award other than the prize of history that we can serve the community at this important time."
The plaintiffs had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong displeasure over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the rapidly growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that the criminals have become unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.

RBI suspended two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Department of Exchange of Foreign Exchange (DoFEE), the information was received from two persons arising out of the case, it is another indication that the global scrutiny by the regulators in the suspicious manipulation of the currency market is progressing at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSF Barclage, Dush Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the regulators in the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day. Are there.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBI, who have been suspended with further investigation of the case appearing to be a recurrence of the Libor Interbank Debt Manipulation scandal.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is going on in this matter, and we are fully cooperating with CA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS was sent to the former trader and sent the records of emails and quick messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
This trader, Richard User, had left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European Head of Forex Spot Trading in JP Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, chief of European spot trading in the city, went on leave last week, while former senior currency trader in Barclause and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
People from the case told that the quick message group of Mr. User includes barclage and citigroup bankers.
The CBSE said that after the Swiss regulator, Finma, after being told that she is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, this week she has taken action against some of her employees.
At the global level, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority, VECO, CA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hague Paper Monetary Authority - Bankers are investigating allegations of misinterpretation in the currency market. Are there.
People acquainted with the case said that CSB, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse have also examined internal investigations, or have received requests for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely examining quick messages and emails for many years in search of clues for any wrong activity.
The news about the investigations has created a stir in the traders of such sectors who have been among the most profitable persons in the trading unit of Investment Banks for the past several years, but are facing the challenge this year, as there has been a reduction in opportunities for bookmakers due to low fluctuations in the currency.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
The senior trader said that despite the huge quantity of foreign exchange procurement, the fission of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by the banks means that "you can start affecting the market at a slightly lower ticket price. . "
This news came on the same day, on the day Credit Suisse announced the liberation of the trader from his Exchange Trade Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost nearly 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and collaborated with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said, "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the god of wealth Kuber and the death god Yamraj.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good and bad.
Good is our feeling of wealth.
The money that comes to the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than anything else, but the money that caused the ego has no meaning.
We should earn money with a sacred purpose and spend only for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the tendency of unaccounted collection or yen-ken-provoking earning money destroys our discretion, personality.
The spirit of donation should always be in the mind.
A portion of your money can also be the basis of someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible absence, we all should think for them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the masculines of life.
All people wish for wealth and luck and according to their pursuit, they also get wealth and luck.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is connected.
No matter how much a criminal becomes rich, he can neither consume it properly nor can anyone use it.
If someone else has money then do not envy him.
The true wealthy is the one who makes the way to flow in the numerous hands of money.
There can be no more use of money than creating employment for others.
Another thing, money is not in the form of currency only.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continues the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then half a dozen states will not get kerosene at these shops.
States where kerosene sales are to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the North-East are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, on two basis, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being made rapidly in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections.
In this regard, the Petroleum Ministry has made a lot of preparations.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped.
According to sources, kerosene quota has been reduced substantially to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand under this policy.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg liters to one lakh kg liters.
In the allocation of Uttarakhand, 70 percent of the kerosene quota of Haryana was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this reduction, there is no news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry is convinced that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
There is a difference of Rs 37 in the price of PDS kerosene and diesel.
This encourages those who adulterate.
In the states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.

Which party did what
If its comparative results come, then the country will not have the question whether the BJP government should come or not.

This country is witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food for two times.
But when the Congress or its supporting government was formed, it was not fortunate to fill the poor man.
Not a single Congress leader, a single UPA leader, is responding to what he did in nine and a half years.
Media people of our country can not even reach them.
The Congress has become egoistic.
They do not respond to media people too.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.

In Egypt , he believed in the first president elected independently .

Taken the oath of withdrawal.

He also said about his speech that there is no other sense in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be tackled.
The Chief Minister's face also had the same feeling that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to honor the workers in the Chintan camp and save them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
Although he had also said that he was ready to dismiss from the Cabinet to keep his point of view.
By the way, after the emergence of opinion in the Chintan camp, there is a fresh idea of setting up workers in government posts.
In the camp, State JD (U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of the nomination of workers in 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His signal was also that the list is almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will examine the list from his level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of legislators and MPs has been taken to make the list.
If needed, the list will be largely reshuffled to give place to old and committed workers.
The general allegation of MLAs and MPs is that the opinion of those people was not taken in the list of nominations.
The names of people who came after a long time from other parties have been recorded in the list, while many important activists active since the days of Samata Party have remained neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
In such personalities, a name also comes from Self-Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a small village of Chorwad in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in five siblings.
The five children of the family include Ramiklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumathi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started financially helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to plant a bhaji's shop near Girnar, the shop's income was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached Eden city of Yemen with a ship called Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramanikal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting jobs abroad.
But there was something else in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned to the country.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try luck by placing 500 rupees in pocket.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back again.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their sultanate.
Like father today, the names of these two brothers are also among international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was involved in his cabinet while being the Chief Minister.

I live in Shopian, who is called the stronghold of terrorists.
A security team of CRPF was posted at my house under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are also bodyguards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was going from my house, I talked to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate this matter.
Of course, in this context, when Kashmir's IGP Abdul Ghani Mir was contacted, he denied the information about this matter and said that this is a sensitive matter.
I myself will examine how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my information.

I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, unlike Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the tenure of Atal Vihari Bajpai's PM, there was a time when for two consecutive years (2001-2002) no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel. .
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high statue of 'Statue of Unity' in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Before this there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When asked about this difference from Manish Tewari, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertisement depends on many things, which include things like advertising size or advertising rate for that year.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Move through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Well is delivering free healthcare services to the rural areas of Cameron
Well and his team see hundreds of patients every weekend .
There are not many doctors in West African countries , there is only one doctor for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone in the top 10 to make the CNN year hero.
The winner will receive  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father coming to consciousness and going to the hospital unconscious, who were not properly facilitated to assist him.
Jamel Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased which spread to his brain, and he created anemia, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameron."
If we had money, then we would take our father out of the cameraon.
Instead, Well continued to revolve around the crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and got whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy."
You leave the house at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait in the mouth of death while waiting.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameron has only one doctor for every 5000 person.
If compared, then there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameron can not afford their expenses.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is from the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty."
And because of being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm resolve to resolve this.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have conducted 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Escovime, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not even with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once by pushing it from rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they actually get respect for the heroes: feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation that can be presented by the community.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause of celebration, and Well - with its big smile and endless energy - is happily involved.
The next morning, his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in each trip."
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificate - this document is required in school but many poor families can not afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local analysis.
Operations are usually done at school buildings, town halls or at home, after the process, the patient walks to the recovery place, and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work morning and morning on Sunday.
This is a compassionate speed, but the musicians of the village generally help in inspiring the party.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group comprising Cameron physicians and foreign medical students has undergone 700 free surgery last year and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One person said that due to free hernia surgery, she will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of my family and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around the yoke at night.
He said that this is his second job which financing 60 of his non-profit work, the rest is completed by private donations.
A second year medical student of Draxel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the group of Wells, Katie O'Mally said, "I do not know when they sleep.
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Medical and nursing students like O'Mally who come from United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity for them, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mally said, "In the surgical treatment we help in catching tools for Dr. Well or cleaning blood stains, we have been able to get experimental experience."
As a second year medical student in America, you will never get the opportunity to do this.
Volunteer students usually spend their money to reach Cameron, and they often come with the medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching Yonde, they come to live, and take the cost of instructions.
O'Mally says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Assisting other people to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I am very happy to do this work.
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.
Look at Escovime's website and find out how to help.
You may not be sure but this is true.

In fact, Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named it to express its displeasure over some of the bad roads in the city.

Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You see the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
He said, "Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer media questions."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to answer the public.
Clearly, Modi was answering Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an atmosphere of control where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate in front of him.
Modi said, "I promise the people of the country that when the BJP government will be formed in 2014, then we will present the report to the people every year."

He has become the first high-ranking member of the US Government, who has acknowledged that US espionage has crossed its limits, but has insisted that no rights have been misused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone a long way inappropriately."
And the President is determined to make it clear to the people and is still making a thorough review so that there is no misuse in any person.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasised that however, the NSA was working for a good cause and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
He further said: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves."
There is radical insurgency in the world, which is committed to killing people and killing them and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it occurs
We have actually saved the aircraft from falling, demolishing buildings, and killing people because we have been able to know about others' plans in advance.
In the meantime, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee of European Affairs said that the US manufacturers will go to Europe to help address concerns overseas about so-called US espionage and try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency, he is worried about the threats of prevention of participation by them in anti-terror organizations. .
Marfi, president of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee of the Democratic Party for the first time, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for the national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our anti-terrorist efforts.
To make European countries clear that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
The news of NSA recording millions of European phone conversations has brought bitterness in relation to some US partner countries, although the head of the agency said that these reports are not completely correct, and NATO reflects the misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations collected by allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden show that NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Agenda Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of espionage on allies and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the ruckus, Murphy said that his office is arranging a Congress visit which is likely to be this year, and he hoped that the delegation will include members of both the parties and both the Chambers.
The names of other participants will be released in the coming days.
He said that work is still being done on the travel program.
While Marfi said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "disciplinary relations" must also be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, their espionage programs used for years.
Marfi said, "Though we can amend our monitoring program to protect the rights of the European people better, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying. Are there. "
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit Middle East and Poland, where he will address malice from US Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to US Monitoring activities.
New politics of board changes has started in municipalities.
Recently, the team of Congress-led board councilors changed in the Saithia municipality of Birbhum district due to the change in the Trinamool board.

Some councilors of the Left Front, including the CPI (M), have also taken the flag of Trinamool.

Mr. Rai also claims that all agree with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join Trinamool Congress.
The qualified leaders of any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
Prior to the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of Congress councilors in the Saithia municipality, the capture of Trinamool on the municipal board is being considered as important in political circles.
Earlier, in the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Nadia, there is an example of the capture of Trinamool on the Congress-ruled municipal board.
In the districts, when the Trinamool is occupied due to the change of the party on the municipal board, those who join the party are welcomed in the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.

They say that those who break away from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
They claim that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fearing terror.
The CPI (M) is considering the change in the board of elected local bodies as a trauma on democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification for making a change in the matter of power.
