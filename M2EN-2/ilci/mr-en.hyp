The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going badly these days .
Due to global recession and the increasing danger of terrorism in South Asia tourism has become a serious threat to business .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan , which is counted among the major states of the country , has registered a special decrease these days .
According to the recently announced figures by the Rajasthan government in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
According to statistics number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . percent and number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 country and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 country and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , the director of Rajput holiday maker says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong infrastructure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the past few years have been good for Rajasthan .
This is the first time after 2002 when there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With respect to tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , bawari forest all are old to see the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments do big things regarding rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism but nothing can be done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
Along with this on foreign lady tourists the incidents of extinction and extinction of extinction have also put this state on an international level .
Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in this state for a long time but it was confined to papers only .
Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government regarding tourism .
With the aim of increasing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic form of tourism Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 AD .
This institute provides facilities like residence , food , communication , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one communication component and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels , but for some years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is expected to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this conglomerate is that even forty percent of its hotels have not been filled in the last five years .
Along with hotels other factors of the organization are also harming it .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists can not get attraction for this train .
Even after reducing the fare it is not able to attract tourists .
In the same way in the present year there has been a disagreement among tourists regarding the Mirza fair .
In 2007 - 08 the tourist village constructed by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stopped , this year there has been a gap in number and that is 217 .
One thing that gives satisfaction to this most RTDC was that there was no dearth in the attraction of tourists for Palace on Wheels i . . Shahi Agni .
This fire engine is proving to be beneficial .
Last year RTDC got the advantage of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
In this area of tourism coming in the area of tourism in Rajasthan the environment of anxiety is natural .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person has a desire to do something then he can take gold out of the soil .
Subrata Roy has proved this by establishing modern city Ambo valley in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
The dreams that they had dreamt of seeing them progressing day by day are filled with joy in their eyes .

Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .

On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Galle district are also historically important .
The ruins of the lakes of bricks near the Roing are still telling their story even today .
The ruins of bathing , being surrounded by pits on all four sides by concrete life and the ruins of wide roads are still singing the silent songs of our ancient grandeur .
You reach ero in four hours from upper Assam city , North Lakhimpur via Jeep .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts the hearts of the travellers .
This is that charming place where people of Aptani community live .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before becoming a road .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful Premrose , Wollet , Wild Current , Strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the tourists .
Apple and apricot are produced a lot here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of about 1524 metres .

With its untiring hard work the Aptani people have made it their heaven .
The farming of rice is very much here .
This place is a pottery of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of the hard work and skill of the farmers .
The requirement of iron ore of black river is fulfilled .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the slight redness emanating from the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snow laden hills of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
One also gets the feeling of wetness along with the touching cold in the environment .
With the sound of garbage below the feet one gets to see the layer of leaves stuck on the floor of the wood .
There is silence in the atmosphere and due to the spread of sunrise nothing could be seen more .
The vision blooms on the redness of the east .
I wanted to sit on a bench in the balcony .
As soon as the handles , the layer of ice gets tangled with a slight sound and the hands get tangled in a moment to feel cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , situated amidst these mountains laden with the snow of Switzerland this is the first experience in life to spend the night in this small village .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent in Geneva or around it .
Dat village settled on both the sides of the Balakhatti river is spread on a slight slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone valley on both the sides of which are situated several small towns .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the vehicles running on it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and half an hour journey of Karni - half an hour along the paradise of the Geneva lake and half a roan river coming from the east side meet in the Geneva lake near the city named Montreux which is called Lec Lemon in French .
Geneva city is situated at the western end of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves westwards .
On the right side beyond the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we came to the northern hilly path leaving this highway on the left side .
As the slope of the mountain is towards the south , the sun in the evening is giving it abundant glimpse of all sides .
Amount of snow above the valley is less here - almost no more than that .
As we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Even when good snow is frozen on both sides of the road then there is no special cold in the air due to the clear sky and shining sun .
On this curved hill juice after covering a journey of about 20 kms we reached a small village named Thel -LRB- Thel -RRB- .
Chalet -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - There are big multi-purpose bridges with descending roofs , fully made of wood .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , laundry etc . along with parking of cars .
Valaya is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes .
37 percent land of whole Cantonment was cultivated by grapes .
In the villages located on both sides of the Ron valley the gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the wineyards of grapes , roaming them around , resting in the night in the villages there and taking them to the shops of grapes tasting is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of wine made of grapes in a small fort built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to register themselves .
Once again we went through the same forest covered with dense forests .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the questions of children falling on the road for three to four kms .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come in sight on one turn .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the slope above the deep gorge a beautiful dome of houses is situated .
People are skiing in snow on the flat slopes situated in the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Snow falls all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
The same peace is spread here as well .
All around till the valley from the top of the mountain there is the empire of snow .
Within the next five minutes you reach a large round about in between that clock .
The name of Kasba is Leukerbad .
The population of Laukarbad located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and healthy people coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 bedded bedded bedded beds like 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bedded health center and 50 hotels for staying 1500 .

On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
A huge layer of snow is shining on the roofs of houses in the lukewarm sunshine .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the places found in Switzerland as a national heritage .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to the taxis of Sikkim therefore chewing does not happen .
The journey is on , whether the state is on the other side , but the mountain is on the other side , the trees are on the other side , the wind is on the other side .
The hail that flies on all the body is the same .
In the season of monsoon there is a thrilling hustle-bustle .
Just as the plan for Darjeeling journey was fixed it was decided to take a glimpse of Kurseong first .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea estates , full of smoke .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move ahead from Siliguri towards Darjeeling then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming here smiling .
Going through the road going through the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On the one side the green mountains full of forests , on the other side deep green valleys .
Sometimes jungles and tea gardens are visible here .
All around there was an empires of greenery .
Once upon a time I got upset seeing these natural jungles that we saw tea plants laden with humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful forests are the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If one gets to see the road on the way then the creation appears magnificent .
Walk and circular roads like snake charmers were moving ahead .
Time was also spent .
If it was not finished then it was forest and tea garden .
Sometimes small settlements were visible .
From a distance more dense than a mountainous house etc . have been seen .
It was Kurseong .
Staying here at one place we made a program to roam around the whole day .
That is why we set out on a tour of Kurseong with a car .
First dire park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Even though Karsiyang is full of beauty it has not been able to develop and fame in the form of a tourist spot .
While the city is very good and clean .
The joy of reaching till Deer Park surrounded by jungles despite being desolate road and climbing through smoke trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
On the other side of this city is a pond situated at a height .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
At present there is a park and a hotel here .
There is a jean-like monastery here from the height of which on observing the whole city a beautiful scene is created .
In the tea gardens nearby women were stabbed in the tea gardens by putting a hat on their backs and running their hands in a hurry .
There is a museum outside the Karsiyang city but on that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to tour the dense environment of tea garden .
The next day it is certain to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was a bigger concern than this that if it continues to rain then how will we move 
But coincidence was very good that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed the sunrise very happy .
This park is a very attractive place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On going a little below from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls located in the rocks here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are very beautiful in the empire of rocks and rocks here , while in Ganga Maya the maidens of the waterfalls are decorated with stones .
Both of these places are sitting very low between the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling after getting up with the help of a car .
From here on the basis of binoculars the whole mountain of Darjeeling and city can be seen .
The waves of the weather were clean till now .
But as we went towards the monastery , the fog did not seem as if we had come and started spooning .
In the evening plans were made for roaming and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling toy train enhances the beauty of the journey .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Ghum and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lakes and halt in the park here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar through this route , where sweaters woven with Nepali artisans etc . are available .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but there is abundance of jungle - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Apo and Lolegaon , which is full of forest - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had just come to Darjeeling from Kolkata .
My current short journey was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor outside Rajasthan but very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes a journey attracts you towards itself , sometimes a special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people get attracted .
The place I will do is prepared only four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has really done the welfare of the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide Rambabu swings in my ears . Sahiba could not even think before this that we could stay in the jungle like this .
50 percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did n't get work in heritage hotels either .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before and now in this unique royal prediction is in Aman Bagh .
He brought the swimming of his speech into a new color .
Sahiba ' is an ideal place for peace .
Nobody speaks to you in English words there .
Aman Garden is really a picnic spot with peace , peace , happiness and all happiness .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces itself to the surrounding region .
In the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people must have traveled to Bhangadh of Bhutan .
After the opening of Aman garden large people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had spoken to me there heartily but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh after wandering on his own .
This time when suddenly I reached there with the help of my foreign travellers then it felt as if people want to spend a good holiday in a short span of time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden among those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt .
Its construction was done in twenty one years .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Garden surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees attracts you .
The way you are welcomed inside , the way you feel that divine peace has been taken care of here .
Along with making valuables in Mangat the life giving pronunciations of Mangalacharya is also done .
We had reached after evening and decided to kill that garden .
My host Jackie , who is a decorator , said easily . This is exciting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bag has received the award at present .
The administrator fixed our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangadh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbagarh on which gradually the rays of the sun used to spread .
Seeing the dry lake in which the farmers used to cultivate .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw the farm of tobacco .
For Jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Halland sitting in meditation .
This is a priceless moment of millions of dollars .
They gave us a break by giving us traditional , jaggery and curd .
Now it has been seen that why tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that for seeing the life of the tribe many tour packages are kept .
Is it true 
Undoubtedly and not only this happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to discover such a place where there was not much development and where there was no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
That very place where old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing all the tridial keys .
Actually the aim of such tours was to make the tourists aware of the way and tradition of living at that place .
Although this idea seems a bit difficult , but such tours are really attractive and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone despite being with many people .
Not only this in this journey you can give more time without interrupting your favorite book .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with giving less expenditure and comfortably a lot of time these tours definitely keep an expectation of patience from you .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching any foreign place with the help of bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , militia senators , daughters and others get suits on these , then for two people there is arrangement of giving suits as well .
However , it is cheaper to buy booking tickets , so at the last moment it is better to do a little quicker than planning a bus tour .
Instead of towing tickets get information about round trips .
These are cheap .
The rules regarding bagge are specially stringent , therefore ignore the shape and weight of the luggage .
Never let it happen that you will have to leave some of your things on the terminal or you will have to pay more fees later .
Also understand the rules of insurance or compensation from tourism company .
Carry on bags are right , take them .
Because they sit right in the rock above this seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of luggage is on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you should pay special attention to this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better the choice of seat will be with you .
Keep in mind whether it is comfortable while choosing the seat .
If the heart beats more on the back seat , then the reading on the next seat is not conferred .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take the seat of the elbow and if you do not like too much obstacles then the window seat will be good for you .
Now it is a matter of circumference .
If you both are thinking of shouting then first sit on the seat of the elbow and keep your bag on the second seat .
If there is not much crowd in bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing as well , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make the identity of the bus driver and conductor .
So you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because they do not take the responsibility of sitting on the back .
Wherever the bus stops return back on time .
If you do not come in time then your place will be available to other people and you will have to wait for the bus .

After that even if you stay in Malaysia you can get hotels at a little lesser rate but if you go to any island around to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be very small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Actually due to some difficulties Louis Cruise has now postponed its service , but there is a possibility of its resumption from October .
On Louis cruise ship MV Aquamarin you can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at a rate of every night .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two grow older then complete free for the child of less than 15 years of age .
What else should be there 
Tea , breakfast , food are included in the cruise fares .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives with the help of your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a single plane stands in front of you while flying in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this 12 - 15 seated television oter aircraft is excellent for roaming Maldivesarkhand island .
Walking like a speed boat from the surface of water he never understands that he flies in the air .
In the entire journey we do n't get the feeling of the journey of normal planes .
Our eyes continuously keep on moving beneath the window while paying attention to the different shades of blue water of the Maldives , desert islands and desert islands .
Everyone looks so clean .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of the only companies with 20 aircrafts .
If you want then you can travel by air for an hour for about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- everyone -RRB- or you can take the entire plane by rent throughout the day -LRB- just as full -RRB- .
If we go to any island other than Male island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on different islands .
And this is such a journey that we do not want to end .
Maritime aircrafts travel from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- north Mavilewaru -RRB- to Maldives island .
We were in the biggest ancient and sovereign shops of the capital in the Ahmadabadi market of Male .
All the sellers were listening to the address given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen one day before .
To say honestly, I have not seen any Indian listening to the President or the Prime Minister's address so carefully.
But when there was a question of the existence of a supernatural thing on this planet then such a seriousness was natural .
Many people might have understood the meeting taking place inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it feels as if the nature ' s wrath has taken it away from you then the world will be disturbed .
There is something special in its beauty .
There is not so much beauty in that small country .
After that journey of the market if we return to the cruise after returning to the port then if our eyes go in the water of the sea then it feels as if the people here love beauty .
The water was so clean that the fishes swimming underneath in the lamppost can be seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see a few centimetres in the water of the sea or river near any city of India then you will consider yourself a king .
While returning from M . . . aquarium two hours of evening spent in Malaysia gets filled with thrill .
Naval Stone -LRB- moong stone -RRB- is the life here .
So much that we will get to see mute stones on the rocks on the graves .
On hearing the address of President Nasheed for some time we were standing beside his official residence .
It did n't seem that we were standing beyond the dwelling place of one of the highest personalities of the country and there was no security guard on far off places .
We enjoyed taking photographs of only fifty metres long gardens and barbicans inside the gates of their bungalows .
Can you think about the house of a leader of India
It was also understood that the President sometimes crossed the road on his own and reached his office two houses ahead .
Everything in the context of Maldives was enhancing eagerness .
That is why I waited the next day in a hurry .
It seemed that the day would have been special .
In the morning a name from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we roamed around the runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when the cruise reached near Mala then we immediately got to know the plane going above .
We had seen so many photographs .
But then it was not imagined that next day it would get a chance to roam around .
We had to go to Rangali island one hundred five kilometres long by the sea plane of Trauss Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see hundreds of waterfalls and islands spread on the sea of Maldives by the sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
With thrill and enthusiasm one gets to breathe .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hillton Hotel in Rangali island it felt as if we have reached a different world .
In such a world which has nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such relationship that it was not possible to get out of beauty and comfort like that .
The journey of Konark can also be done on foot or by a battery train as well .
On going till the main island from the harbor the scene of water on both the sides of the bridge becomes unique .
Now we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
While descending in the water below the Sumudra several metres below the rocks we went to such a depth of glass which was in water .
Our room was literally a dining room .
Crossing the glass everywhere we were able to see unique types of small fish , fountains , snorekelling and scuba diving manse .
The idea of eating sitting on the tables there was totally thrilling .
For coming to this island by sea plane from Malaysia and taking lunch inside water the expense of a person is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in water .
But it was known that it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we turned back with the hope that sometimes Nashib would come back to this place .
It was decided to go away from Delhi for several days but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife had a fondness , then thought that do not let go of Jim Corbett at this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking till Pegong pond near Khardungla in Laddakh .
In the afternoon 27 we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but with the enthusiasm that had come out our speed was boiling .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Wash off and a bad road ahead .
Many a times it seemed as if we had fallen .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was slipping near the park which we had already registered .
On that day there was no special program but despite being cold we went for a walk on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we went to see the Corbett Museum situated near Dhangdi Gate at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
A lot of evening happened while returning .
While leaving Delhi we decided that the lion roaming freely in the jungle will surely be able to see it so that I could see lion in the dream of the whole night .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly heard a terrible dawn and after that the dogs began to bite that which did not stop for two hours .
Earlier Kaldungi and Corbett waterfalls were decided to be seen .
Kalatungi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett Fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kalatungi where some important items related to his personal life are kept .
Till return twelve o'clock .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place Jim Corbett had settled in this village .
On reaching the resort the tourist jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for sighting in the Sight Business of one number there .
Asked about a number , they said that there is more greenery there and tigers come to protect themselves from the cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two tortoise elephants inside which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking for the tiger .
Guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park some of which have died .
At some places we also saw the tunes of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a lion 's nest on my head .
Then I remembered a friend of mine .
I put that same phone on him .
I told him that I had come in carbonate .
Watching the tiger he asked .
His words are like arrows .
I spoke slowly , no .
There was no permission to take bikes in the park .
Someone told us that you should take a safari to go inside .
