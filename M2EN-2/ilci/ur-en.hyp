Their tongue looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side there is a mixture of both synthesis and on the other side in Gujarati language as well .
This is called ' kanji ' .
As such this is a ' word ' , it does not have its own original form .
If something has to be written then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Near Bhoj is that wonderful city where many times the whole city has been devastated .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very interesting .
If we return by the way through that route then we will have to take a month 's holiday and take a holiday and here in Mumbai school will be opened .
So , will you now travel by train calling the fast buses of Gujarat Tata 
The small train of metre gauge from Bhoj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metre gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan is passing through these two wide distances .
Due to the increasing threats in world temples and south Asia tourism has deepened .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country these days has been significantly reduced .
Fresh statistics released by the Rajasthan government recently show that in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than 10 percent as compared to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 364 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 918 thousand 918 lakh national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 25558691 foreign tourists and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism department are very worried about this situation .
The director of Rajputana Hill Marks Sanjay Kushko has said that the incidents of world medical and civilization have affected the tourism industry badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare a strong basic structure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent as compared to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
The tourists of France are the most among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism recent years are the best options for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , fences , jungles , all are very old to draw tourists .
In the context of tourism all governments do increase in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done towards it .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with non - national women tourists the recent years of life and struggle have also made the importance of this state observed at international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry to the state but it remained confined to newspapers only .
There is an example of the success of Rajasthan government regarding tourism , Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of boosting tourism and promoting the basic infrastructure of tourism in Rajasthan Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of lodging , comfort , comfort , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one dharamshala , one dharamshala and two trains palaces on wheels and the condition of Royal Rajasthan on wheels are also made thin for many years .
The area of RTC in 2009 - 2008 was 185 lakh , whose year 2009 - 2009 is expected to be 632 lakh .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even 40 percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled in the last five years .
Along with the hotels other factories of the corporation are also bringing it into consideration .
Among these the main are the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this train .
Despite losing their fares they did not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2008 - 2007 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist villages made by RTDC this number decreased to 217 this year .
In the midst of all this it is worth mentioning for RTDC that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the Royal Garden .
This train is continuously making profits .
Last year from this rail RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 95 crores .
Worrying lines in the field of tourism are natural to be seen from this fall in the tourism department of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the history of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his heart then he can make a sleep of mud .

The temple of Tamareshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient stories one gets to know the great archaeologist of Tamareshwari Devi .
During the period of the Chetia kings there was acceptance of this goddess in the mountains of north and south .
The tribes here used to worship Goddess .
Human sacrifice was also given here due to which later Rajagorinath Singh had stopped .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohat district of Arunachal .
They are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the midst of the Debang and Debang rivers .
According to the popular cities here this place is the old Vidarbha where at one time the royal family used to rule .

We reach ero from 4 hours to 4 hours through jeep from Norath Lamapur , the city of upper Assam .
This place is the headquarter of Laur Sobansari district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place captures the heart of the people coming here .
This is that charming place where people live .
It used to take several days for the jeep to reach here before formation .
On reaching here high deodar trees , beautiful deer , wild cat , wild cat , strawberries and juicy views hypnotise the tourists .
Apple and pomegranate are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kms .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the tourists .
With their hard work the companions have made it their heaven .
The field of rice is very good here .
This place is a treasure of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of his labour and struggle for farming .
Its climate is compensated by Kali Nadi .
The pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the slight redness emerging in the sky on the summit just in the middle of the mountain ranges covered with snow of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the cool breeze blowing in the atmosphere one also gets the feeling of moisture .
The sound of raw raw below the legs is seen on the layer of a layer spread on the wooden floor .
There is moisture in the planet and nothing is visible because of the darkness before sunrise .
The sights remain stuck to the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on a bench in the balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the spinal cord rubs with the sound of mild wrinkles and the hand separates from the clutches of the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third place in Swiss .
Before this most of the time was spent in Geneva or around it .
On both the sides of the river eating thin streams the dense population settled in the valley is spread on very high slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Honey on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
The luxurious highway of the Ron river and the Ringti cars have been clearly visible on it .
A half an hour journey from a distance of 300 kilometres and a half an hour journey from a car is found near the city named Rondie Montro which is known as French -LRB- Lackima -RRB- coming in the eastern direction along with the comfort of Jenuiah lake .
Geneva city is settled on the western end of this 300 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the lake moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side across the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhaul , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
Crossing the city through a beautiful valley named Leuk we leave this highway on the left side , come to the northern side on the mountainous path .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards south the sun is giving a complete sunshine to the corner of the evening .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less , almost equal .
Like life increases towards height , amount of snow starts increasing .
Despite the accumulation of good snow on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 kilometres on this roaming hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal -LRB- Hel -RRB- .
There are many big storied bungalows with slopy roofs , completely made of wood .
In the basement made with the cement concrete of this bungalow of three storeys there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , laundry along with the parking lotion .
William Switzerland is famous for its fields of grapes .
This is a special center of making wine grapes .
On 37  land part of the entire cantonment there is field of grapes .
The gardens of grapes in the village based on both the sides of the Ron valley provide a unique experience to the beauty there .
Take the gardens of grapes -LRB- Wineards -RRB- , tour them , rest in the night in the village there and take them to the dry gardens and drying -LRB- Winesting -RRB- is an integral part of the tourist beauty here .
There is a very big museum of thumb made in the 12th century in a small town named Aizawl to see which foreign tourists have to first booze .
Once again we pass through the middle of the deserted forest from Dawal .
Mind gets worse by the questions of children going through the road for three to four kilometres .
Suddenly a fascinating and charming change comes in view of a turn .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on the Spat slope from Upper of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of Upper mountain from the skiing slope .
Snow falls on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses of the villages are shining because of the falling sun rays .
In five minutes we reach Us village .
Here also the same folk songs have been displayed .
On all four sides from the top of the mountain till the slopy valley there is the reign of dusty snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach the middle of this town by a large circular fountain -LRB- Wondabuot -RRB- .
The name of the city is Laukarabad -LRB- Yukerabad -RRB- .
The population of Laukarabad situated at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is approximately 1500 .
It can be estimated from the number of tourists , acquaintances and medical experts coming here that there are 1700 apartments and shells -LRB- 1500 -RRB- hotels for stay , camping sites of youth , centres of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 tablets of hot water have been found in Laukarabad till now .
Out of these 40 lac litres -LRB- up to 51 h . . -RRB- reaches Hermal Pools -LRB- Hermal Pools -RRB- built at a place in the entire water colony everyday , some moments are inside the five star hotels and according to the pockets of different commuters .
Reaching the village one feels extremely hot .
The thick layer of snow is glittering above the roof of the house in the skinny sunshine .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Belenin village is one of the preserved places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that in Sikkim cigarettes can be taxed only hence there is no checking .
Travellers are going on , there may be other provinces , but mountains are the same , trees are the same , they are the ones which are the circular .
The moisture carved on the whole body is the same .
In the rainy season the season of Summeri is the same .
On the completion of the program of Darjeeling journey the decision to take care of Karsingh was taken first .
Crossing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea estates , full of dry jungles .
Famous for production of high tea .
Moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , at the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the people moving towards themselves .
Passing through the roads amidst tea gardens wins the heart for the first time .
On one side the green mountain covered with jungles , on the other side deep green trench .
Sometimes the jungles here used to be seen tea gardens .
There was the rule of greenery on four sides .
Once upon a time we got greenery , on seeing these natural jungles or tea plantations planted by man .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The more beautiful was the jungle , the more beautiful is the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you look at the roads on the way then it seems strange .
The movement of the snake was getting twisted and narrow .
Time was also passing .
It was not passing , then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance only one hill house - house etc . appear very dense .
This was Karsingh .
Staying at one place here we made a program to roam around the whole day .
After taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Crossing .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by thick forests on all four sides .
Upper i . . to reach the deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being charming with the beauty of Karsing one has not yet been able to get popular in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very high and clean .
Despite the road being dense the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road amidst the sunshine was making us comfortable .
The next place was England Creek .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicidal point .
It is said that during the reign of the British lovers people used to live by jumping from here .
Currently this is decorated with a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase here on the height of which a beautiful view of the whole city comes in front .
In the tea gardens nearby women used to be busy breaking the tea garden running very fast on the back .
There is a museum outside the Crossing city , but that day we could not go there , because it was more necessary to tour the charming environment of tea gardens .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a charming experience in itself , but it was a big worry as to how would we roam if it rained .
But it was very surprising that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed sporting sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more attractive than this .
On moving a little more below from here we met Ghera Gangamaya from the hills .
Here amidst the rocks the beauty of the waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the reign of Pithora and rocks are frozen here then the climate of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are located very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Baisia loop in Darjeeling after lifting up with the help of a car .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durban .
The climate was still deserted .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we come down and shouted .
In the evening there was a program of strolling and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling tour the tour trains enjoy the journey .
The journey of tour from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and from Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Araku lake and a little rest in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where sweaters made by the hand of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its shape is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but the hustle-bustle of forests and waterfalls goes on .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which is filled with forest waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not find Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata , touring Darjeeling in the shade of winters , tea gardens spread from Shillong to Darjeeling tied me with ourselves .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and charming .
This journey was not of non-country and not of outside Rajasthan but of very close proximity to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing in itself , in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , ship of water or some other city like royal train or a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people start pulling .
The place where you are going to talk is ready just four and a half years back , but the place with which this place has come here has really turned into jungles .
Not only for those going there , but also for those staying there .
My guide resonates in my ears with the words of Rambabumana , before this we could not even imagine that we could live in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people could not even work in the heritage hotel .
Rambabu the resident of Pahargarh used to work in Jaipur before this and now this unique royal style is in Shanti Bagh .
He has embraced his own speech in a new color .
Peace is the style of peace .
Nobody calls you English .
Shanti Bagh is actually a peaceful tourist place with all the conveniences of China and Pakistan .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it gives you company from the nearby areas as well .
How many people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan will be able to tour Bhangra of the brothers .
After the opening of the Shanti Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as well when Ultimately I had called me there heartily but I had not gone .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Mangdeh by traversing the way .
This time when suddenly I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guests , then it seemed as if those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time then they should definitely go to Shantibagh .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to hunt .
Its construction was done in sixteenth century .
Its old wall is witness to these days .
The first glimpse of Shanti Bagh draws you in the shadow of mountains surrounded and dense trees .
As soon as you come in the way you are welcomed , it seems that here spiritual peace has been given great attention .
Along with binding the pearls in the pearls the peacock feathers of Mangalore are also made alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we decided to plant a cycle of this garden .
My wife J . . , who is a decorator of a decoration , suddenly got up , it is interesting .
All are influenced by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything new but artistic . No wonder that Shanti Bagh has received prize in recent times .
The manager organised our program for getting it done in the morning .
First of all a walk with Rambabu and then a journey of the jeep of Bhangra .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Jaigarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were farming .
This year it did not rain but for the first time saw fields of tobacco .
For Jaiki there was such a unique experience of the life of the village .
After that we reached Bhangra from jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar invaluable bridge .
The way of saying goodbye to peace is also traditional thunder and by opening curd they made us leave .
Now we understood that why tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are kept for showing Tribal Life .
Is this right .
Learning and not one such happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
In it stale , food etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to face such places , where very much development has not taken place and the lifestyle of nature and people have not had any special effect on time .
Along with this old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this attention is given only on taking a transitional consciousness .
Actually the aim of such tours is to make the tourists aware of the way and style of living of this place .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people from it you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to destruct your favorite book .
Yes , it is very important that along with giving less expense and peaceful full time this tour will definitely take pleasure from you .
This is the reason that for enjoying them it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching any other national destination bus tour .
Find a best deal before taking a ticket .
Scientists , senior people of milletry , children etc get a discount on them , then there is a discount for two people as well .
However , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to feed bus tours in the last moments so that you do plating a little before .
Instead of two wheelers know about round trips .
It gets lethargic .
The arguments regarding the bagge are very tough , therefore ask about the shape and weight of the luggage .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or have to pay a different fee .
Also know the solutions of insurance or loss from tour company .
Caribbean bags stay right , take them away .
Because they come properly in the reiki above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of luggage will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During adventurous season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better the seat will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If there will be more shock on the seat then the seat on the seats ahead will not be comfortable .
If you have to loot again and again , then take the seat with the corner and if you do not like to be more distressed , then the seat with the flag will be better for you .
Now there is a trick .
If you are both in the clutches of the palm then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the planning will be successful .
If there is convenience of vasram in bus , then while enjoying the seat also keep this thing in mind , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identification by bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its coming the bus does not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can find a new traveller at your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome has not been seen in Europe then nothing has been seen .

Located in Pinji the capital of Goa , Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western shore excellent .
Taking full enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold sea climate and world famous Goan food on Goa roads the enjoyment of comfortable days is the best option here .
If seen in today 's history then for Maldives the cheapest person is of 28 thousand rupees per person .
After this if you stay in Malayala Kalagramam then you can find hotels at a little lesser rate but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maladev then the pocket will be small .
Screens prove to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Loi Cruise from Kochi started the united secretariat of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Loi Cruise is a European company and there is a very popular village in Cruise and Hotel Beopar .
Although due to some problems Loi cruise has stopped its service now , but it is expected that its water pump will start from October .
At least 5850 rupees per person per hour can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the Loi Cruise ship 's MV aquarium .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two years are old then children of less than 15 years are absolutely free .
What else should be done .
In the fare of cruise tea , breakfast , food all are included .
The entertainment of all the time together .
On reaching the capital via your pocket you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives from - seapline till underwater lining .
If a sepulchre is suddenly standing in front of you while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this tin oteroplane with 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming like Maldives orchipelago -LRB- idolaters -RRB- .
When does it get up in the air while running on the surface of the water like a spider boot , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not have the idea of the blow of ordinary airplanes .
At all times your signals keep on slipping through the windows - the blue water of different shades of the Maldives keeping an eye on the reserve islands and the coral islands .
Everything looks so clean .
There are only two sapling companies in Maldives .
Transplant goddess is one of them with 20 saplings .
If you want you can roam around an hour in a person -LRB- about a thousand rupees -RRB- or you can hire a pocket for a day 's entertainment -LRB- without pocket -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from Mala Island then it will be necessary for you to travel to Silen because this is the only way to travel amidst different islands .

The journey from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- excellent Mavilivarao -RRB- of the Seplains takes place in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and square shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Malaysia .
All the people were listening carefully to the suggestions given in Copenhagen -LRB- Copenhagen -RRB- in the first day by the chief minister of Maldives II .
Saying sincerely I have not seen any Indian listening to the question of president or president so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a rare creation of this struggle then that much seriousness was essential .
Many people may have understood the misunderstandings done in water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it feels as if the natural calamity snatches it from us then how bad will the world be .
There is something special in its beauty .
Such beauty does not absorb in this small country .
From this tour of the market going back to its cruise , when suddenly came out in the water of the sea along with the road then it was felt as if the people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of leopard fishes floating in depths of several metres were seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely settled from the city .
If you can see a few centimetres clean in sea or river water contagious with any city of India then you will be able to get yourself fortunate .
The evening spent in Malaysia while returning to M . . . was roaming in meditation for two hours .
Coral rif -LRB- peanuts -RRB- is the life here .
You will also find peanuts on the stones attached to the tombs .
We were standing outside their government residence some time before listening to the voice of President Nashad .
We were not sure that there was no security worker far beyond the accommodation of the best interests of any country .
With pleasure we were pulling gardens and fountains fifty metres away by increasing our hands inside the gates of its garden .
Can you imagine this about the houses of any excellent army of India 
If we know this also then it was said that while crossing the main road sometimes two blocks ahead reach our office .
Everything about Maldives was thrilling .
That is why I was waiting for the next day unexpectedly .
Allama was that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Malldev while crossing the circular path .
In the evening when the cruise was reaching near the Mall then we immediately recognized the slippers passing from above .
So many pictures that he had seen .
But then there was no pride that next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We were about to go to Rangli Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the Saplin of Transplant Devon .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the ocean of Maldives from Siplin flying till a height of approximately one thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a romantic and breathtaking blow .
But on reaching the Conradjunctuary of Hilton Hotel on the Rangli Island it started as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world whose external world there was no dearth of any world .
It was not even like this that it was difficult to get the beauty out there as well .
One can also tour Konark on foot or by a train running from a battery .
The view of water life on both sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was unique .
Right now we could not even preserve ourselves from the natural beauty of the surroundings , we had reached such a place , had an unforgettable place .
On descending down several metres below the stairs in the sea water we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dinner room .
Across all sides we could see strange types of small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving humans .
There the thought of eating sitting on decorative tables would be extremely attractive in itself .
For one person the fare of seeing and lunching it is 47 thousand rupees after coming to this island from Malaysia .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to give fluid to our passport water .
But we knew that it was not possible .
With a heavy heart it has to be returned with such hope that at some time or the other it will surely be brought here .
Many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to busyness of work this was not possible .
Wildlife was fond of childhood then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bicycle tour after the bike of Khurdungla Pass in Laddakh till Ranggong lake .
On the morning of 27th December we went for a jammer bid from Dilli , but the passion which we had come forth with miracles , we communicated our speed .
The journey from Hapad to Gajraula was really tired .
Crossed roads in front of Upper .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Near our reservoir park was in Dhakali , whose booking we had already done .
This day there was no special program , despite being cold we went for roaming on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett museum which was near Dhangdi Gate , 2 kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went to roam around Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening while returning .
Watching the mirror he told me that if we see the lions roaming in the jungle then we would watch the lions in the dream of the whole night .
In the midst of the depths of the night I suddenly heard a great curse and after that the dogs who began to bowl did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first advice came for roaming black pepper and carbonate fail .
Kaladangi is 30 kilometres away while carbet falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladangi , where some important items related to their life are kept .
While returning we went back 12 . miles .
Kaladangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching Resort Safari Jupsi was waiting for us .
It was told that he has made an arrangement of skiing in the number one September market there .
On asking about number one it was told that Greeceland is more there and tigers come towards it to escape from cold .
On reaching Bajrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We got down for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we stabbed two tusks to the elephant , whose long teeth were .
I collected photography .
This beach guide started trekking for tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , out of which the leopard has died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but there was no excitement in the appearance of the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a tiger attack .
Then Mughals remembered one of their old friends Haldwani .
I put him on such a phone .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He did not see Tiger .
These words were kissed like a sword .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a ticket in the park .
Somebody gave us the advice for the safari inside.
