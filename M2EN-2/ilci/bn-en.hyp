Their language seems to be different from Gujarati .
Yeah, different.
Sindh on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
This language is called Kuchi .
However there is no writing in this language .
If you want to write the text then you will have to write it in Gujarati script .
Near the ground itself is that Anjar city where many times the earthquake took place and the entire city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Tural is near Anjar itself .
The story of Jaisalmer is very exciting .
If we want to return by that route then we will have to take another one month 's holiday and there in Bombay school will be opened .
Then what can be done  Now we will take a train trip by taking fast buses of Gujarat .
Small trains of metre gauge reach Rajkot from the ground .
From there another train of meter gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmedabad a big train will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going on getting worse nowadays .
Due to the increased danger of depression and increase in South Asia tourism has had a profound impact .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan tourism has been seen very less counting in the major states of the country .
According to the recently issued number of tourists from Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 was 10 percent less than the year 2008 .
According to the number 9 . 87 percent of the national tourists and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent less .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 natives and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were there , in comparison to that in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 natives and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
The director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to the incidents of business recession and terror tourism has been impressed very badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop and develop strong basic structures in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India is 3 . 29 percent less in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has become very good .
For the first time since 2000 the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
Nothing has happened from the point of view of tourism .
For desert , palace , fort , pond , forest tourists everything has been kept in the old condition .
For working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the area of tourism all the governments are comprehensive but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get less convenience .
Incidents of rape and irritation happening in Rajasthan along with foreign tourists in the last few years have also spoiled the pictures of this state internationally .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry to the state several years back but it was limited to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the base of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1964 .
This nigam provides facilities like accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units in this nigger .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one single and two trains Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has worsened for some years .
In 2008 - 09 RTDC lost 185 lakh rupees which was estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel condition of this Nigam is such that in the last five years even forty percent houses of this hotel did not get filled .
Along with hotels other units of Nigam have also faced big losses .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this railway .
Even after decreasing the fare it could not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair is less visible .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair in the tourist village of RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year the number there has decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the satisfaction of RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Railways .
There is unforgettable profit due to this rail route .
In the past year RTDC has achieved a profit of about nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
It is natural to get anxious due to this loss in the tourism sector of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest festival of Rajasthan economy .
If the person has the desire to do something then he can make gold from the ground .
Subrata Roy has proved it by making modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahadri mountain range of Maharashtra .

At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of tourists .

Here rice is cultivated .
This place is called the store of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their labour and farming .
Its necessity gets mixed with the Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
In the midst of the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side the sight also falls towards the mild slopes arising in the sky .
Wind is very cold .
In winters along with cold you also feel moisture .
On hearing the sound of curious curtain beneath the trees one gets to see the sand lying on the floor of the wood .
Nothing is seen in the weather due to dullness before sunrise and mist .
Eyes get stuck on the eastern rocks .
One feels like sitting on the bench kept in the verandah .
On applying the hand light sound of the shining saliva of the saliva glows and hands go away on feeling cold in the hands .
Thousands of miles away from our country in the middle of this mountain covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village .
This is my third migration to Swiss.
Before this more time has been spent in Geneva or around it .
Located on both sides of the valley of the Saru river the dense population is spread on a slopy slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Ron on both the sides of which is situated several small and big cities .
Along with the Ron river the road and the roads are clearly visible .
A distance of 300 k . . and a journey of one and half an hour , the parallel of Geneva lake and half of the Ron river coming from east side , near the city named Mondro , Geneva lake which is called French Lake Lake , meets with it .
Geneva city is 100 kms long and 10 kms wide in the western corner of this lake .
The lake here again moves towards the west through the river .
The mountain ranges of Dhauli and Lake Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we reached the mountainous roads of the north leaving the highway on the left side by exit .
Due to the slope of the mountains being southern the sun at noon gives full sunshine all over the place .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is not less than that of us .
The height at which the density of snow increases as it goes .
Despite good snow being frozen on both the sides of the road there is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and bright sun .
After completing a journey of about 20 kms on this rotating hilly road in half an hour we reached a small village named Thal .
Shelley - This is a big multi-purpose bunch made of wood with slopy roof .
In the basement made of this three storied cement concrete along with the arrangement of keeping cars there is also room for controlling essential services like cartilage , water , land etc .
Switzerland is famous for the cultivation of grapes .
This is the main center of making wine grapes .
37  of the total cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
The garden of grapes located on both the sides of the Ron Valley provides a unique aspect of its beauty .
Taking in the gardens of grapes , roaming around , taking rest in the night in the village there and making a grapes of grapes wine chakra is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named earlier there is a big museum of grapes built in a 12th century in Pallivaban , to see which foreign tourists keep making an advance booking .
Once again we were going through the dense forest of Davan .
The mind of the children was getting worse by the question of the road till three to four kms .
Then only a turn comes the dramatic and charming change of the scene .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road many houses are there .
People are skiing on the slopes above the village .
The dense forest of cedar trees spread till the head of the mountain on the skiing slope .
Dense snow is falling all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining with the sun rays .
We reached the village in five minutes .
This silence is spread here as well .
White snow empire ranging from the peaks of the mountains to the valleys all around .
In the next five minutes we reached a big circular chakra in the middle of that tower .
The name of Kaswara is Liukrabad .
The population of Leukarabad settled at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
1700 apartments and shawls with the capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for accommodation of 1500 , camping site for tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants we can estimate the number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here .

Reaching the village one feels a hot feeling .
The thick layer of snow is shining on the roofs of the house in the shining sun .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the preserved places of the national importance in Switzerland .
It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim taxi , so there is no checking .
The journey is on , the state is on the other side , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are also one , the air is also the same .
The moisture in the whole body is also one .
The brightness in the weather during the rainy season is also one .
With the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey the decision to take a joke of carriage was taken for the first time .
Carsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens is completed in the jungles of Dhupi .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
Moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the first tea garden welcomes you in the form of laughter .
The heart gets overwhelmed just by going through the middle of the tea garden through the road for the first time .
On one side is the green mountain filled with jungles and on the other side deep green valleys .
At times the jungles here are seen gardens of tea .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once upon a time it was difficult to see these natural jungles and trees of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens .
It feels strange when there is an eye on the road .
Like the snake rice , the tracks and the changing paths were passing .
Time was also going on .
Those which were not cut , that is forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance several hilly houses and houses etc . were visible densely .
It was Carciang .
Standing at one place here we make the program of roaming all day .
So we set out to roam around Carsiang with a car .
First of all Dear Park .
A small garden is surrounded by thick forests all around .
Ahead to reach till Deer Park one has to leave a car very low .
Despite being full of natural beauty Karsong has not yet been developed or famous as a tourist spot .
Although the city is very clean .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of walking amidst the greed and smokey trees to reach Deer Park surrounded by jungles was thrilling us .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
On the other side of this city there is a point situated at a height .
This is called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a hustle-bustle here on the top of which a beautiful view of the whole city can be seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women are efficient in bringing a token on the back with very fast handkerchief .
There is a museum outside the Carissiang city , but that day we could not go there , because the climate of tea gardens was very important .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but it was thinking bigger than this that if it had rained then how would we roam .
But the connection was very good that on reaching till Rock Garden we could make use of sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
If you go a little below from here then you will find Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the view of waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of rocks are spectacular here and the magnificent world of waterfalls falling on the rocks of Gangamaya .
Both of these places are located quite below the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing upwards with the help of a car we saw an air loop in Darjeeling .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling is seen by binoculars .
The fun of the weather was good till now .
But the one whom we proceeded towards the monastery knows from where the clouds rose and began to shine .
Walking and shopping in Malroad in the evening are planned .
During the journey of Darjeeling the journey of Toy Train makes it even more attractive .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Sleep and Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake and a little breakfast in the garden here .
On this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where sweeter made by Nepali artisans etc . are available .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , rather there is a sound of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolehgaon , which are full of jungle waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for roaming Darjeeling in the winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me on their own .
A journey of my recent times was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of Rajasthan very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes the journey attracts us and sometimes another special place , ship of water or some royal train or some pink city or the lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where I am going to tell that it was made about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place was really made that it was worth enjoying in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears even today my guide Ram Babu felt that before this we could not even imagine that I could stay in such a way in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff are in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did n't get work in heritage hotels .
The residents of Ajbagh used to work in Jaipur before Ram Babu and now this royal garden is in such a way .
He has renewed his fun and frolic in a different style .
The estimation of such a garden of Sahiba .
Nobody addresses you in English there .
Such bugyals are really a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is to introduce it to the places nearby .
How many Bhutanese travellers spend their holidays in the royal way of Rajasthan who do not have to go far away from Vangarh , even very few people in the residents of Jaipur may have spent the night in this area .
After opening such gardens many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana had invited me there but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had reached Bhangarh by mistake of his own way .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , as if those who want to spend less time in a good holiday they should go to such a bag .
This garden is among those seven gardens where the king of Albert took rest to hunt .
It was constructed in nineteen or twenty years .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of such a garden in the shadow of mountains surrounded and dense trees will hypnotise you .
The way you enter inside , the way you will be welcomed , you will feel that here attention is paid to divine peace .
Manglachar ' s mantra is pronounced with mask bandages in hand .
We had reached in the afternoon and we decided to put a circular fashion in the bag .
My table sister Jackie woke up with a shame , this is very charming .
Inspired by all the havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is the glimpse of this place .
It is not surprising that such a bag has been rewarded in recent times .
The administrator fixed our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu on foot and then roamed around in the jeep of Bhangarh .
While walking on the crater we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw Sukhi lake in which farmers are growing .
This year it rained but for the first time it was seen to be the cultivation of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life for Jackie was very enjoyable .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting enchanted in deep meditation .
It's a million dollar time.
They say goodbye to us by eating jaggery and curd in the traditional way while leaving the bag .
Now we realized why tourists come here to spend so much .
I have heard that tour packages are prepared to watch the lives of the tribals .
That's right.
Certainly this is done in not only one state but also in many states and tourists give special encouragement in this tour .
These tours are usually made for four days to two weeks and at this time tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included in it .
This way an attempt has been made to travel such a place where there is not much development and there is no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this old tourist sites etc are also there .
Apart from this concentration is also given on eating fresh food .
Actually the aim of this kind of tourism is to make the tourists confront the tradition of living and eating all these places .
Although it feels a bit difficult to imagine but such tours are really thrilling and a different experience .
There is a different kind of fun to travel by bus .
You can take the pleasure of staying alone despite being with many of them .
Not only this , in this journey you can take a long time to read your favorite book without interruption .
Yes , it is true that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace this journey claims to you all .
For enjoying this journey it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , elderly people of military age , children etc . get rid of this journey and there is arrangement of leaves for both of them .
However , if you buy a ticket from before then it will be a bit cheaper hence in the end the bus journey is better than planning .
Instead of taking tickets on both sides take information about round trips .
It's cheap.
Material regulations are done specially hence you should inquire about the weight of the luggage .
It is not like this that you have to leave your things at the terminal or you have to pay extra rent .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags are appropriate for this journey .
Because it gets stuck on the top of the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods is yours .
From where you board the bus you reach there an hour before the scheduled time .
In the busy season you should keep this in mind specially .
Actually , the sooner you reach the better place to sit .
Remember the comfort while sitting on the seat .
Burps are more in the back side and can not fall properly towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards the corner and if you do not like to be very tired then it will be better if you take a seat towards the window .
Now it's a trick.
If you both are trying to walk then first sit on the seat of the corner and then keep your bag on the seat nearby .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind that while going to the place of sitting it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Talk to the bus driver or conductor .
By this you will be able to know many important information .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time you will not leave your luggage at the place of your own luggage because if it is lost the residents will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back in time .
If you do not have time then you can take a new passenger to your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
It is said that if Rome is not seen in Europe then he has not seen anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for many things .
Rome the capital of Italy is one of the oldest cities of the world from where civilization emerges .
This is the reason that its imprint on western civilization is worth seeing .
Rome , situated beside the Taibaar river , is a pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic followers because the main pope of this religion is Rome .
Ancient Rome is situated on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , cervical wall was built around it .
The ruins of this can be seen around Rome even today .
For ancient buildings and many ruins Rome is famous all over the world .
This city with royal palace , beautiful church , beautiful fountains , gumbaz and magic is hypnotising in its first glimpse .
This large and unique building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy , Divine Victor Emmanuel began to be built in 1885 and ended in 1911 .
In front of it there is a idol sitting on the horse of Emperor Immanuel which takes 20 years to build .
Here unforgettable soldiers sacrificed in the First World War are buried .
The carvings of this memorial and the victory marks built on it are worth seeing .
This is also a museum .
If you are interested in artwork then you must see it .
Along with the memorial not only Rome but also the famous and magnificent turn of the whole of Italy is ' Piazza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this turn is famous as Delhi 's Vijay Chowk .
Besides this Piata de Spagnao is also very popular for tourists and people come to visit each other in the evening .
After enjoying P . . Venezia you must go to the famous road of Rome i . . Via del course .
The big shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the beauty of this road .
This road is the main road of Rome .
This unique building is built on the Capitoline Hill and is located at a very high altitude .
Famous for climbing this , Michael Angelo of the stairs was built in 1536 .
Sitting on a horse in front of Capitoline is the idol of Emperor Marx Arley who ruled Rome from 160 - 180 AD .
This beautiful idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capitoline is also a different identity of this building .
There is a church , magician and ancient temple in Capitoline Complex .
The replica of Rome is Calcium .
The construction of this large umbrella was done in 80 AD and 50 thousand audiences could sit here simultaneously .
Gladiators i . . swordsmen show their duties in Colosseum .
This would not have happened in itself , would have fought with the wild animals .
Whether it is with other swordsmen or with animals , this fight awakens in the mind , till the time one dies .
In ancient Rome there were many forums .
We did n't tell that the place to visit is called forum .
All the social , religious , economic , political etc activities of the city take place here .
Among these the most famous forum was Roman and the remains of Rajbhavan , temple and pillar are present even today .
Seeing these the estimation of the importance of ancient Rome can be done very well .
Panthiyan - This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 AD .
There is an open space of 30 feet in the middle of its huge dome .
For this place devotees feel that their prayers are reaching straight to the God .
Inside the temple statues of gods and goddesses are made all around .
Although in 616 AD this temple was converted into a church .
There are many gardens in Rome but Villa Borgis is incomparable .
Therefore do not forget to see it in Rome .
You must also go to the museum here because if you do not see this then you will lose the chance to see beautiful carvings .
The idol made here is unique and so delicate that it feels like speaking at once .
Here the first Napoleon 's sister Polin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis royal family , the idol of sleeping in her palanquin looks so lively that you will not be able to see for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is the fountains here .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which there are beautiful fountains .
The most famous fountain here is trivial fountain .
It is believed that if somebody goes to Rome again then he should take a piece of money in this fountain with some imagination .
By doing this concentration gets over .
The journey of this ancient city is not complete until you see Vatican City .
In the sixth century this place is the residence of the highest religious head Pope of the Roman Catholic followers .
Although it is in Rome only but in 1926 a status of an independent city was given .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter Square , Fountain , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Actually this will show you the sight of a different world and you will always be able to remember .

The fare of cruise is tea - snacks , food all included .
Always with entertainment .
On reaching the capital Malli you can take the pleasure of entertainment , activities according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to the launch of underwater .
If you suddenly get a plane standing in front of you to roam around the big airport then it will be a toy .
But this Tuin Ooty plane with a 12 - 15 sitting place is excellent in the form of a destination for roaming on an island group like Maldives .
One can not even tell when suddenly he gets up in the air to run like a speed boat on the water .
Throughout the flight you will feel like riding on an ordinary plane .
You will always be able to see the reservoir islands and palanquins with different kinds of blue colored water of Maldives .
How clear everything looks .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldivesian is one of them with a 20 c plane .
If you want you can roam around for four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or you can hire the entire plane for a day 's journey -LRB- surely for that there should be a pressure of tax -RRB- .
If you go to another island from Malays Island then it will be necessary to travel by sea plane because there is only one way of traveling between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you never want that you end .
Sea plane is made on the island of Maldives for 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilavaru -RRB- from 12 kilometres to Suru .
We were at the shops of the biggest antique and swine flock of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Mall .
All Salesman Maldives had listened very carefully to the speeches delivered by the President of Maldives at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
In a way I could not see any Hindustani speaking so much of the words of the president or prime minister .
But when there is a question of a new existence being created on this earth then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people will also be able to imagine the meeting done by the cabinet of Maldives in October when Maldives think that if the wrath of nature snatches it from us then how impoverished will the world be .
There is a different kind of thing in its beauty .
This small country does not seem to have so much beauty .
While going towards Jetty to return to that cruise again from that journey of the market when we realized how much people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water is so clear that in the light of lamppost colorful fish can be seen in a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
You will be fortunate to see a few centuries in the water of sea or river connected with any city of India .
The evening spent in Malaysia to come to the top of Ambie Aquamine has taken two hours .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get relished on crampons .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nashi we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest personality house of any country , no security personnel could be seen far and wide .
We were enjoying taking photographs of the garden just 50 metres away by raising our hands inside the gates of its bungalows .
Can you think of any leader 's house in India like this 
It was also known that the President had ever gone to his office two blocks before crossing the road walking on foot .
Everything about Maldives surprises us .
That is why we were waiting for Brussels the next day .
It seemed as if this day would be special .
In the morning we took a boat from the cruise and took our airport to Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the curve of the runway .
The next day in the evening when the cruise was reaching near the Mall , we immediately recognized the plane passing above .
I saw a lot of pictures .
But then did I know that next day I would get a chance to ride on this plane .
We were going to Rangoli island five kilometres away by plane to Trans Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives flying around thousands of metres above this sea plane .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
In excitement and excitement breathing was like a stoppage .
But on reaching at the Conrad Resort of Hilton Hotel on Rangoli Island it feels as if we have come to another world .
In such a world which has no relation with outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and luxury found here was difficult to get out .
Travellers can also walk on foot or in a battery operated car .
From Jetty to the main island that on both sides of the bridge the view of water life was unique .
Till now we could not get along with the nature around , we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
We descended on the sea water several metres below the stairs and reached such a glass house which was under water .
This house was actually a meal house .
On all sides small and big fishes of rocks , coral , snorekelling and scuba diving people were seen continuously above the glass .
The imagination of eating by sitting on a decorated floor there is very thrilling .
The fare of seeing it and underwater lunch on this island from Malaysia to Airplane is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I was not thinking of returning from there .
We were ready to drive our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With the feeling of sadness I returned with this hope that sometimes , sometimes luck will come here .
I was planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but it was not possible for the busyness of work .
Since childhood had a lot of interest in wildlife hence I thought lets go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 before Khardungla pass in Laddakh it was a second bike journey after biking till Penang lake .
On 27 December we got out of Delhi for Jim Corbett but the fragrance with which we got out we had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajraula was very tiring .
Again on them is the path of despair and misery .
Many times it felt that it would have fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres before Ramnagar .
Near our resort park itself was in Tikuli , whose booking we had already done .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we went for a walk on the sides of Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for Corbett museum which was near Ghangadi gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was late to return .
I came out firmly from Delhi that I would definitely see tigers roaming in the jungle but I had seen tigers throughout the night in a dream .
In the depths of the night I could hear a loud sound and then whatever the dog started to chew it kept on running for two hours .
Initially Kaladungi and Corbett came to the advice of visiting the fruits .
Kaladungi is 30 kilometres away , Corbett falls on the way .
In Kaladungi is the exhibition house of Jim Corbett Sahib , where some special things related to his life are kept .
It was half past twelve to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village itself .
After reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they made arrangements for sighting in the number one site Bijrani .
It is said about number one that grass is more there and tigers come this way for protection from cold at this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide that we would take two and a half rupees for roaming around for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two teeth elephants , which had long teeth .
I got a boot on the floor.
In the midst of this the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park , many of whom died in these days .
At many places we got to see the footprints of the tiger , but due to the lack of sightseeing the tiger the heart was restless .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
A ghost of a lion had pressed me in my head .
That is why I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I just called him.
I told him I came to Corbett.
He asked if I had seen a tiger .
His words were tied like shores .
I said slowly that I didn't see.
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
One of our guys told us to take a safari for a walk inside .
