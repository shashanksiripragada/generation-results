There nobody invites you in English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist spot with all the good facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas .
To spend holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people can roam around the bangles , why should they go far , only a few people of Jaipur may have spent the night in this area .
After opening the Aman Garden many people from within and outside reach there .
I remember that night when Sapna Ashmi had called me with interest but I could not go .
When they reached Pangtok after finding their own way then this is a different kind .
This time at the invitation of my foreign guests I realized that these people want to spend a good holiday in a short span of time so that it is necessary to go to Aman Garden .
This garden is a separate garden conserved in those seven gardens where Alvar king had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .

From Aman Garden also Alvida said that it was a tradition which gave us the gift of jaggery and curd .
Tourists are able to know why they are spending so much here .
I was told that a tourist group was formed to see the life of the tribe .
Is it right .
Certainly this is found in some states of unparalleled state and tourism is very interesting in it .
This tourism is generally organised from 4 days to 2 weeks and this time tourists are taken to different places .
How to stay there .
This way an attempt is made to do such explanations where there is not much development and there there is no special arrangement for the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots also .
Besides this it is also taken care of doing tridental cuisine survey .
In reality the lifestyle and genetics of that place is seen directly for tourists who love such tourism .
Though it is a bit difficult to imagine but such tourism gives interest and gives a different experience .
It 's a lot of fun to travel in the bus stand .
You can enjoy roaming alone even if you see crowds here .
Not only this , during this journey you can take too much time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with giving less expense and peace all the time this journey also makes us happy .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you will be able to see foreign destination buses through tourism .
Before taking a ticket look for a best deluxe .
Stupa is the main center of attraction for tourists .
Like this it is better to buy prepaid travel tickets so it is better to make tours on the bus terminus if you want to make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling they should tell about the routine trip .
Expenditure is less in the morning .
It is very important to carry goods , therefore take into account the matter of obesity and weight .
You leave some of your products with tarmac or you fill them with electromagnetic materials .
Also enjoy the pleasure of insurance or loss from the tourist group .
Take calorie on packs with convenience .
Because it can be put on a rock above the seat .
Keep this in mind that during tourism the responsibility of changing things from bus to bus is on your own .
Wherever you have a bus go one hour before that time .
During the busy season you can keep this matter in a special period .
Actually the sooner you go the better seat system is near you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
Take the back portion also more but it is not easy to study in the front portions .
If you are going to urinate again and again then take a distant observation , if you do n't want to be very troubled , then the place near the door is excellent for you .
Now there is a tactical thing .
If you are both sitting in the seat of the seat then first sitting on the seat of the corner keep your pack on the other side .
Therefore if there is not much crowd in the crowd then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore , if there is facility of brushing in the bus then while choosing the seat keep this thing in mind that it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information .
Everybody gets out while cleaning the market .
Do not keep yourself on the pit during this time , because if it is lost then the crowd will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stands go back on time .
But if you do not go on time then you will get to see a new passenger in your place and you will have to expect another bus terminus .

Every time you will see below the window , below the separate settlements of the Maldives in the water , the Rishind Islands and the Coral Islands will be viewed .
Everything has two blankets .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
There is a lot of beauty in Trans Mall island around which there is sea plane .
If you want then you can roam around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in the air for hours or the entire plane will be left out for you throughout the day .
If you are going to the island of Maldives then it is important to travel on sea-blane because it is common to travel between different islands .
And if this is a journey then do not travel in such a way that fear may arise in the mind .
The journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres from sea level is done on the islands of Maldives .
We were in the most Antique and Sovaniyar shops of the capital of Ahmadi Bazar situated in Maldives .
All the salesmen are very carefully listening to the lectures given in the position of world peace in the Kaven Hall a day before by the king of Maldives Mohammad Nath Tagore .
I believe that neither a Hindustani nor a President nor a Prime Minister has ever listened with so much attention .
But when there is a challenge in the situation of this earth 's unparalleled structure then such fear is important .
Some people know very well the magicians going inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives in October because the wrath of Maldives is so impossible that the world becomes so impoverished by taking them away from us .
In the beauty there some special kind of beauty is there .
There is no such beautiful tomb in that small country .
After roaming around in the market you can return back to your cave and then while paying a glimpse of the road a meal of sea - water is felt because the people here know this beautiful surprising boundary .
Below the bright light of Lamp Pongt the fishes swimming in a few metres deep enhance their beauty .
This was a part of the sea which was attached to the city once .
If you are able to see some centimetres clearly in the river or sea water connected with any city of India then you can enjoy yourself .
On returning to M . . Akvamir we kept on roaming in Jagannath for two hours in the evening of Maldives .
Coral reef -LRB- coral reef -RRB- is the life here .
Till now you will find rocks and fountains on the pits of fountains .
In order to listen to the words of President Nasik we were standing outside after some time in government caves .
We were at the forefront of the best ruler of a country , there was no security till far , because we could not believe it .
In the joyous way we were taking potatoes in the garden and path around 50 metres away after extending our hands inside the terrible gate .
Can you think this by taking you to the house of some ordinary head in India 
It is said that the president had always come to his office two blocks before crossing the roads .
In the matter of Maldives every thing is worth defeating .
That is why I had the expectation of restlessness the next day .
It should have been good lunch that day .
In the morning a boat from Guruji reached us till Air Force Jalandhar .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around in Ranway .
Later in the evening when Guruji came out from Maldives then we immediately recognized the crew moving above .
We were watching all his maps .
But then there was no doubt because the next day there was a chance of paying attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali island a 500 kilometres away from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
Khanphu was unforgettable with the hundreds of rice and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives , flying up to a height of about 1000 metres .
This beautiful water is not found anywhere .
This is a journey of thrilling and exciting breathing .
But when Hilton Hodels Sin Corbett Resort reached on the island of Rangai it feels as if we have come to some other world .
In such a world , outside there was no relation with any other world .
It was difficult to find beauty or comfortable life out there .
Walking in Konark can be done either by trekking or by boating in battery .
On both the sides of the bridge while going till the main island from Jetti it was amazing .
Now with the natural beauty of our vicinity we could not stay natural . had come to an unimaginable place .
We reached a glass room while climbing down several metres down the stairs in the sea , which was under water .
That half was actually a meal room .
All around through miraculous glasses we could do wonderful types of small fish , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The imagination of sitting on the decorated tables of these places keeps you adventurous .
The fare of seeing this island coming from Male to sea plane and eating under water is 47 thousand rupees per person .
The heart is not able to return from there .
We were ready to float our passport in water .
We know that this is not possible .
We returned with the same belief in mind , sometimes at some point of time luck will definitely bring us back .
For a long time we had planned to go to Delhi from Delhi but due to being busy in work this did not happen .
Because of the wish of the child in the wild animals why this time we thought of not going to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 after trekking in Laddakh from Kardukla Pass and at some distance from Yakong lake it was another pigeon .
In the early morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but no matter what kind of excitement we went for , mood lessened our speed .
The journey between Haboot and Kaziranga was really tired .
Snow from the top and dirty road from the front .
Several times it seemed as if we are falling .
On one side we came to Garjraula at 8 in the morning .
We had come to Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is at a little distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We had already registered our resort in Tiku , near our park .
After getting cold we went for a stroll on the shore of Kosi .
After two - three hours we went to the Corbett Museum which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres bending near the cage .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar a day below .
It took us a long time to return back .
It was clear from Delhi that if I had seen the tigers left in the jungle then I would have seen tiger all night .
During the dark nights suddenly I heard a loud sound , after that the dogs did not stand for two hours starting to shout .
Therefore Kalatuni and Corbett waterfalls come first .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett Island in Kala Tunnel where some objects related to personal life were kept .
The museum of Jim Corbett Island is in Kaladungi .
The work of returning was half an hour .
Kala Tungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village only .
On reaching the hotel Safari Gypsy was looking forward to our arrival .
He told us that a tour has been organised there for the first time in the Saint Bijrani .
When we asked about the number one then the lions used to come here for the protection of the cold .
On reaching Bijarali we got a guide , for four hours we took a hundred and fifty rupees for roaming around .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
Many types of animals and deer have been seen there .
Inside we saw two swimming elephants which had long teeth .
I picked up the film standing up.
In the meanwhile the guide started trekking for Phili .
There are about 150 tigers in the park among which some tigers have died in one year .
At many places we saw their footsteps , but I was sorry that we could not see the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
My brain was filled with the lack of LTTE .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I telephoned him.
I told him I was in Corbett.
He asked me if I had seen the tiger .
His words fell like arrows .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
One said that take a chopper to go inside .
