Near Anchar there is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .

From there a small train of metre gauge reached Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge reached Bombay .
Considering the capital of Rajasthan being considered to be the main foundation of the economy , tourism department passes through bad governance at this time .
In Vaishno Devi and South Asia there is a strong obstacle in the enterprise with increasing dangers .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan with the point of view of connecting major states of the country is especially less during these days .
According to a recent survey done by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is less than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
The number of tourists in the country decreased by 98 . percent and the number of foreign tourists decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came together in Rajasthan , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included , because in 2009 together 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand and 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourist spots think this situation properly .
According to the director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik the incidents like the Vaishali temple have a bad effect on the tourism industry .
As compared to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent as compared to last year .
Maximum number of foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
In the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists in France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The concentration of tourism keeps on improving Rajasthan year after year .
This is the first time after 2002 that there was a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , large buildings , forts , wells , forests all are old , to surprise the travellers .
For the purpose of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the area of tourism all the governments get down and down but do not do anything in this direction .
The facility of travellers coming to Rajasthan is available very less .
At the same time along with foreign ladies and tourists in Rajasthan in recent times incidents of rape and provocation the image of this country has been depicted internationally .
The tourism department of the country got disturbed years before the Rajasthan government , but it remained in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of developing tourism and developing the basic structure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
Facilities of lodging , food , pocketing , boating etc . are available for this corporation .
The houses of this corporation are 75 loneliness .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , 8 cafteria , three pathways , one pocket and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the condition of this office has been destructing for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC is estimated to be 185 lakh and in the next year in 2009 - 10 to 63 lakh .
The condition of hotels of this hotel office is this that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels are not filled in 40 square kilometres .
Along with hotels other loneliness of tourism is also a big loss for this .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Passengers do not get attracted towards this train .
Due to less rent this does not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of the travellers towards the Pushkar Fair also starts decreasing .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair there were 398 foreign tourists staying in the tourist area built by the RTDC and this year its number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the pleasant thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of tourists in the attraction of Palace on Wheels and Shahi train .
This train benefits continuously .
Last year from this train RTDC got a profit of nine crore rupees .
It is natural to see the waves of doubt in the tourist spots coming to the tourist spots of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .

After passing through the middle of the tea gardens the heart gets overwhelmed for the first time , this is one of the places conserved in the form of Sampath .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a deep green pit .
If there is forest in the middle then tea gardens can be seen in between .
The kingdom of greenery is all around .
Once upon a time I am in a dilemma , whether these natural jungles are visible or the tea planted by humans .
Both draw towards themselves .
The more beautiful is the jungle the tea garden spread in an expansive expanse .
When eyes fall on the roads on the roads then the creation marvels .
The serpentine shape crossed a narrow and circular path .
Time is also passing .
Forests and tea gardens do not end .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
From far off places on a mountain one can get to see a lot of beauty from houses and buildings .
It's Carciang.
Staying at one place here we prepared a program to roam around the day .
That is , taking a vehicle we left for Carsiang .
First of all, Dear Park.
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
Climbing up and down to the deer park the vehicle is very low .
With regard to being filled with the beauty of Carcianic beauty it has not yet been developed in the form of a tourist spot .
Because the city is as clean and as clean .
In the wake of the breakfast the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the path between the trees in the sun gives us the courage .
The next place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called suicidal point ' .

There is a museum outside the Cariang city but that day we did not go there because it was necessary to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
Next day we decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience for me , but if it was raining then there was a lot of thinking about how we would walk .
But the coincidence was very good that when we reached Rock Garden we enjoyed the pleasure of the sun rising .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
When we descended a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here in the middle of the rocks a queue of waterfalls can be seen .
In Rock Garden when we were floating in the kingdom of rocks and rocks then we could see a marvellous museum of waterfalls spread in Ganga - Gaya .

If we came to Darjeeling from Calcutta then for roaming Darjeeling in the shadow of winters only tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling had connected me to itself .
In my situation a small journey is very interesting and thrilling .
This journey is not from abroad but from outside Rajasthan because it is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me , in which some travel is attracted , but sometimes some special place is the water ship or some royal train or some other flight like Gulabi city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are attracted .
The place where you went to do , that was prepared about four and a half years ago , but along with that preparation this place came here and she really enchanted .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears the voice of my guide Ram Babumirna started shouting , the master we had never thought before how we lived in the jungle .
50 percent workers are also of this land area .
Suddenly I felt that people of such a place do not have to work in the heritage hotel .
The inhabitants of Ajabagarh Ram Babu had earlier worked in Jaipur , now it is in this unique Amber blooming garden .
He tells himself that he has changed into a new color.
Master ' is an impression of Aman Garden .
There no one will call you English dominion .
Aman Garden is actually a place of peace and comfort for all .
This garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that it introduces itself through the nearby landscapes .
How many people traveled to Dunnag of the messengers spending holidays in Ambara village of Rajasthan , why should they go far , some people from Jaipur residents sometimes spend the night in this area .
After the opening of the Amal park large people of the country and abroad reach there .
Shabana Azmi called me there very lovingly but I didn't go that night.
Its work is different that on its own , it reached Dangarh by traversing .
This time I arrived at the invitation of our foreign guests this time but those people felt as if they had spent some time on a magnificent holiday , where they must go to the Aman park .
This garden is a lonely garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alawar settled for hunting .
Its construction took place in ten and twenty years .
Its ancient walls are witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains it is witness to strong trees .
The way you come in , that kind of welcomes you , from that it feels that you have taken care of the uneven peace here .
Together with cramps in Manikarn the magnificence of magnificence should be maintained actively .
We reached Ladakh in the evening and made a plan to roam around in this garden .
My guest Jackie is enjoying a mesmerising and thrilling voice .
Everything is inspired by big buildings and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything new and artistic is no wonder that the Amal park has been renovated in the present times .

While walking on the way to Sankari we saw the fort of Ajabagh in which the rays of the sun gradually spread .
On seeing the dry lake farmers make farming in it .
This year it was not rainy season but for the first time we had seen tobacco farming .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackie is a unique experience .
After that we reached Danag in Jeep .
In the morning I kept watching a tourist of Holland with great care .
This is a very valuable moment for millions of dollars .
The way to sail in the Aman Garden is simple and traditional , he told us to leave after giving sugar and curd .
Now we realized why tourists come here spending so much money .
I have heard that there are picnics to see the life of the tribals .
Is this true
Not only this , but many countries are also there in Bastar and tourists are specially interested in it .
This tour is usually made from four days to two weeks apart from this travellers are included in other places .
Wherever one stops one gets food and stuff .
Try to explore such places where there is not much development and there is no effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots and places there .
Besides this one also pays attention to the distribution of traditional cuisines .
Actually the meaning of such tourism is to make the tourists aware of the ways and ways of living in that area .
But if you think it is a bit difficult but such a tourist spot is a different kind of experience .
We enjoyed going on a bus .
Because of being with many people in it you can enjoy touring on your own .
Not only this , on this journey if you take a book of your choice then you will get more time when you get disturbed .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less and full comfortable moments this tourism definitely asks you comfortably .
For enjoying this keep in mind some things especially if you are watching any foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking a ticket check whether it is a good deal .
Students , elders of the army , children etc . get benefit from it but also get relief from other people .
Otherwise , there is arrangement for ticketing in advance , therefore at the last minute it is very good to plan tours on bus but plan is to be done beforehand .
Otherwise , there is arrangement for ticketing in advance , therefore at the last minute it is very good to plan tours on bus but plan is to be done beforehand .
This is cheap .
The regular use of baggage is very hard , that is why one should tell about the size and weight of things .
Sometimes it is not like this that you have to leave some of your things in the terminal or you have to pay more money later .
Also you should know from the tour company the law of insurance or complete loss .
Carry on bags should be kept sharp and taken out .
Because there is stiffness in the rock on the surface of the place .
Also keep in mind that while doing bus service in the middle of the tour the responsibility of the goods is always there .
From wherever you want to climb the bus you can reach there an hour before .
At the time of smelling you should take special care of this point .
Actually the sooner you reach the better place to choose will be with you .
Keep in mind if there is a cuffer while choosing a place .
There is more swelling in the back side , but it is not caffewable to read sitting on the front side .
But if you want to frequently take the place around the sides but do not like to bother you , then the place near the edge is very good for you .
So one thing of intelligence skills .
But if you both are thinking of getting hold of then first sit on the left side and keep a bag on the right side .
But if you both are thinking of getting hold of then first sit on the left side and keep a bag on the right side .
If the bus is more busy then the plan will be successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information from them .
Everybody wants to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time do not leave your stuff sitting around , because if it is missing people do not take responsibility for it .
Whenever the bus stops come back in time .
If you do not come in time then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

Louis cruise is not only an european institution but also an important name for cruise and hotel business .
But due to some difficulty Louis cruise has stopped its services but the possibility of its resumption from October to October remains .
You can go to the end of Maldives for at least 5850 rupees per person in the least cost of the ship of Louis Cruise .
Meaning for three days the expenditure of one person is less than 18 , 000 rupees .
Not only this , if you are two people then the child below the age of 15 years is in complete form .
What else do you want
The cost of cruise includes tea - breakfast .
And all the time fun.
On reaching the capital Malla you can enjoy the pleasure of the activities and activities available on Maldives according to the size of the pocket - from the journey on the sea plane to the lunch below the water .
You will feel that if a plane comes in front of you suddenly after roaming around on big planes then you will feel that you are a toy .
But the Diwan-e-Khas of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in an adventurous way for roaming in an island group like Maldives .
When it flies in the air like a speed boat on the surface of water , it can not be known .
In every flight you will not feel like an ordinary plane .
Your policies will always be below the window - the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water on the various sides of Maldives .
Everything looks very clear.
There are two plane companies in Maldives .
One of them is Trans Maldives , which has 20C planes .
If you want you can take a flight of approximately Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- for hours or you can hire a plane for the whole day -LRB- if you have enough money -RRB- .
Otherwise if you go to any other island from Maldives then it is the best way to travel through different islands .
This journey will never stop you .
C - flight takes a journey of 12 kms to 183 kms on Maldives .
We were at the most ancient and grand shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
Everybody taking luggage in the shop had tried very carefully the language of Maldives ' President Mohammad Nasheed 's address at the World Climate Conference held in Rapan Gun one day before .
Frankly speaking , I have not seen a Hindustani , even a President or a Prime Minister , listening to the language so carefully .
But it is better to ignore silence because it is a question of the bones of the remaining creation of this earth .
Many people call the congress being held under water by the Maldives cabinet in October , but when going to Maldives it feels as if nature ' s wrath is taking it away from us then how impoverished will the earth be 
There is such a speciality in its beauty .
So much beauty can not be enjoyed in that small country .
To return from that end of the market to your cruise do not turn your backs on the window , but to see how much people understand this beauty while crossing through the roads .
The water is so clean that under the bright light the deep swimming fish can be seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
If you want to see a few kilometres fresh water in the sea or river related to any city of India then it will be beneficial .
The evening spent 2 hours after returning to M . . Akva Marine was not clear .
The corals are alive here .
Here you will find cauliflower from the tombs to the rocks .
Just a while before listening to the language of President Nasheed we were outside his office .
We could not believe that we were in front of the house of the best person of a country .
With immense interest we took pictures of gardens and adjoining 50 metres square by climbing through the door of his bungalow .
You can imagine this before any leader 's house in India .
It has been understood that the President sometimes goes to his office two blocks beyond the road by walking on foot .
Everything related to Maldives was moving towards one side .
Therefore I was waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning cruise took us to the airport .
From there we reached a place called Maldives by roaming through the railways .
Last evening while reaching the cruise mall , the plane that went upwards turned off quickly .
Several pictures of it have been seen .
But we did n't know that the next time we were able to travel in it .
We should have gone to Rangoli island 105 kilometres away by trauma mall television .
It is an unforgettable sight to see hundreds of resorts and islands spread in the ocean of Maldives via the C-Airplane flying at a height of about 100 metres .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
It used to be a journey of breathing in excitement and excitement .
But when we got up at the Rangoli resort of the Hilton Hotel of Rangoli Island it felt as if we had reached a different world .
There's another world that doesn't belong to the outside world.
Such beauty , joy and anxiety was also there that would be found somewhere outside .
Travelling in Karnad can be done on foot and a car running in a battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going towards the main island from Jetty was marvellous .
Now we came to our place near by nature to endure ourselves , which was far beyond thinking .
With the help of stairs we descended a few metres below the sea and reached a mirror beneath the water .
That room was actually a cottage .
On all sides mankind also saw small and big fishes , corals , snorekelling , scuba diving etc .
The thrill of thinking of eating and drinking while sitting on the decorated tables there is sparkling in us .
The expense of a person reaching this island from Malla and taking lunch under water is 47,000 rupees .
There was no intention of coming back from there .
We were ready to wash our passport in water .
But I knew it wasn't possible.
If there is a destiny with a heavy heart , something can come here again .
A few days back a plan was made to go out of Delhi but due to busyness this could not be done .
Since childhood wildlife was an excitement , why did not this time go to Jim Corbett 
In 2006 this was the second bike tour of Laddakh after a bike till Pegong lake in front of Cardumgal Pass .
In the morning of 27 December we left for the purpose of Jim Corbett from Delhi , but from what Joshkhat had left , the snow of crawling snow blocked our journey .
The journey between Happud and Gajoda was comfortable .
The snow covered from the top and the rod cut in front.
I felt it would have fallen several times .
In a way we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near Park and we had booked it earlier .
There was nothing special about this but despite being cold we went on walking on the bank of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
When she came back Ratri was very late .
While coming from Delhi it was decided that the lion roaming around in the jungle was definitely a lion all around me in dreams .
In the middle of the depth of the night I suddenly heard a deep roar , after that till 2 pm the dogs rolled without stopping .
The first opinion was that Kalbhangi or Corbett lake should be visited .
Kalbhangi is 30 kilometres away , but Corbett is on the way to waterfalls .
In the museum of Corbett Sahib in Kalabhumgi many things related to his life have been preserved .
Twelve.30 hours tonight when you come back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett started to reach this village .
When we reached the resort Safari Gypsy was screaming at us .
He used to arrange sighting facilities in the top bidders there .
Asked about the first number , it was said that because of the excess of grasslands the grass had come here to protect from the cold .
We were given a guide when we came to Bijrani.
We prepared for the jungle inside .
We prepared for the jungle inside .
Inside, we saw two tusker elephants, their horns were very large.
I took a lot of pictures.
Launched the guidance of the tiger.
The guide said that there are only 150 tigers in the park , some of them died late .
At many places we saw the marks of their nails but we were distressed because we could not see them .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my thought the entire tiger was riding .
Then I remembered an old friend of mine in Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I was in Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see a tiger or not .
These words of his fell on the ground like a filth .
I said softly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike in the park .
Someone advised me to take a ride inside.
