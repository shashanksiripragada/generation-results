Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
It is called ' kutki ' .
Incidentally it is ' Boli ' , it is not its own script .
If you have to write cotton then it is written in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquake has come and the entire city has been devastated .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the path from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's holiday and then we will have to open schools in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now telling the fast buses of Gujarat we will travel in the train .
A small train of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train towards meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan has been going on since these days due to bad times .
Due to commercial recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia tourism has reached a deep impression .
From the point of view of tourism there has been a decrease in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country in these days .
Statistics released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than 10 percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of domestic tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 country and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 country and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are particularly concerned about this situation .
Rajputana gradually speaks to the director of Makars Sanjay Kaushik that positive recession and terrorist incidents have affected tourism business in a bad way .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong base of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also a decline of 3 . 29 percent has come in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan French tourists are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism the recent years have passed better for Rajasthan .
After the year 2008 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forest everything is that old for the tourists to enjoy .
In the area of tourism the matter of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism does increase by all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time foreign palaces along with tourists incidents of abduction and molestation in recent years in Rajasthan have also documented the image of this state at an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of exciting in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing tourism based infrastructure the Rajasthan government had established Artistic in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motor , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train palaces on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the deficiency of RTDC was 185 lakh , whose year 2009 - 10 is estimated to be 632 lakh .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that even in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it extremely deficient .
Main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not become attractive towards this train .
Despite reducing the fares this could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village made by the RTDC this number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for artificiality is this that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Rail ride .
This rail is continuously making use of it .
Last year from this train RTDC got a profit of nine and a half crore rupees .
With this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the heart of man then he can produce gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled it by settling the modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadir of Maharashtra .
The sweetness that he had seen shows happiness in his eyes while progressing day by day .
His happiness was also visible during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread in more than 10 , 000 acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available only on 9  land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
In order to build their houses in this city made for crores of women only many industrialists have started coming forward and today around families are residing in this city .
At first industrialists and residents bought their residence here in the form of holiday homes but now they have made it their first home and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
The ruins of Likawali are very important in West Siang district .
Remains of a large temple are found in Khajuraho .
On the stone pillars of this temple the excavation of the idols of lotus and gods - goddesses is enough which is mostly in a fragmented state .

On this spot a decorated idol of Devi Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are famous among the residents here .
The ruins of Devpali are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .

During the reign of the Chetiya kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was believed far and wide .
The tribes here used to worship Goddess .
Human sacrifices used to be held here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some more ruins are found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the middle of the Dibang and Diung rivers .
According to the famous stories here this place is only an old Vidarbha where at one time the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Desert , Mishishi etc tribes here guide the tourists .
These people themselves also have great respect for this Kunda .
The famous Parashuram Kunda is just near Brahminkund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of roaming in Diung - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of brick pond near Roing are still telling their stories .
Lack of bathing , narrow stairs and one more pond being surrounded by concrete walls on all four sides and the remnants of wide roads are still singing their ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from four hours through jeep from Northern Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where excitement keeps on happening .
It takes several days to reach here before the jeep road has been built .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premrose , vollet , wild cranes , strawberries and raspberries hypnotise the tourists .
Apple and potato are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometers .
This beautiful valley is the residence of immigrants .
With their untiring hard work they have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is the reservoir of rice .
This ten miles long gallery is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of farming .
The need of their irrigation is fulfilled with the Kali Nadi .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley four folds .
In the middle of the chains laden with snow of the left hand a slight redness emerging in the sky is felt .
The best cough in the air is cold .
Along with the chilling cold in the environment one also feels the moisture .
With the sound of garbage below the legs one gets to see the layer spread on the floor of the wood .
There is silence in the environment and nothing is visible because of the fog erupted before sunrise .
Tablets remain on redness before vision .
One feels like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the palate slides away with the sound of a slight crest and the hand separates from the jerk with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in geneba or around it .
On both the sides of the slopy Balkhondi river the dense population settled in the valley is spread very high on the slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rohn valley on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
On the contemporary highway of the Ron river and the cars shouting at it have begun to clear .
At a distance of 300 kms and a journey of half an hour from the car the Jeneva lake coming from the east side along the Jeneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the east side is called Jeneva lake which is called Lake Lake in Fretch .
Jeneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake moves towards the west after becoming a river again .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gangtok and Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke on the left side we reach the mountainous path towards the north leaving this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward the Sun of Afghan is giving abundant sunshine to all the walls .
The amount of snow like the valley is less here - approximately not less .
As the heights go towards , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good cough frozen on both sides of the road there is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Shillong with slopes , are completely big and big bunglows made of wood .
In the basement made from the cement concrete tower of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladder etc . along with parking of vehicles .
Valley is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of making wine of wine grapes .
On 37 percent land part of the entire cantonment there is cultivation of grapes .
The gardens of grapes located on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the gardens of grapes , touring them , taking rest in the night in the villages there and enjoying the wine in the grapes of grapes is an inseparable part of tourism business here .
In a small colony named Age there is a huge collection of grocery liquor in a citadel made in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to make an adventurous booking .
Once again we crossed the same jungle having descended from Dawal .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the pricking questions of children all the way up to three - four kms .
Sahasra dramatically and charmingly changes come from a view on one side .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope above the deep valley a beautiful group of houses are settled .
On sloping above the village people are skiing in the snow .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope a dense forest of Makdev is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are sparkling because of the sun 's direct rays .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the silence is covered .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley the kingdom of the slopy snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round chakra from the center of that town .
The name of the colony is Lukrabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Laukarbad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for a stay of 1500 , camping centres of tents , 90 beds and 50 restaurants .

On reaching the village one feels extremely hot .
In open sunshine above the roof of the house a thick layer of snow is sparkling .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the protected places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only be used for Sikkim , therefore there is no checking .
The journey continues , the area may be different , but the mountains are there , the trees are there , the ethereal winds are there .
The moisture of all body is there only .
In the season of rains lukewarm light is there only .
The plan for the journey of Darjeeling is fixed , first of all the decisions were taken for the glimpse of Karsyang .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , complete with the jungles of sunlight .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If you proceed towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the people moving towards itself while roaming Mussoorie .
Laden with a road in the middle of the tea gardens the heart gets overwhelmed for the first time .
On one side is the green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side is Hagiri trench .
Sometimes the jungle here used to be seen gardening of tea .
All around there was the kingdom of greenery .
Once I got upset , see these natural jungles or plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful is the jungle the more beautiful is the tea gardens spread far .
If you look on the road on the way then it feels very unique .
The walking path of the snake was going on .
Time was also passing .
If not , then jungles and tea gardens .
Sometimes a small settlement is seen .
From a distance a hill appeared very dense from houses etc .
This was Karsyang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming all day .
That is why we set out on a tour of Carsiang taking a car .
First deer park .
A small garden surrounded all around by large jungles .
To reach up to Siddha i . . deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being amazed by the beauty of Karsyang one has not yet been able to develop into a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the pleasure of reaching till the deer park surrounded by jungles and enjoying the road in the middle of the smoke trees was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suside point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by blinking .
At present it is a park and resort .
There is a straight dome here at a height of which on observing the whole city a beautiful scene is presented .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea gardens running with extreme speed on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsiang city , but that day we could not go there , because touring the unforgettable environment of tea gardens became more necessary .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was an adventurous experience in itself , maternal adventure was very worried about how would we roam if it continued to do the same thing .
The coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we enjoyed the sunrise against us .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more interesting than this .
On walking a little below from here we found a Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The view of waterfalls amidst rocks here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are present here in the empire of rocks , then the magnificence of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is worldwide covered with stones .
Both of these places are present very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw the loop loop loop in Darjeeling after getting up with the help of a car .
The entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather had spread till now .
But as soon as we moved towards monastery , where did we decrease and start shining .
Plans for strolling and shopping are made in the evening on Malrod .
In the tour of Darjeeling tower train passes through four moons .
The toy train from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and hustle-bustle in the garden here .
From this route travellers also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepali artisans are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape - color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but there is a traffic of forest - waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot - Lolegaon , which is surrounded by jungle waterfalls .
But in scarcity of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata .
Recently a small journey of mine was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes it is a special place , a ship of water or some royal train or some city like a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of this a special attraction people come to Dharamshala .
The place where I am going to talk this bus has been prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that has come here this place has really turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide recites the words of Ram Babu Meena in my ears , sir , we could not even imagine before this that we could stay here in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people could not even get work in the heritage hotel .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in this very old Jaipur and now in this unique royal style Amn Bagh .
He has given himself a new color to walk on his own .
Saheb ' is the hallmark of Aman Bagh .
Nobody calls you English language there .
Amn Bagh is actually a tourist spot with amn chains and all the comforts .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it gives you information about the regions nearby .
In the royal style of Rajasthan the number of people spending holidays might have toured Bhangarh of the past , why should you go away , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchhek might have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of the Amn Bagh big people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there with a fondness but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh by traversing his way .
This time suddenly I reached there on the request of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to run to hunt .
Its construction took place in nineteenth century .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Garden in the shade of mountains surrounded and dense trees will hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it takes you to know that the divine peace has been paid attention here .
Along with the binding of pearls in Kali the mantra of Mangalacharan is given a live pronunciation .
We had reached the slope in the evening and decided to set up a cycle that garden .
Whatever charms like my Majhi , Sahasa said , it is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
Their lighting is the most beautiful .
Everything has not been surprised at the new architecture that Amn Bagh has received the award recently .
The manager fixed our program for the morning .
First of all on foot journey with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a skirmish road we saw the fort of Ajbagh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which farmers were cultivating .
This year when there was no rains then for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For this such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from jeep .
In the morning and evening I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar priceless moment .
The way to say the architect of Aman Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they sold us .
Now we understood that why tourists come here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal Life .
Is it right .
Of course this happens not only in many states but tourists also show coughing interest in them .
This tour is generally prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time travellers are taken to different places .
In this stopping there , eating etc are also included .
This way there is an attempt to explore such a place where there has been no excessive development and where there has been no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing tridisional cuisine survey .
Actually , the aim of such tours is to make the tourists reluctant with the methods and traditions of living there .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think but such tours are interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite it being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without getting disturbed .
Yes , it is important that along with giving less expense and a lot of rest these tours definitely keep a demand for surroundings with you .
This is the reason that for making them inject some things it is important to keep in mind , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior citizens of military , children etc get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of discount for both people as well .
However , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moments to do planning a little before .
Instead of going on the ticket know about the Round Treatment .
It becomes cheap .
The rules regarding bagge are very tight , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your belongings on the terminal or you have to fill the extra percentage .
Also know the rules of compensation of insurance or loss with tour companion .
Carry on bags are right , lets go .
Because they come fit in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that during the tour while chewing the bus you will have the information regarding the goods on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before from time to time .
During the Big Season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach the better seat operation will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the conferencing .
If you will feel more jerky on the back seat , then it is not comfortable to read on the front seats .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more distorted then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it is a matter of one goal .
If you are in the back of both the arms , then sit on the seat with the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If there was not much crowd in the bus then planning would be there .
If there is facility of basil in the bus , then keep in mind this thing also while chewing the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the busmen do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come in time , then you can find a new traveller from your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

Situated in the capital of Goa Panchim , Ginger Hotel makes the journey of the western shore excellent .
The Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option to spend a comfortable day enjoying bicycling , river rafting , cool breeze air and world famous Goan food on the roads of Goa .
If seen on today 's day then the cheapest rate for Maldives from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees per person .
After that if you stay in Malaysia then you can also get hotels on a little less rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Seasons prove to be beneficial here only .
In the first week of December the Loui cruise from Cochin began the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Steel is a European company and there is a lot of reputation in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Loui cruise has recently abandoned its services , but since October it is expected to be revived .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the Loui cruise ship M . . Aquamerin .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else should be needed 
In the fare of cruise tea - snacks , food all are included .
Recognition of every time has come together .
Reaching the capital Malaysia you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a single plane stands in front of you roaming around in a big airplane then you will feel like a toy .
But this television of 12 - 15 seats is unique for roaming Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do n't have the experience of flying ordinary aeroplanes .
Your eyes keep looking down all the time , watching seashores and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clear everything looks .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them , with which there are twenty - six planes .
If you want you can tour the air of around thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or the entire sea plane can hire for the frequency of your day -LRB- condition is pocket filled -RRB- .
If you go beyond the Male Island on any island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is a journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you might never feel like finishing .
Sea Plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Ummmun -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenier shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Malaysia .
Everyone was listening carefully to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
If said honestly then no Indian could see the President or Prime Minister 's speech so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a miraculous creation of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people might have understood the meeting done inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it feels as if the wrath of nature will lose it then how much will the world be 
There is something special in its beauty .
Such beauty does not mix in that small country .
Returning from that tour of the market going towards Jetty to its ride , when the sight started to go in the waters of the sea along with the bruises then it felt as if the people here understood the value of this beauty .
The water was so clear that in the light of lamppost the fish jumping in depths of several metres were clearly visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you see a few centimetres clean in the sea or river water connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself dry .
While returning to M . . Aquarine two hours of the evening spent in the mall were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- pearl rocks -RRB- are the life here .
Even on the stones attached to the tombs you will find pearls of rocks .
Some time before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
We could not believe that the housing of the best personality of any country was ahead , there was no security guard till far .
Interestingly we were pulling photographs of gardens and verandahs just 50 metres away by lifting our hands inside the gate of its bungalow .
That you can think of such a leader 's house in India .
It was also known that the President sometimes crossed the road on foot and reached his office two blocks ahead .
Everything was surprising about Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day very carefully .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to the airport resort from Saurashtra .
From there we reached the base of the Trans Maldives while crossing the cycle of the runway .
Last evening when Tsomoriri was reaching near the Mala then we immediately recognized the plane passing from above .
So many pictures that he had seen .
But then it was not known that next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were going to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away .
Watching the hundreds of ridges and coral islands lying in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres was amazing .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling blow to breathe with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching on the Rangali Island after reaching the Cornard Resort of the Hillton Hotel it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no residence in any outside world .
The architecture was not such that it was difficult to get out the beauty or temptation like that .
One can tour Konark on foot as well or by a battery operated vehicle as well .
The view of water life on both sides of the bridge going till the main island from Jetty was unique .
Now we could not even simplify ourselves with the surrounding nature , that we reached such a place , was timeless .
While descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Across the glass all around we could see the unique kind of small fish , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of watching it and lunching underwater on coming to this island in sea plane from Malaysia is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to promise in our passport water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart beat it with the hope that sometimes , sometimes on some bending a pillow must be taken here .
They were planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to arrangement of evening this was not possible .
When wildlife was sleeping since childhood then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour after the biking of Laddakh in 2006 from Khardungla Pass to Pagong Lake .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal with which we had come out , Core curved our thrill .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Corbett National Park was established in an area of 87 square kilometres in the Andaman district .
Many times it seemed that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we first went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there Corbett museum came out which was very difficult two kilometres away near Dhangi Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It became very evening while returning .
I had come out from Delhi concluding that if a lion roaming free in the jungle would surely be able to see the lion then in dreams I kept looking at the lion all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night suddenly I heard a tiredness and after that the dogs who started drenching did not remain silent for two hours .
Therefore came the suggestion of touring the first Kaladangi and Corbett Fall .
Kaladangi is 30 kms away while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
It went back at twelve and a half past twelve .
Kaladongi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching Hrishikesh the safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have made arrangements for skiing in the number one point businessman there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland there and tigers come towards it to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam around for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusked elephants , which had long teeth .
I drove and photographed .
In the meantime the guide started trekking on the tiger .
Guide said that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of whom have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their feet , but I was sad not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a fountain of tiger in my brain .
Only then did I remember one of my old friends of Talzani .
I took him the same phone .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
Whether she saw tiger or not .
His words kissed like a thirteen .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody gave us advice that you should take a ride inside .
During the journey we came to know that due to the presence of the busiest highway near the park often the animals get wounded or die by fighting with the vehicles .
