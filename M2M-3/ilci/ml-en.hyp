Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yeah, that's different.
On one side of Kutch Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
It is called kachchi .
It is called kachchi .
If you want to write kachchi then write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is Anchar city , where earthquake took place several times and the whole city was destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal - Torel is near the Anchar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
The way we came back to that path we need a month 's holiday and the church is opened in Mumbai there .
So what will be done  Now you have to travel by train by telling the buses of Gujarat .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj reached Rajkot .
From there a small train of meter gauge reached Ahmedabad and the big train of broad gauge reached Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
The tourism department considered to be the main source of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad governance at this time .
In the world temple and South Asia there is a strong obstacle in the trade industry with increasing dangers .
From the point of view of tourism the number of travellers coming to Rajasthan from the point of view of connectivity of the major states of the country is less in these days .
The new statistics presented by the Rajasthan government in recent times have said that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan was less than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
While taking connectivity the number of tourists in the country has come down by 98 . percent and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign travellers .
In 2008 in Rajasthan two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came together , out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included , because between 2009 together two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourism are thinking about this situation very well .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Hollyday Makers , says that horrific events like Vaishik Mandir have a bad effect on tourism industry .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strong and basic framework of tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to the number of foreign tourists coming to India there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Most of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attention of tourism is being improved every year towards Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there was a decrease in the number of passengers in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism there is nothing new .
Desert , big palaces , forts , wells , jungles all these are old , for surprising travellers .
In the tourist spot all the governments have come down and down to work in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but do not do anything in this direction .
Facilities of travellers coming to Rajasthan are available very little .
At the same time in Rajasthan along with women tourists the picture of this country has been decorated at the international level in recent times and in provocative events .
Years before the government of Rajasthan the tourism department had cracked in the country but it remained narrow only in the newspapers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of developing the basic framework of tourism and tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
Facilities of stay , food , traffic , boating etc are available for the tourists of this corporation .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three roads , one vehicle unit and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the situation of this office has been deteriorating for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC is 185 lakh and the estimate is that in the next year in 2009 - 10 it will be 63 lakh .
The condition of the hotels of this office is that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels will not be filled with 40 square metres .
Along with the hotels the other units of the city also make it a big loss .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Travellers do not get attracted directly by this train .
Because of being less fare it does not attract tourists .
In such a situation in the days of Pushkar Fair the favour of travellers is also seen to be less .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC , while this year their number decreased to 217 .
In the middle of all this the pleasant thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth in the attraction of the travellers of Palace on Hills and Shahi train .
This train continuously benefits .
Last year RTDC had a profit of Rs . 9 crore from this train .
It is natural to see the waves of doubt in the tourist spot from this destruction that has come to the tourist spot of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest basis of the economic situation of Rajasthan .
If humans feel the desire to do something then they make gold from the soil .
It is really worth seeing in the modern city Ambo Valley situated in the Sahyadri mountain range of Subradrai Maharashtra .

In this city spread over 10 , 000 acres on 9 square metres of land hotels , houses and other facilities are available .
In 91 square metres trees , ponds , lakes , gardens and other facilities are available .
Several candidates come forward to build their houses in this city built for monkeys and today around 800 families live in this city .
Initially , in the form of a holiday house the candidates and rices bought their birds at a cost , but now they have made their first house and there was a hustle-bustle of Mumbai nests for employment from here .
Behind Amba Valley is Koyarigarh fort which provides the beauty of this territory .

From this place a ten-handed statue of Durgaji was found which was successful in establishing the place .
Behind the name of this idol and place there are many sweet stories and old stories in the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani still tell the glorious stories of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In the ancient literature and ancient stories the description of the glory of the goddess Tamreshwari is found .
During the time of Chaitha kings this goddess had been recognized in the north - eastern mountains for long .
The people of the tribe here worship the goddess .
Here human strength is also given , which was later defeated by King Gaurinath Singh .
In the Lohit district of Arunachal some other ruins have been found .

The ruins of bathing gates , stairs and other ponds surrounded by strong fort walls and wide roads are still reminded of their ancient grandeur .
We reached Jiro in four hours by jeep from the high Assam city of Narthalakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lover Subansiri district , which was an area where once the king of Bhishmaka ruled .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet these beautiful mountainous places hypnotise the heart of the guests .
This is such a charming place where there are falls .
Before going through the jeep it had to take several days to reach here .
On reaching here the joy of seeing the views of beautiful Prim Rose , Wavellet , Wild Current , Strawberry and Rasberries of big cedar trees get enchanted .
Apple and potato grow a lot here .
At a height of about 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of people falling down .
With their hard work people who have fallen have made it their heaven .
There is abundance of pulses here .
This place is a store of rice .
Ten miles long this field is a living example of their efforts and ability to cultivate .
The need to wet it is fulfilled by the river of feet .
The pine tree shines like moon in the beauty of this valley .
In the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side the eyes fell on the light arunima coming up in the sky of Chakravala .
The wind is very cold .
Wetness is also known along with the cold climbing down from the environment .
Below the feet we look at the particles of the snow lying at the edge of the wooden sound .
The environment is calm and because of the light before sunrise nothing could be seen more .
Eyes fell towards Arunima of the East .
One feels like sitting on a bunch laid in balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of snow like a thorny layer and the hands get dragged immediately when it feels cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , coming to this small village situated amidst the snow laden mountains of Switzerland this is my third foreign residence in life .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this often they used to eat geneba or nearby .
Located in the valley on both the sides of the flowing river of the leaf , the thick slopes of the thick population are spread very high .
This is situated on both sides of the main river of Switzerland , Ron 's valley , a very small and big city .
Gradually moving cars can be seen through the national highway equivalent to the Ron river .
The distance of 300 kilometres , half an hour journey in the car , is equal to the Geneva lake and half the Ronna river coming along the eastern direction along with the Ronna river Montre near the city named Geneva lake which is also called French -LRB- Lekleman -RRB- .
Genevo city is situated in the western part of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake later became a river and spread ahead towards the western part .
On the right side the side of the lake is white and the mountain ranges of the umbrella Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke on the right side we ignore this highway and reach the Northern mountainous path .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not equal .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not equal .
As soon as it rises above , the fear of snow increases .
On both sides of the road due to the change of very climate , clear sky and shining sun there is no cold in the air .
We reached a small village named Thel after a journey of about 20 kms on this Khumavadar mountain road in half an hour .
The roof slopy with stones and large iron storeys made of wood are there all over .
On the basis of the basement made of the cement concrete of this three storey building along with the parking of the cars there is also a department of controlling the required services like electricity , water and toilet .
Valai Switzerland is famous for the cultivation of grape .
This is the main center of making grapes wine .
37  of the whole of the continent is the cultivation of grape on earth .
In the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of grapes give a miraculous expanse to its beauty .
Go to the area of grapes gardens , travel there , rest at night in the villages there and go to the grapes factories and try wheels , all these are the comprehensive part of the tourism industry here .
There is a huge collection of grapes in a fort built in the 12th century in a small city named Aigil which foreign tourists book beforehand for seeing .
Once again our people crossed the jungle with jungles .
Throughout the way of three - four kilometres the mind gets disturbed with the slopy questions of the children .
Suddenly with a curved view a dramatic and beautiful change is made .
In fact nearby on the left side of the road in the upper region of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses remains .
In the upper plains of the villages people do skiing on snow .
On the top of the skiing slope the dense forest of Deodar is spread till the valleys of the mountains .
On all the four sides there is a lot of slope .
The roofs of the houses become shining because of the direct rays of sun falling .
In five minutes we reached the village .
The same silence is shadowed here .
All around there is a collection of beautiful snow from the peak of the mountain to the valley .
In the next five minutes we reach a big round between that small city .
The name of the small city is Lucker Bad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Luckerabad is about 1500 .

Albenin village is one of the places which have been protected in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
Albenin village, national in Switzerland
It is said in Darjeeling that in Sikkim only taxis of Sikkim go so that there is no check up .
The journey is continuing , the region is another , but the mountain is the same .
The shivering cold of the whole body is the same .
Black color of rainy season is also like this .
When the plan of the journey of Darjeeling is certain then first of all we decided to see the view of Karziang .
Karsing is a small city of Darjeeling .
It is full of tea gardens and full of dense forests .
It is famous for production of excellent tea .
While climbing from Siligudi to Darjeeling in the beginning the tea gardens smile and welcome the people coming there .
On crossing the road between tea gardens for the first time charms the heart and is one of the places protected in the form of wealth .
On one side full of jungles , green mountains on the other side deep green valleys .
If there is a forest in the middle then tea gardens can be seen in the middle .
All around is the empire of greenery .
Once I was surprised to see these natural jungles or tea plants planted by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle the more beautiful the tea gardens are spread .
If the eyes go on the roads on the way then the creation is amazing .
We crossed the circular path of snake shape .
Time is also passing .
Forests and tea gardens are not finished .
Sometimes small ponds are seen .
From a distance on a mountain a lot of sight can be seen from houses , buildings etc .
This is Carziank .
Staying at one place here we prepared a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is , taking a car , go out of Carciang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
One has to climb up , to reach Deer Park the train is very low .
In the wake of being filled with the beauty of Carcinca has not yet developed in the form of a tourist spot .
Because the city is as good and clean .
After the path breaking the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing amidst the trees of sun also gives us adventure .
Nearest place is Igel Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called suicide point .
During the time of the British the jewels used to descend from here .
Hill hall is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase fort here , on the top of which a beautiful view of the whole city can be seen .
In the nearby tea gardens women are busy pouring tea leaf with their hands very quickly after entering the large intestine outside .
There is a museum outside Karziang city but that day we did not go there because it was more necessary to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
Next day we decided to roam around in Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience for me , but if it was raining then we had a lot of thinking about how to roam around .
But the reality was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we enjoyed the fun of the sun .
This garden is a charming place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is more beautiful than this .
When we got down a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the magnificence of waterfalls can be seen .
In the Rock Garden if the waterfalls are shining in the kingdom of stones and rocks then the magnificent world of waterfalls in the Ganges can be seen dividing with stones .
These two places are located very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of a car we saw an incomparable scene in Darjeeling .
From here with the help of Doordarshan all the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen .
The condition of weather remains clear till now .
If we climb to the monastery then we can see the clouds standing .
The evening becomes present and shining from somewhere .
During the journey of Darjeeling Twai train also enjoys the journey .
The journey of train from Darjeeling to Dhum , Dhum to Darjeeling attracts the tourists specially .
Here boating in Mirik lake and some rest in the garden .
Through this path tourists also go to Pashupatinath market , where sweater etc . are made of Nepalese artisans .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling , but its shape and color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is a residence of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot of Lava and Lolegaon which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we came to Darjeeling from Calcutta to roam Darjeeling in the shadow of winters but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling have joined me towards itself .
If my condition is then a small journey is very thrilling and thrilling .
This journey is not foreign but outside Rajasthan because it is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a funny subject for me , in which some tour attracts me , but sometimes some specific place is a ship of water or a Shahi train or a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where we went to do was prepared about four and a half years ago , but with those preparations this place came there and they really rejoice .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who live there .
In my ears the sound of my guide Ram Babumina drowned , the master did not think before this how we stayed in the jungle .
Fifty percent of the workers are of this territory .
Suddenly -LRB- suddenly -RRB- I felt that people of such places would not be able to work in the Heritage Hotel .
Ram Babu , the resident of Ajabgarh , had worked in Jaipur before this , now in this unique Amman garden .
He was telling himself that he changed into a new color .
The lord ' Amman Garden ' is a plate of garden .
There no one will call you in English authority .
Amman Garden is actually a center of comfort and comfort .
This garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that its introduction is through the neighbouring territories .
How many people traveled to Dangarh of the messengers out of those who spend holidays in Ambra Praui of Rajasthan , why to go away , some people from Jaipur residents spend the night in this territory .
After opening the Amal Park big people of the country and abroad reach there .
Shabana Asmi called me there very lovingly but I remember that night I didn't go.
Its heart is different which reaches Dang through itself .
This time I came there at the invitation of the hospitality of our foreign guests , but those people felt as if they had spent a glorious holiday in some time then they should definitely go to Amman Park .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar made a camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in the tenth and twentyth century .
Its old walls are witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains is a witness to strong trees .
As you come inside welcome you in such a way , from which it feels as if you have taken care of the monumental peace here .
Together with binding the church in Manibandhan the mantra of Mangalacharam should be done actively .
We reached La in the evening and planned to roam around in this garden .
My guest Jackie feels like a decorative and artificial .
All are inspired by big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything new and artistic is not surprising that Amal Garden has got the recognition in the present time .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all along with Ram Babu on foot and then the jeep journey of Dang .
While walking through the street of Sankari we saw the fort of Ajbagh , in which the rays of sun gradually spread .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers cultivate .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
Jackik is a unique experience of the beauty of rural life .
After that we reached Dang in the jeep .
In the morning I kept watching a tourist of Holland with great care .
This is an unprecedented moment of Millennium dollar .
The journey of Amman Garden is traditional and traditional , they gave us jaggery and curd .
Now it is known why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that there are also tourism to see the life of the tribals .
Is this right
Beshak is not such a thing , it is in many countries and tourists look specially interesting in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and in the middle of this tourists are included in different places .
Wherever it stops , food and food are included from there .
In this way such places try to explore where there is no development and there is no effect of time in the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are ancient tourist spots here .
Besides this it is also paid attention to the supply of traditional kujins .
Actually the meaning of this kind of tourism is to understand the ways and traditions of living in that area .
Although it has some difficulty in thinking , but such a tourism is a charming and different kind of experience .
Touring on bus is a pleasure for us .
Because of being with many people in this you will get the joy of roaming alone .
Not only this if you take your favorite book in this journey then you will get more time in getting disturbed .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving at least , complete comfortable moments this journey definitely needs tolerance from you .
To enjoy this keep in mind some things especially if you are seen by a foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking the ticket you should find a good deal .
Students , big people of the army , children etc . get benefit from this , but other people also get relief .
Though there is arrangement of ticketing in advance , therefore it is very good to plan tourism by bus at the last moment but plan should be done a little early .
Though there is arrangement of ticketing in advance , therefore it is very good to plan tourism by bus at the last moment but plan should be done a little early .
This is cheaper .
The routine taking the baggage is specially hard , hence tell about the size and weight of the goods .
Sometimes it will not be like this that you will have to leave some of your things in the terminal or you will have to lock more money later .
Together with this you should also know the law of paying insurance or loss to the tour company .
Carry on bags should be kept fine and taken away .
Because rocks come on top of the buttocks .
This thing should also be kept in mind that while bus checking between the tour the commodity of the commodities is responsible for itself .
From where you want to climb by bus you will have to reach there one hour ago .
During smelling intervals you should take special care of this thing .
Actually as soon as you reach , you will have to choose the best place .
While selecting the hips keep in mind whether there is a covert .
In the back buttock there is more skull , but reading sitting on the back heels is not a coffertable .
If you want hot wind several times then take a snap on the sides but if you do not like to be more disturbed then the snap of the edge will be very good for you .
Then one thing of intelligence skill .
If you are thinking of handling both then first sit on the heel of the side and keep the bag on the heels .
If you are thinking of handling both then first sit on the heel of the side and keep the bag on the heels .
If the bus is not busy then the plan will be successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
While cleaning the bus everyone says for going out .
During this time do not leave your luggage in the bed , because if it is lost then the busmen will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops return on time .
If you do not come in time then some new traveller will get your place and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After that if you stay in the mountain then you will get a hotel at a very low rate , but to enjoy the real beauty of the Maldives if you go to any island outside nearby then the pocket will be small .
Sea journey is beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise is the only ship from Kochi to Maldives , Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European institution and is also known for cruise and hotel business .
But due to some difficulties Louis cruise keeps on stopping its services but there is a possibility of resumption from October .
The ship of Louis Cruise at the lowest rate you can go to the end of Maldives at least three days including at least Rs . 5850 per person every night .
That is , the cost of one person for three days is less than 18 , 000 rupees .
Not only this , if you are two then for a child less than 15 years of age there is total simplicity .
What else do you want
The cost of cruise includes tea and breakfast .
Then the whole time is fun .
On reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the fun and activities available in Maldives according to the size of the keys - from sea plane journey to lunch below water .
If a flight comes in front of you suddenly after roaming in big planes then you will feel like a game .
But with 12 - 15 seats , Divenum Oter Airplane is excellent for touring the island group like Maldives .
When it runs like a speed boat on the surface of water , it can not be known when it flys in the air .
In all the flights you will not feel like normal flights .
Always your policies will be below the window - on various sides of the Maldives the resort islands and coral islands in blue water .
Everything looks very clear .
There are two C airlines in Maldives .
Trans is one of these in Maldives , for which there are 20 C flights .
If you want then you can take a flight journey of about 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or you can rent the entire C flight throughout the day -LRB- if you have a pocket full of money -RRB- .

You will never feel like stopping this journey .

We were in the biggest ancient and grand shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
Everybody standing in the shop tried a lot of carefully by the Maldives President Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Convention held in Rapanganj a day ago .
In fact I have not seen any Hindustan listening to the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But it is better to keep silent on being a question of the existence of a residual creation of this earth .
Many people call the summit in the water through the Maldives cabinet in October , but when we go to Maldives then it feels that if the nature is angry with us then how poor the earth will be .
There is such a speciality in the beauty there .
In that small country so much beauty can not be stopped .
To go back to your cruise from the edge of the market it is necessary to turn towards the jetty , to know the beauty of this beauty of the people going to the water of the sea through rods .
The water is so clean that under the light of the calf the deep swimming fish can be viewed with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
You will be able to see some kilometres clean water in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India .
The evening spent two hours after returning to M . . Aqua Marine was not clear .
The pavilions are the life here .
Here you will get tortoise till the stones on the tombs .
To hear the language of President Nashid we stayed outside his office some time ago .
We could not believe that we were in front of the house of a country 's best person .
With great interest we took a picture of the garden and courtyard of 50 metres surrounding Kenniti through the gate of his bungalow .
Can you think like this before any leader 's house in India .
It was understood that sometimes the President travels on foot and goes to his office on the other side by road .
All the things related to the Maldives were moving towards one side .
That is why I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning we reached the airport in Cruise .
From there we reached the place named Trams Maldives roaming through the Railways .
On reaching Cruise Mala last evening we returned quickly .
Many of its pictures were seen .
But I did not know that the next time we could walk on it .
Transmall TV C - We had to go to Rangoli Island at a distance of 105 kms through airplane .
To see hundreds of resorts and pavilion islands spread in the sea of Maldives through airplane flying at a height of approximately 100 metres is a marvellous view .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
With thrill and thrill it was a journey of breathing .
But when we came to Rangoli resort of Hilton Hotels of Rangoli Island then we felt that we had reached another world .
There's another world that has no connection with the outside world.
There was an excitement of this kind of beauty , joy and joy somewhere outside .
The journey of Konark is possible on foot and on a car running in battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jati to main island was amazing .
Now we have come to the place after tolerating ourselves from the outside nature , which was far from thinking .
With the help of stairs we descended a few metres below the sea and reached a glass room below the water .
That room was actually a cottage room .
On all the sides we also saw people doing small and big fish , pavilion , snorkelling , scuba diving .
We enjoy the thrill of eating while sitting on the decorated tables there .
The cost of a person reaching this island by flight from Mala is 47 , 000 rupees for seeing and having lunch under water .
I didn't want to return from there.
We were ready to take out our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
If you have a destiny with a heavy mind then you will come back with the belief that something will come here again .
For a few days a plan was being prepared to go out of Delhi but it was not possible due to busy work .
Since childhood wildlife was a zeal and why did not we go to Jim Corbett this time .
This is the second bike tour after cycling till Pegong lake in Ladakh in 2006 in front of the Kardungla pass .
In the morning of 27 December we moved out of Delhi with the goal of Jim Corbett , but the Joshkhetesh from which we got out , the sea snow stopped our journey .
The journey between Hapud and Gajauda was very pleasant .
Clouds from above are snow and rods in front
It feels like falling several times .
In a way we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We used to stay in Dikuli near our resort park , whose booking was done before .
There was no special program but despite being cold we went on walking on the edge of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
The night was too late when we came back .
On coming from Delhi we decided that lions roaming in the jungle surely will be seen and I had lions surrounding me in dreams all night .
Suddenly amidst the darkness of the night I heard a loud roar and after that till 2 o'clock in the night the dogs did not stop .
The first opinion was to visit Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfall .
Kalabhangi is 30 kilometres away but Corbett waterfall was on the way .
In the Corbett Saheb museum of Kalambungi many things related to his life have been studied .
Twelve.30 p.m. at night.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has started reaching this village .
When we reached the resort then the jeepsy of the safari had covered us .
He used to make arrangements for sighting in the first Bijrani there .
Asked about number one , it was said that because of the excessive grasshoppers the tiger had come here to protect from cold .
Just as we reached Bijarani, we gave us a guide.
We got ready for the inside forest .
We got ready for the inside forest .
Inside, we saw two Tasker elephants, whose horns were very big.
I took a lot of pictures.
The guide started finding the tiger's way.
Guide told us that there are about 150 tigers in the park near which some died here .
At many places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sad because they could not be seen .
On the third day we had to stay for Delhi .
The whole of my thought was a tiger ride .
Then I remembered my old friend in Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I'm in Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see the tiger or not.
His words slide like a weapon .
I said slowly, no
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park.
Somebody advised me to ride inside.
