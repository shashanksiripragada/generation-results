Considering the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism department is passing through bad governance at this time .
There is a huge obstacle in the tourism industry with increasing dangerous accidents in Vaishvikmandi and South Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in combination with the major countries of the country is particularly less in these days .
The new figures presented recently by the Rajasthan government have said that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 was less than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
In coincidence the number of tourists in the country decreased by 98 . percent and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came together in Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included , because between 2009 two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 people of the country and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with the tourism region think about this situation very well .
Sanjay Kaushik , the editor of Rajputan Holiday Makers said that horrific events like Vaishik Mandi have a bad effect on tourism industry .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . percent in comparison to last year .
Most of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attention of tourism is increasing in Rajasthan throughout the year .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan decreased .
There is nothing new in the point of view of tourism .
Desert , big palaces , forts , wells , forests all are old , to surprise the journey .
In the tourist spot all the governments start descending and climbing to work in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism and adventurous tourism but in this direction nothing has been done .
The facility of travellers coming to Rajasthan is available very less .
At the same time foreigners along with women tourists in Rajasthan in recent times the pictures of this country have been painted at the international level in rebellion and provocative events .
Years before the government of Rajasthan the tourism department had cracked in the country but it remained constricted only in the newspapers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of promoting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
The facility of stay , food , traffic , boating etc . is available for this corporation .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 hotels , eight cafeteria , three lanes , one pocket and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the condition of this pocket has been devastating for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC is 185 lakh and in the next year it is estimated to be 63 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this school is that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels forty square metres will not be filled .
Along with hotels the other units of the hotels also cause a lot of damage to it .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Tourists do not get attracted directly to this train .
Because of less rent it does not attract tourists .
In such a situation on the Pushkar Mela as well the love of the tourists is decreasing .
In 2007 - 08 this fair was built by RTDC in the tourist village where 398 foreign tourists stayed and this year its number was reduced to 217 .
The best thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of the attraction of the tourists of Palace on Hills and Shahi train .
This train continues to be beneficial .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine crore rupees from this train .
It is natural to see the waves of doubt in the tourist spot from this fall in the tourist spot in Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
But if there is a desire to do something in the mind of humans then they make gold from soil .
In the mountain range of Sahyadri of Subradrai Maharashtra situated in the modern city Ambo Valley this can be really seen .

At a height of approximately 4500 feet these beautiful mountainous places charm the heart of the guests .

The eyes fell on the light Arunima coming up in the sky of the skies in the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side .
The wind is very cold .
Together with the cold frozen from the environment wet is also known .
Below the legs looks at the particles of the snow falling at the end of the sound of wood .
The environment is calm , because of the thin light before sunrise nothing could be seen much .
Eyes fell towards the eastern Arunima .
One feels like sitting in a bunch in Balkani .
As soon as the hand smells on the smooth layer of the snow like hardness and the hands drag immediately on feeling cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is my third foreign dwelling in this small village settled in the midst of these mountains covered with snow in Switzerland .
This is my third visit to Swiss.
Before this most of the time Geneba or near it is eaten .
On both the sides of the leafying river the thick populated slopes standing in the valley are spread very high slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , on both the sides of the valley of Ron , many small and big cities are located .
Gradually moving trains can be seen through the parallel national highway of the Ron river .
The distance of 300 kms and half of the journey of two and a half hours in the car is just near the city named Ron river Montre coming in the eastern direction along with the Geneva lake which is called French -LRB- Laclemon -RRB- .
Genevo city is located in the western part of this lake of 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake turned into a river and spread towards the west .
On the other side of the lake on the right is the white and narrow mountain ranges of Alps .
Crossing the right side through a beautiful small town named Luke we reach this highway in the north on the mountain way .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not equal .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not equal .
As soon as it rises up , the luxury of snow increases .
On both sides of the road there is no cold in the wind because of good covering , clear sky and shining sun .
The journey of about 20 kms on this Khumavadar mountain road was ready in half an hour and we reached a small village named Thel .
There are huge iron storeys made of wood in the entire roof slopy with stones .
On the basis of the basement built by the cement concrete of this three storeyed palace along with the parking of trains there is also a department of controlling the required services like electricity , water , cooking .
Right Switzerland is famous for grapes cultivation .
This is the main center of making wine of grapes .
37 percent of the whole of the continent is the cultivation of grapes on the earth .
In the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes give a magnificent expanse to the beauty there .
Go to the garden area of grapes , travel there , rest in the villages there and go to the grape factories and check the sweets , all these are the comprehensive parts of the tourism industry here .
There is a huge collection of grapes in a fort built in the 12th century in a small city of Aigle which foreign tourists book beforehand to see .
Once again our people passed through that desert jungle .
Throughout the way of three to four kilometres the heart gets disturbed by the questions of the frozenness of the children .
Suddenly with a circular scene there is a dramatic and beautiful change .
In fact on the left side of the road in the upper part of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses stands .
In the upper plains of the villages people skiing on snow .
On the top of the skiing slope the dense forest of cedar is spread till the peaks of the mountain .
On all four sides there is a sharp covering .
The roofs of the houses are shining because of the falling of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reached the village .
The same silence is shadowed here .
On all the four sides from the peak of the mountain to the valley there is a confluence of beautiful snow .
In the next five minutes we reach a big round between that small town .
The name of the small city is Lucker Bad .

It is said in Darjeeling that only the taxis of Sikkim go to Sikkim therefore there is no check up .
The journey continues , the region is another , but the mountains are the same .
The cold that trembles the whole body is the same .
The black color of the rainy season is also the same .
When the plan for the journey of Darjeeling was fixed then first decided to see the sight of Karziang .
Karzyang is a small town in Darjeeling .
Tea is full of gardens and is full of dense forests .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
On climbing from Siliguri to Darjeeling in the beginning tea gardens and welcome the people coming there .
While passing through the road amidst tea gardens the heart charms for the first time , is one of the preserved places in the form of wealth .
On one side full of jungles green mountains on the other side is a deep greenery mine .
If there is forest in the middle then tea gardens can be seen in the middle .
All around is the kingdom of greenery .
Once I was confused , see these natural jungles or plants of tea grown by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The more beautiful forests the more beautiful the garden of tea is spread .
If the eyes go on the roads of the road then the creation will be amazing .
Crossed through a narrow and circular road in the shape of snake .
Time also passes .
Forests and tea gardens do not end .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
One can see a lot of magnificence with houses and buildings on a mountain from afar .
It's Karziank.
Staying here at one place we prepared a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is , taking a train to go to Karziang .
First of all, Deer Park.
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To climb up , to reach the deer park the train is descended very low .
Due to being filled with the beauty of Karsiyang , it has not yet been developed in the form of a tourist spot .
Because the city is so good and clean .
After the destruction of the road the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by the jungles and the pleasure of climbing the way between the trees of sunshine gives us adventure .
The next place is Egal Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called Suicide Point .
In the era of the British the cameras used to go from here .
Hilhal is connected with a park and a restaurant .
There is a staired fort here , from above which the whole city can be viewed .
In the nearby tea garden women suffocate in the external intestine and suffocate the tea leaves with hands very soon .
There is a museum outside the Karziank city but on that day we did not go there because it was more necessary to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
Next day we decided to roam in Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience for me , but if it was raining then there was a lot of thought about how to roam around .
But it was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the joy of the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place laden with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is more beautiful than this .
On descending a little from here Gangama was seen surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the magnificence of waterfalls can be seen .
In Rock Garden if the waterfall is shining here with stones and rocky empire then the marvellous world of waterfalls in Gangamaya can be seen magnificent .
Both these places are located very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of the train we saw an unparalleled scene in Darjeeling .
With the help of darshan from here all the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen .
The condition of the weather is still clear .
But if we climb to monastery then we can see the clouds standing .
In the evening somewhere present and brightens .
During the journey of Darjeeling , Town trains also enjoy the journey .
The journey from Darjeeling to Dhum , Dhum to Darjeeling is specially attracted to the tourists .
Here boating in the Mirik lake and a little rest in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath market through this route , where sweater etc . are available with the hand of Nepalese artisans .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is a residence of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegram which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we came to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam around Darjeeling in the shadow of winters then here tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling have linked me to themselves .
In my condition a small journey is very fun and thrilling .
This journey is not foreign but outside Rajasthan because it is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me in which some travel attracts me , but sometimes some specific places like water ships , some royal train or some city like Gulabi city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction attracts people .
The place where we went to do it was prepared about four and a half years ago , but with those preparations this place came there , they really enjoy .
It is not just for the people going there because for the people living there .
In my ears the sound of my guide Rambabu Mina swings , we did not think before this how we lived in the jungle .
Fifty percent workers are also in this area .
Suddenly -LRB- suddenly -RRB- I felt that such a place people do not work in the heritage hotel .
Rambababa , the resident of Ajabgarh , had worked in Jaipur before this , now in this unique Amber filled Amman garden .
He's telling himself that he has turned into a new color.
The master ' is the wall of the Amman garden .
There no one will call you in English domination .
Aman Garden is actually a comfortable and comfortable entertainment center .
That garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that it is known by the neighbouring territory .
How many people spent holidays in Ambra Puri of Rajasthan traveled to Danag of the messengers , why should you go far , some people from the residents of Jaipur sometimes spend the night in this region .
After opening the Amal garden big people from all over the country come there .
Shabana Asmi called me there with great love but I remember that night I didn't go.
Its beauty is different which has reached Dangarh by way of itself .
This time comparatively I came there in the invitation of the guest house of our foreign guests , but those people had spent a magnificent holiday in some time , where they would definitely go to the Aman Park .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar had camped for hunting .
Its construction was done in the tenth and twentyth century .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains is a witness of strong trees .
As you come in , welcome to you in such a way , from which it feels as if you have taken care of the unnatural peace here .
Together with building a rock on Manibandh the mantra of Mangalacharya should be celebrated actively .
We reached La in the evening and planned to roam around this garden .
My guest Jackie fascinated our heart as an adornment and architect .
All are inspired by big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting.
Everything is new and artistic and no wonder .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all along with Rambabu on foot and then the jeep journey of Dangarh .
On walking through the road of Sankari we saw the fort of Ajbagh in which the rays of the sun gradually spread .
On seeing the dry lake the farmers cultivate in it .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackak is a unique experience .
After that we reached Dangarh by jeep .
In the morning I kept watching a tourist of Holland very carefully .
If this is then it is an unprecedented moment for millennium dollars .
The journey of Aman garden is a tradition and tradition , and by giving jaggery and curd they left us .
Now it has been understood that why tourists come here for so much cost .
I have heard that tourism has also been done to see the life of the tribals .
Is it true
Basak is not one such , in many countries and tourists are specially interesting in it .
This tour is usually prepared from four days to two weeks and during this tourists are included in different places .
Wherever it stops , food is included from there .
In such a way an attempt is made to explore such places where there is not much development and there time does not affect the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots there .
Besides this it is also important to distribute traditional kujins .
In fact the meaning of this kind of tourism is to understand the ways and traditions of living in that area .
Although it is a little difficult to think , but such a tourism is a charming and different kind of experience .
It is a pleasure for us to go to the bus .
There are many people in it because you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , if you take books of your choice in this journey then you will get more time when you get disturbed .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less and full comfortable moments this tour will definitely be required from you .
To enjoy it keep in mind some things specially if you see some foreign destination through bus tour .
Before taking a ticket you should find a good deal .
Students , big people of the army , children etc . get benefit in this , but for other people also one gets a discount .
Although there is an arrangement for taking tickets in advance , therefore in the last minute it is very good to organize tourism in the bus but plan should be done shortly .
Although there is an arrangement for taking tickets in advance , therefore in the last minute it is very good to organize tourism in the bus but plan should be done shortly .
It's cheaper.
The routine to take the bag is specially intense , so tell about the size and weight of the things .
Sometimes it does not happen that you will have to leave some of your things in the terminal or then you will have to close more money .
At the same time you should also know the law of paying full amount of insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags should be kept fine and taken away .
Because stiffness comes on the rock above the buttocks .
This thing should also be kept in mind that while busing in the middle of the tour the responsibility of the goods is to be done on its own .
From where you want to climb on the bus you will have to reach there an hour before .
During the interval of smell you should take special care of this thing .
In fact , the sooner you reach , the more you choose the best hips will be with you .
While selecting the hips keep in mind whether there is cough or not .
There is more stiffness in the back hips but it is not a coffertable to read sitting on the front hips .
If you want warm wind many times then you can take the ankles on the sides but if you do not like to be more disturbed then the ankles of the end will be very good for you .
Then one thing of intelligence skills .
But if you are thinking of handling both of them then put a bag on the buttocks by sitting on the buttocks on the first side .
But if you are thinking of handling both of them then put a bag on the buttocks by sitting on the buttocks on the first side .
If there is much busyness in the bus then plan will be successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
While cleaning the bus everyone wants to go out .
At this time do not leave your stuff at all because if it is lost then the bus holders do not take its responsibility .
Whenever you stop the bus then come back on time .
If you do not come in time then your place will be available to some new travellers and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After that if you stay in the mountain then you will get hotels at a little lesser rate but to enjoy the true beauty of Maldives if you go to any island outside nearby then the size will be small .
The sea journey is beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise is the only ship of Maldives Colombo from Kochi .
Louis Cruise is not only the European institution but also the cruise and hotel businesses are very important .
But due to some problems Louis cruise has stopped their services but there is a chance of starting again from October .
At the lowest rate of the ship of Lui Cruise you can go to the end of the Maldives with a minimum of Rs . 5850 per person every night .
That is , the cost of one person for three days is less than 18,000 rupees .
Not only this , if you are two people then the child of less than 15 years of age is totally beneficial .
What else do you want
In the cost of cruise tea and breakfast are included .
And the whole time smile.
On reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the fun and activities available in the Maldives according to the size of the pocket - from sea plane journey to lunch in the middle of the water .
If a flight comes in front of you suddenly after roaming on big planes then you will feel sports .
But the twelve-fifteen-seat twelve-fifteen-seat flights like Maldives are excellent in the form of roaming around the island community .
The speedboat runs on the surface of water when it flys in the air , it can not be known .
In every flight you will not feel like a normal flight .
Your policy will always be below the window - on the various sides of the Maldives watch the resort islands and Koral islands in blue water .
Everything looks very clear.
In Maldives there are two cycling companies .
Trans is one of these in Maldives and they have 20 C flights .
If you want then you can make an air travel of about Rs . 4000 -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or you can hire the entire C . plane throughout the day -LRB- if you want to hire -RRB- .
Otherwise if you are going from Maldives to any other island then it is the best way to travel between different islands for C - air travel .
This journey will never stop you .
C - Airways travels from 12 k . . to 183 k . . in Maldives .
We were at the biggest ancient and magnificent shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
All those who are going to take goods in the market tried very carefully by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference held in Rapan Gan a day ago .
In fact , I have not seen a Hindustani listening to the language of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But it is better to adopt silence because of being the question of the existence of a creature that has been left unconscious of this earth .
In October many people call the convention of water inside the Maldives through the cabinet , but while going to Maldives it feels as if the natural anger bears it from us then how poor the earth will be .
The beauty there has its own speciality .
In that small country such beauty can not be covered .
Returning from that end of the market to go back to your cruise , you can find out how much the people understand this beauty .
The water is so clean that the fishes swimming deep under the light of the rock can be viewed with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
You will be surprised to see some kilometres of clean water in the sea or river water related to any city of India .
After returning to M . . . Aqua Marine there was nothing clear for two hours of the evening spent in Mala .
The snakes are the life here .
Here you will find petals till the stones above the tombs .
We stayed outside his office some time ago to listen to the language of President Nasheed .
We could not believe that we were before the house of the best person of a country .
With immense interest we took pictures of gardens and arches around 50 metres on the one side by the door of his bungalow .
You can imagine this before the house of any leader in India .
It has been found that the President sometimes traveling on foot and two blocks go to his office beyond the road .
All the things related to Maldives were moving towards one side .
Therefore I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning we reached the airport in the cruise .
From there we reached the place named Trams Maldives while roaming through Runway .
Last evening when we were reaching the cruise mall then we returned to the C - plane which went above suddenly .
Several pictures of it were seen .
But we didn't know that the next time we could roam in it .
We had to go to Rangoli Island at a distance of 105 kilometres through Transmall TV C plane .
Seeing hundreds of resorts and pavilion islands spread in the sea of Maldives through a c-air flight flying at a height of approximately 100 metres is a spectacular view .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
With thrill and luxury it was a journey of breathing .
But at the Rangoli Resort of the Hillton Hotels of Rangoli Island we felt as if we had reached another world .
There is another world that does not have any connection with the outside world.
There was also anxiety that such beauty and magnificence could be found somewhere outside .
The journey of Karnad can be possible on foot and on the car running in the battery .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jati to the main island the view of water life was amazing .
Now we came to the place to bear ourselves from the external nature , which was beyond imagination .
With the help of stairs we descended in water a few metres below the sea reached a glass room under the water .
That room was actually a lunch room.
On all the sides small - big fish , potato , snorkelling , scuba diving have also been seen .
While thinking about eating food sitting on decorated tables thrills in us .
On reaching this island by flight from Mala the cost of a person is 47 , 000 rupees to see here and eat lunch under water .
There was no mind to come back from there .
We were ready to wash our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible.
If there is a destiny with a heavy mind then we returned in the belief that somebody would come here again .
For a few days the plan to go out of Delhi was being prepared but it was not possible because of the busy work .
Since childhood wildlife was a zeal , why did not we go to Jim Corbett this time
After cycling till Pegong Lake in front of Cardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 this is the second bike tour .
In the morning of 27 December we left from Delhi for the purpose of Jim Corbett , but from which Joshkhadesh we left , the melting snow stopped our journey .
The journey between Hapud and Gajoda was desperate .
A covered snow from above and a deteriorated rod ahead
I thought it would have fallen several times .
In a way we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 km ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dikuli near our resort park and we used to book it before .
There was no special program but despite winters we went to walk on the edge of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to the Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
When I came back, Ratri was too late .
On coming from Delhi it was decided that the lion roaming in the jungle was definitely visible and I had lions around all night in dreams .
In the midst of the deepness of the night suddenly I heard a deep roar , after that till 2 o'clock in the night the dogs stopped .
First opinion was to visit Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfall .
Kalbhangi is 30 kms away but Corbett waterfall was on the way .
In the museum of Corbett Saheb in Kalabhungi many things related to his life have been kept safe .
It's 12.30 p.m. when you're back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has begun to reach this village .
When we reached the resort , the safari jeepsy was chasing us .
He was organising the facilities for sighting in the old Bijarani there .
Asked about the first number , it was said that because of excessive grass there the leopard had come here to protect from cold .
As soon as we reached Bijarani, we gave us a guide.
We got ready for the inner jungle .
We got ready for the inner jungle .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants, their horns were very big.
I took a lot of steps.
He started finding the way to the tiger.
The guide said that in the park there are only 150 tigers near which some of them died nowadays .
At some places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sorry because we could not see them .
On the third day we had to stay for Delhi .
The whole of my thought was a tiger ride .
Then I remembered my old friend in Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I was in Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see the tiger or not.
These words of him rolled out like a furnace.
I said slowly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike in the park.
Someone advised me to ride inside.
