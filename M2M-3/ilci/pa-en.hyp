Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
It is called ' Kachchi ' .
Although it is ' speaking ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kachchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where several times earthquake has come and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from that path from which we had come then we will have to take a complete one month 's holiday and schools will open there in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now you will travel in the train by calling the fast buses of Gujarat ta ta .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train towards meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to trade slowdown and increasing terrorist dangers in South Asia the tourism trade has reached a deep shock .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be included in the major states of the country has recorded cough reduction in these days .
Statistics released recently by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has come down by more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included while during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 nationals and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism area are specially worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Halde Makers , says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism trade .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong basic framework of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
Because of tourism the best years of recent years have passed for Rajasthan .
After 2008 this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
With the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , buffaloes , forests everything is the same old to enjoy the tourists .
In the tourism sector the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism is done by all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very less .
At the same time along with foreign palaces tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the incidents of batkar and shadow have also marked the image of this state internationally .
Years ago the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of development in the state but it has remained confined to only papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of inviting tourism and developing the basic structure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , transportation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motor , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels have also remained thin for several years .
In 2008 - 09 the deficit of RTDC was 185 lakh whose estimate is to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled in the last five years .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also reaching it a big loss .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
The attraction of tourists towards this train could not be made .
Despite reducing the fare it could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the traveller village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed there this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This railway is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . crore from this train .
With this decline in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the glimpse of concerns in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his heart then he can produce gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it true by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadri of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had seen , while progressing day by day , reflects happiness in his eyes .
This joy of them was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place in the form of a better city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres only 9 percent of the land hotels , houses and other facilities have been built .
91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists are coming forward to build their houses in this city built for crores of people and today almost families are living in this city .
Initially industrialists and residents bought their shelter here in the form of a holiday home but now they have made it their first house and travel to Mumbai for work here .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Leekawali are very important in western Siang district .
Remains of a large temple have been found in excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple idols of lotus and goddesses have been excavated a lot which is in extremely ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very area .
At this place a Dashabhuja statue of Goddess Durga is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpali are still singing the pride of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories one gets the description of the glory of Tameshwari Devi .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognized far and wide in the north - eastern hills .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans was offered which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular stories here this place is ancient Vidarbha , where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahkund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes here , Mishami , etc . guide the tourists .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pond .
Near Brahkund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far and wide come here .
Besides the above ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roying in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roying are still telling their story .
The deficiency of bathing , pucca stairs and another pond being surrounded by cooked curtains and mixing ruins of wide - wide roads are still singing the silence of its ancient magnificence .
We reach ero for four hours by jeep from North Lakhimpur the city of upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subasiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the heart of visitors .
This is the same charming place where catastrophe lives .
It takes several days to reach here before the jeep road is built .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premrose , woolet , wild crant , strawberries and rosary enjoy the visitors .
Apples and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the Apatani people .
With its untiring hard work people have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plain is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of cultivation .
The necessity of their irrigation is fulfilled from the Kali river .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley four folds .
Light redness appears in the sky on white in the middle of the ranges laden with snow of the left hand .
Good cough in air is cold .
Along with the chilling cold in the environment there is also a feeling of moisture .
With the sound of waste - waste below the feet one gets to see the layer of a palm laden on the floor of wood .
There is nirvata in the environment and because of the blurredness of the sunrise before sunrise much is not visible .
Eyes remain pills on the redness of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench lying in the balcony .
On applying hands the smooth layer of the palate gets bitter with the sound of a slight sound and the hand gets separated from the shock with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village settled between these hills buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent Geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the thin Balkhandi river is spread till very high on light slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron 's valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
Equivalent to the Ron river highway and shouting cars have started giving it clear .
The journey of 300 kms away and half an hour from the car is halfway then along with the equivalent of Geneva lake and half Ron river coming from eastern direction along with the Ron river Montro near the city named Geneva lake which is called Lake Lames in French -LRB- Lock Lames -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves ahead towards the west .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of Dhawal , skyscraping Alps across the lake .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the left side we come on the hilly road towards the north leaving this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward the sun of climbing is giving full sunshine to all the slopes .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not equal .
As we move towards the height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite being accumulated good cough on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
On this circular mountainous road we reach a small village named Thel after spending a journey of about 20 kms in half an hour .
There are large multi-storey bungalows with rock slopy roofs , completely made of wood .
In the basement made from the cement concrete tower of this bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladry along with parking of trains .
Walai is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making wine grapes wine .
The cultivation of grapes is done on 37  of the whole cantonment .
The grapes gardens of grapes in the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley give a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Take gardens of grapes to the bottom , touring them , resting night in the villages there and tasting wine by taking grapes into the factories of alcohol is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Age there is a very big museum of grapes wine in a cart made in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to get an advance booking done .
Once again we pass through the same jungle after being ashesed from Davanal .
By the way till three - four k . . the heart gets even more impressed with the buzzing questions of the children .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come from the scene on a turn .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the slope of the deep valley a beautiful crowd of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on sloping the slope from above the village .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope the dense forest of  Mak Deodar ' is spread .
Deep snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also there is a silent shadow .
From the peak of the mountain all around to the valley the empire of Dhawal Himalayas .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round chakra in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Luckerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants for staying for Shaula 1500 .
65 drops of hot water have been found in Luckerabad till now .
40 lakh litres coming out of these everyday up to 510 hot water is transported to the thermal pools of around 30 , some pools are inside five star hotels and according to the pockets of people of different classes .
On reaching the village one feels full heat .
The thick layer of snow is shining on the roof of the houses in the sunshine .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village , Switzerland is one of the safest places in the form of heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling only that Sikkim only taxis of Sikkim can be taken hence there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is the second , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are there , the air is the same .
The moisture of the whole body is the same .
Beautiful light is the same in the rainy season .
The plan of Darjeeling journey is fixed first the decision of Karsyang 's Jhaki was taken .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sun jungles .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning tea garden welcomes those who move towards themselves while spreading Muskurat .
In the middle of tea gardens the heart gets hypnotised for the first time from a road .
On one side the green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side Hagiri is the valley .
Here sometimes the jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I got ruined , see these natural jungles or the tea plants planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens spread far away .
If you look at the road then it looks very marvellous .
The snake 's walk like crooked and vicious paths were going on .
The time was also passing .
If we were not passing then the jungle and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
A hilly house - house etc . was seen very dense from a distance .
This was Karsyang .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming all day .
Therefore we got out on the tour of Karsyang taking a car .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach Deer Park the climb was above i . . the train had to leave very down .
Despite being abundant with the beauty of Karsyang has not yet been developed - famous in the form of a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the passage being deserted the lure of reaching the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the road between the dusty trees was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by skirmishing here .
At present , it is a park and a restaurant .
There is a stair like dome here from the height of which a beautiful view is present on observing the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking tea shoes running hands with extreme speed laden with a basket on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsyang city , but that day we could not go there because touring the free environment of tea gardens was more important .
Next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a big concern with this that if this rains continue to happen then how will we roam .
Magar coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little more down from here we got Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst rocks the beauty of the waterfalls is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stone rocks are charming then the Mayavi world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is divided with stones .
Both of these places are present very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw batsya loop in Darjeeling waking up with the help of the train .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was clear till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , knowing where we were present and started shining .
In the evening there was a plan to roam and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling the toy trains put four moons in the journey .
The journey of toy train from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in the Mirik lake and less rest in the garden .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where Nepalese artisans get handmade sweaters etc .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its form - color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens , but there is traffic of jungles and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist place in Kalimpong is - Lada and Lolegaon , which is full of jungles and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of winter , but tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with us .
My recently a small journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign countries nor of outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey attracts towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or a royal city like a city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of this one special attraction people come to draw .
The place I am going to talk about this bus has been prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation with which this place has come there it has actually made mangal in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there , but also for those who live there .
In my ears my guide resonates the words of Ram Babu Meena , Saheb before this we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work even in heritage hotel .
Ram Babu resident of Ajbgarh used to work in Jaipur this first and now in the Amman Bagh with this unique royal style .
He has sloped his speech in a new color .
Saheb ' is the estimation of Amman Bagh .
There no one calls you English speaking .
Amman Bagh is actually a tourist place with peace and all comfortable facilities .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it makes you know about the surrounding areas as well .
How many people among those who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have visited Bhangarh of the past why go away , even among the people of Jaipur Kuchek would have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Amman Bagh big people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night as well when Shabana Azmi had called me there with Tahdil but I could not go .
It is different that he had reached Bhangarh by wandering his own way .
This time suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guest , then I felt that those people who want to spend a magnificent holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen , hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is a witness of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Amman Bagh hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside you are welcomed , it feels that attention has been given to the divine peace here .
Along with the Mauli dam in Kalai the mantra of Mangalacharan is done alive .
We had reached Dhaul in the evening we intended to apply a cycle to that garden .
My mejaban which is begging , suddenly spoke , ' This is interesting ' .
All the palaces and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything new and artistic has not been surprised that Amman Bagh has also got the award recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all walking with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
We saw the fort of Ajbgarh walking on a cycling road on which the light of the sun was spread gradually .
Seeing the dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
If for this then such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollars priceless moment .
The way to say Alvida of Amman Bagh was also traditional jaggery and curd by feeding us .
Now it has come to know why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show travel life .
Is this right
Of course this happens not only in many states and tourists also show cough interest in them .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and there has not been a special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time where old tourist sites are also present .
Besides this , attention is given to the service of traditional cougene .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists aware of the ways of living and traditions of that place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this despite being with a lot of people you can enjoy touring alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without distracting your favorite book .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving a lot of time for less expenditure and peace these tours definitely keep the demand of perseverance from you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to take care of some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Take the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc . get discount on them , then for two people also there is an arrangement of discount .
However , buying tickets in advance is cheap , therefore in the last moment it is better to plan bus tours that plan a little ahead .
Know about the round trip instead of the tower ticket .
It falls cheaper .
The rules regarding the bags are very tough hence ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your goods on the terminal or you have to fill the extra percent .
Along with this go to the rules of insurance or loss of tour company also .
Carry on bags are right , but walk .
Because they fit in the rake above the seat .
Keep in mind that while checking the bus during the tour you will have your own luggage of goods .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the busy season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
While selecting the seat keep in mind the confrontation .
If you feel more shocking on the back seat then reading on the seats ahead is not concerted .
If you have to go to Loo again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more distracted then the seat with window will be better for you .
Now it is a matter of drive .
If you enter the distance of both the weapons then first sit on a seat with a corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then planning will remain .
If there is a facility of bassroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while chewing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity with the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the sanitation of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance busmen do not take its responsibility .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then some new traveller can get a new place in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is connected with its own beautiful sea shores and diverse water sports which is like a heaven for the tourists where with the tour of ancient churches one gets to see the beauty of ancient times easily .
Located in the capital of Goa Panchim the Ginger Hotel makes the journey of the western shore excellent .
Ginger hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend comfortable days while enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa .
To see in today 's date the cheapest return fee from Delhi for Maldives is 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Mala then even then you can get hotels at a little less fare but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives go to any island nearby then pocket will become small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Loui Cruise from Kochi started the solitary Cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Though due to some difficulties Louis Cruise has now established its services , but from October it is expected to be resumed .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Louis Cruise , MV Aquarein .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two elders then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else is needed .
The fare of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food .
Entertainment of every time gather .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pockets - from plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a single plane stands in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplane then you will feel like a toy .
But this twin overplane with 12 - 15 seats is excellent in the form of archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- to roam around like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air while running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of common airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep looking at the blue water of different sheds of Maldives seeing resort islands and coral islands .
How clear is everything visible .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these which has twenty sea planes .
If you want then you can travel for an hour in approximately thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or the whole sea plane can be taken on rent for the journey of your day -LRB- condition is full of pockets -RRB- .
If you go to any island beyond Male Island then the journey of C plane will be necessary because this is a journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which may never have the desire to end .
C Plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilevaru in Uttam -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenire shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Male .
All the cellsmans were listening to the speech given by the President of the Maldives Mohammad Nashid in Copenhagen a day ago at the World Climate Convention .
If we say honestly then no Indian has seen the speeches of President or Prime Minister listening so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unusual creation of this earth , then such a seriousness was unnecessary .
Many people may have understood the meeting held inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but going to Maldives it feels that if the wrath of nature finishes it with it then how much will the world become .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In that small country as if it does not gain so much beauty .
Returning towards Jetty from that tour of the market to go back to its cruise , when the sight went in the water of the sea walking along with the burbus circus then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty to what extent .
The water was so clear that in the light of the lamppost the fish floating in several metres deep was clearly visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see some centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself as dry fortunate .
While returning to M . . Aquamarin two hours in the evening spent in the garland were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- marble rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get marble rocks on the stones on the graves .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nashid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the best member of any country , there was no security worker till far and wide .
With fun we were pulling the photographs of gardens and verandas just 50 metres away by spreading our hands inside the gate of his bungalow .
That you can think about the house of such a leader in India .
It was also known that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot two blocks reach his office ahead .
Everything about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
It seemed that that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached Trans on the base of the Maldives by cutting the round of the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Mala then we were passing through the top immediately recognized the plane .
So many pictures that were seen , of them .
But then it was not known that next day it would get an opportunity to ride in it .
From the C plane of Trans Maldives we were going to go to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away .
It was amazing to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from Sea Plane flying till a height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was an adventurous flight that stopped breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Kornad Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island we felt as if we reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no resident from any outside world .
The residents were not even in such a way that it was difficult to get out the beauty or luxury like there .
Tour on Kornad can also be done on foot or by a battery-driven car .
While going from Jetty to main island on both sides of the bridge the view of water life was unique .
Now we could not even easily do ourselves from the nature of the surroundings , that we reached such a place , it was a periodic .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides across the glass we could see people doing unique kinds of small fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing it and lunching underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for a person coming to this island from Mala to C plane .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But we knew that it was not possible .
Returned with this hope with heavy mind that roaming sometimes , sometimes , on some fold you will definitely take a fashion .
They were planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to evening arrangements it was not possible .
Since childhood there was a joy of wildlife then thought that why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla Pass in Laddakh .
On the morning of 27 December we departed from Delhi to Jim Corbett , but the zeal with which the Kore had come out made our speed Raphu Chakra .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tired .
From above Kora and bad roads in front .
Many times we felt that we fell now .
Somehow reached Gajraula at eight in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near the park , whose booking we had already got done .
That day there was some special program not but despite being cold we first went to tour the edge of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours Corbett Museum came out , which was near Dhangadi Gate two kilometres away very difficult .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar below .
It became quite evening while returning .
It had come out from Delhi that if I would definitely see a lion roaming freely in the jungle then I would see a lion in the dream of the whole night .
Suddenly I heard a strong shout between the depths of the night and after that the dogs who started screaming then did not quiet for two hours .
Therefore first suggestion of touring Kaladungi and Corbett Fall came .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , while Corbett Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi , where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
Returning turned at twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled after coming to this village .
On reaching the resort the journey gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged siteing in number one site Bijrani there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more Grassland and during this time tigers come to that side to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for four hours to roam .
We left inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , whose long teeth were .
I rushed to photography .
In the middle of this the guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad because of not getting the sight of the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the fountain of the tiger was riding .
Then only I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I took him a similar phone .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
Whether he saw the tiger asked or not .
His words were astonished like an arrow .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a journey inside .
During the journey we came to know that due to being busy highway near the park often animals get injured or die .
