Their language looks different from Gujarat .
Yeah, it's different.
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat , so in language also there are mixtures of both .
This language is called Kachchi .
However there is no script in this language .
If you want to write Kutch then you have to write it in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquake occurred and the whole city was destroyed .
Near Anjar itself is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer - Tural is very thrilling .
If we want to return through that road then we will have to take a second month 's holiday and on the other hand schools will open in Bombay .
So what can be done  This time we will travel the train with the speedy buses of Gujarat .
From Bhuj the small train of meter gauge reaches Rajkot .
From there another train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad the big train of Broad gauge will reach Bombay .
Considering the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism industry is going through very bad conditions today .
Due to the danger of increasing dangers in recession and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the number published recently by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last 2009 is less than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to the number the number of native tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent less .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 lakh 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were in comparison to them in comparison to the total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried because of this situation .
The director of Rajputa Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik said that due to the incidents of business depression and terror tourism business has been very badly affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop strong based structures and structures in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India is 3 . 29 percent less in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is the highest .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
This year has been cut very well from the point of view of tourism .
After 2000 this first time the number of tourists of Rajasthan decreased .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
For desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forest tourists everything has been kept in ancient condition .
In the field of tourism , rural tourism , treatment related tourism , thrilling tourism all the governments have increased but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less opportunity .
With foreign tourists women in Rajasthan in the last few years the incidents of defamation and disturbances have also made the pictures of this state bad at the international level .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state several years ago but it was limited to paper only .
One example of the success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To increase tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism base the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1997 .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 singles in this corporation .
Among which 39 hotels , 22 motors , eight caphatria , three travellers , one journey alone and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the situation of this corporation has become bad for a few years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was Rs . 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel condition of this corporation is such that in the last five years even forty percent houses of this hotel have not been filled .
Along with hotels other singles of the corporation have also faced big losses than this .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
The attraction of tourists towards this railway has not been made .
Even after decreasing rent it could not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair has been seen less .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 the number of foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC this year has decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train has shown some deficiency in the attraction of tourists .
Due to these railways there is immense benefit .
In the last year RTDC has received nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
In the field of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to be disturbed by these losses .
Tourism is the biggest source of Rajasthan 's economy .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from the earth .
Subrata Roy has proved it by making modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dreams that he had dreamed , he feels happy in his eyes by seeing a little successful everyday .

The work of Ambo Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a beautiful city .
Spread in more than 10 thousand acres this city has made hotels , houses and other facilities on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Several entrepreneurs have come forward to build their houses in this city made for crores and today there are about 800 families in this city .

This place is the headquarters of Lower Subbasiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the visitors .
This is the charming place where Apatanis live .

This place is called the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plain is a living example of their hard work and the technique of farming .
From the Kali river the necessity of irrigation gets over .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls in the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side towards the light lalima emerging in the sky .
The wind is very cold .
In the weather humidity is also felt in Kankan with cold .
After listening to the sound of Kachhar below the tree looks towards the palanquin bed on the table of wood .
Nothing can be seen more in the weather because of depression and humbleness before sunrise .
The vision gets stuck on the retina of the east .
He wants to sit on the bench kept in Baranda .
On applying hands light sound of the shiny layer of the palate starts shining and hands move as soon as they feel cold .
Thousands of miles away from their country this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village in the middle of this mountain covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss.
Before this Geneva had spent more time than this or around it .
Located on both the sides of the valleys of the Saru river the dense population is spread till far above the slight slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley , on both sides of which many small and big cities are located .
On the highways and roads along the Ron river the car is clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kms and half an hour by car is parallel to the Geneva lake and the Ron river coming from eastern side along with the Ron river Mondro which is called French Lake Lema mixes with it .
Geneva city is located at the western end of this lake 100 km long and 10 km wide .
The lakes here move towards the west through the river again .
The mountain ranges of Dhabal , Gaganchumbi Alps beside the liability and lakes .
After reaching a beautiful small city named Leuk we left by exit on the left side , leaving the highway we reached on the mountainous roads towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - face the sun gives full sunshine at noon .
In comparison to the valleys the quantity of snow here is not almost like that .
As much as the height goes , the density of snow increases .
Despite the accumulation of good snow on both the sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and bright sun .
After finishing the journey of approximately 20 kms on this rotating hilly road we reached a small village named Thel .
Shaile - This is a large multi-storied bungalow made of full wood with slope roofs .
In the basement made of this three storied bunglow there is also a room for controlling necessary services like cart , water , laundry .
Switzerland is famous for cultivation of grapes .
This is the main center of wine - grapes making alcohol .
The total cultivation of grapes is done on 37  land of Canton .
The gardens of grapes in the village situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley give a unique look to the beauty there .
Taking them to the gardens of grapes , roaming around , resting in the villages there and taking them to the factory of making wine of grapes and is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named earlier there is a big museum of wine of grapes in a village built in 12th century , to see which foreign tourists keep booking premier .
Once again we are going through the deserted jungles of Daban .
The road till three - four k . . was getting worse in the question of the children .
Then the dramatic and charming changes of the scenes come in a turn .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road there are many houses .
People skiing on the top of the village .
On the skiing slope till the head of the mountain the dense jungles of deodar trees are spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining by the sun rays .
In five minutes we reached the village .
There is also that depression spread here .
From the peaks of the mountains to the valleys on all the four sides the empire of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round chakra in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Liukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Liukarabad is approximately 1500 .
The total number of tourists , sportspersons and sports persons coming here from 6900 beds capable of apartments and shawls , 28 hotels for staying for 1500 people , camping site for copper leaves , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants can be estimated .

One feels hot on reaching the village .
In the bright sunlight the thick level of snow is shining on the roofs of the house .
The name of this village is Alvenin .
Alvenin village is one of the conserved places in the form of national importance in Switzerland .
It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to taxi therefore no checking is done .
The journey is going on , the state is another , but the mountains are the same , trees are also one , the wind is the same .
The moisture in the veins of the whole body is also one .
The brightness of the weather is also one during rainy season .
As soon as the plan for the journey of Darjeeling is ready , it is decided to take the swing of carsing .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of dust filled with tea gardens is full of jungles .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
On moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the first tea garden welcomes you in the form of laughter .
In the middle of the tea gardens the heart became pleased to go through the road for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungle and on the other side deep green valleys .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen here .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once I had fallen in trouble - I will not see these natural jungles but trees of this tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle was the gardens of expansive tea .
If you look at the road then it feels amazing .
The roads like snake rice were going on tara and virtual roads .
The time was also flowing .
The gardens of jungle and tea which were not cut .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance a hilly house , house , etc . were seen to be a lot of intensity .
This was Carciang .
Staying at one place here we made a program of touring throughout the day .
Therefore with a car we went out to roam carsing .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge jungles all around .
The front was Chadai i . . to reach the deer park one had to leave the car far below .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsing it has not yet been developed or famous in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very clean .
Despite the road being deserted the pleasure of reaching till the deer park surrounded by the jungle and climbing the road between the dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
This is called Suside Point .
It is said that during the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a dome here from above which a beautiful view can be seen from the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women are capable of taking a toker on the back and keeping their hands very fast .
There is an exhibition outside the city of Karsiang , but on that day we could not go there because the tour of the open weather in the tea gardens was very important .
The next day it was decided to roam around Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling , but there was a lot of thought that if such rains happen then how to roam around .
But the connectivity was very good that on reaching till Rock Garden we could get the benefit of sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is more charming than this .
On going a little down from here Gangamaya surrounded by mountains will be found .
Here the magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we got to see that the waterfalls are decorated here in the empire of stones and the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is found in stones .
Both these places are sitting below the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of cars we saw the air loops in Darjeeling .
From here the entire mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The taste of the weather was still good .
But as we moved towards the monastery , who knows where the clouds came and started shining .
In the evening plans of walking and shopping in Malrode were made .
Toy train journey in Darjeeling makes the journey even more attractive .
The journey of toy train from Darjeeling to sleep and from sleep to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake and some rest in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on this way , where sweaters etc . made by Nepalese artists are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district but its colorful form is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but there is a sound of jungle waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolehgaon , which are full of jungle - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam around Darjeeling in winters but the tea gardens spread from Shiliguri to Darjeeling tied me in ourselves .
My recent journey was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was neither foreign nor was it very close to Jaipur outside Rajasthan .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes the journey attracts us , sometimes some special place , water ship or some magnificent train or some city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people get attracted .
The place I am going to talk about it has been built about four and a half years ago , but the preparation that this place has been made indeed is worth enjoying in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who live there .
In my ears even today while talking about my guide Ram Babu Mina ' Sahiba before that we could not even imagine that we could stay in my jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not even get the job of heritage hotels .
The resident of Ajbagarh Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before this and now this magnificent monastery is gardened .
He said his walk and said that he has made a new structure in a different structure .
Sahiba is a glimpse of Aman Bagh .
There no one feels you in English .
Aman Bagh is really a place of peace and comfort .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces the surrounding places .
There is no need to go away , even among the residents of Jaipur , very few people have spent nights in this area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi invited me there but I could not go .
It is different from the fact that he had gone to Bhangarh wrongly on his own road .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , it seems that those who want to spend a good holiday in less time should go to such a garden .
This garden is one of those seven gardens where the kings of Albar used to take rest for hunting .
It was built in nineteen or twenty .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first sight of Aman Bagh will hypnotise you .
The way you enter inside you will be welcomed it will feel that attention is paid here on the divine peace .
The Mantra of Mangalachar is demonstrated alive with the tied Mauli in the hands .
We reached at noon and decided to put a square on the garden .
My table John Jackie , who spoke with a decorator , is very charming ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is the light decoration here .
Everything is new and artistic . It is not surprising that Aman Bagh has been awarded in recent times .
The administrator fixed our program for the morning .
First of all roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then roamed on the jeep of Bhangarh .
While walking on the road of Kankara we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spread slowly .
I saw Sukhi lake in which the farmers are cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time I saw the cultivation of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life for Jackie was very pleasant .
After this we went to Bhangarh after jeeping .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars time.
While leaving Aman Bagh they told us farewell by eating jaggery and curd in traditional way .
Now we got to know why tourists come here to spend so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also prepared to see the lives of the tribals .
Is it right.
Certainly this is not the same in many states and tourists show special enthusiasm in this tour .
This tour is generally prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying there , eating etc are also included .
In this way an attempt was made to tour such places where there was not much development where there was no special effect on the lifestyle of nature and humans .
Along with this ancient tourist site etc . are also there .
Besides this attention is also given to feeding breastfeeding .
Actually , the purpose of this kind of tour is to make the tourists face the customs and traditions of living at these places .
Although it feels a little difficult to think but this kind of tour is really thrilling and a different kind of experience .
There is a different joy of traveling by bus .
Despite being with many in it you can enjoy staying alone .
Not only this in this journey you can read for a long time without interruption without your favorite book .
Yes , it is right that along with spending many times in less expensive and peace this tour claims to all of you .
To enjoy this tour one needs to remember some things specially when you are watching a foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc . get discount in this tour and there is a facility of leave for both .
However , tickets are slightly cheaper from before , therefore in the end it is done better than planing a bus tour .
Instead of taking both the tickets take information about round trips .
It falls cheap .
Regulations related to goods are done specially therefore ask about the weight of the goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your goods in the terminal itself or pay increase in rent .
Along with this know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags should be taken properly for this tour .
Because it stops him above the seat .
Keep in mind this thing that while changing the bus during the tour you have the responsibility of luggage .
From where you get to the bus reach there one hour before the scheduled time .
During the busy season you will remember this specially .
Actually , as soon as you reach you will get a better seating place .
Keep in mind the rest while selecting the seating place .
There is a lot of swing towards the back and one can not fall properly towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards the corner and if you do not like to be too disturbed then it will be better if you take a seat towards the window .
It's a trick.
If both of you are trying to get rid of then first sit in the seat of the corner and keep your bag in the nearby seat .
If there is no crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the place to sit because sitting there becomes difficult after some time .
Interact with bus driver or conductor .
By this you will be able to know many important information .
While cleaning the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this time you will not leave your luggage in place because after losing it the residents do not take charge of it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the right time .
If you do not come in time then you can take your place a new traveller and you will have to wait for other buses in the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe then you did not see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is famous for a glorious city of ancient Europe and many things .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of the oldest cities of the world from where civilization has developed .
This is the reason why its marks are seen above the western civilization .
Rome situated on the banks of the Taiwar river , is a pilgrimage for Roman Catholic followers because the main Pope of this religion is the residence of Rome .
Ancient Rome was situated on seven mountains .
A wall , sarvial wall was built around it in the fourth century .
The ruins of this are still visible around Rome .
Rome is famous all over the world for ancient buildings and several ruins .
This city with magnificent palaces , beautiful churches , beautiful fountains , domes and magnificence hypnotises in the first sight .
This huge and unique building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy , Divya Victor Emanuel was started in 1885 and ended in 1911 .
In front of it is a idol sitting on the horse of Emperor Imanuel which takes 20 years to build .
Here the graveyard of unknown soldiers who were martyred in the First World War was given .
The carvings of this memorial and the victory marks made on it are worth visiting .
This is also a museum .
If you are interested in artefact then you must see it .
Along with the memorial not only is the famous and magnificent curve of not only Rome but the whole of Italy is ' PAJ Venezia ' .
This curtain made in the middle of Rome is famous like the Vijay Chauk of Delhi .
Besides this Piyatsa de Spagana is also very popular for the tourists where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying PAJA Venezia you must go to the famous road of Rome i . . Via Del Coursey .
The big shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the beauty of this road .
This road is the main road of Rome .
This unique building is built on the Capitoline Hill and is situated at a very high height .
For climbing this the famous statue of the stairs Michael Angelo was built in 1536 AD .
In front of Capitoline sitting on a horse is the idol of Peetal of Emperor Marcus Arellius who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 AD .
This beautiful idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capitoline is also a different identity of this building .
There is also a church , magician and old temple in the Capitoline complex .
The symbol of Rome is calcium .
The construction of this huge Akhara was done in 80 AD and here 50 thousand viewers can sit together .
In Calcium gladiator i . . swords show their duties .
It does not happen in itself , it used to fight with wild animals .
If you wake up in mind this fight , be it with other swordmen or animals , till the death of somebody or the other continues .
There were many forts in ancient Rome .
It was not said that the place of meeting was called forum .
Here only all the social , religious , economic , political activities of the city used to happen .
Among these the most famous fort was Romanam and the ruins of Raj Bhavan , temples and pillars are still there in this place .
Seeing these the importance of ancient Rome can be judged very well .
Panthian - This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 AD .
In the middle of its huge dome is an open place of 30 feet .
For this place devotees felt that their prayers are reaching directly till the goddess .
Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are made all around .
However in 601 AD this temple was converted into a church .
There are many gardens in Rome but Bhila Borgis is incomparable .
Therefore do not forget to see it if you go to Rome .
Definitely go to the magic here because if you do not see it then you will lose the opportunity to see beautiful statues .
The idol built here is unique and so alive that it feels as if it will be said now .
Here the first sister of Nepolian Pollin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis royal family , a idol of sleeping in the palanquin looks so alive that you can not look at one point for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is the fountains here .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which there are beautiful fountains .
The most famous fountain here is Trivi fountain .
It is believed that if somebody goes to Rome again then one should pay one rupee to this fountain with some consciousness .
By doing this desires are fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city is not complete until you have seen Vatican City .
This place in the sixth century is the residence of the most religious main Pope of the Roman dynasty .
Although this is situated in Rome but in 1926 AD an independent city was given the status of a city .
Definitely see the famous St . Peter Church , St . Peter Square , Fountains , Museums etc . of Vatican City .
Actually this will show you the view of a different world and you always feel the feeling of remembering .

That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If they are two adults then the children of less age are free .
What else do you want .
The fare of cruise is tea - breakfast , food .
Always with entertainment .
Reaching the capital Mall you can enjoy entertainment , activities according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming around the big airport suddenly you will feel like playing a sea plane in front of you .
But this twin overplane with a place of 12 - 15 seated islands like Maldives is excellent in the form of uninterrupted tour .
One can not know when suddenly it gets up in the air running on the water like a speed boat .
In the whole of the flight you feel to climb on ordinary air .
Always your eyes will be below - watching the resort islands and Prawal islands in different kinds of blue water of Maldives .
Everything is so clear .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these which has 20 C planes .
If you want you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an hour or you can hire the entire sea plane for the whole day -LRB- for that one should have a tax force -RRB- .
If you go from Male Island to any other island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because there is only one way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want to finish .
The sea plane from 12 kilometres to Suru till 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilevaru -RRB- is done on Maldives island .
We were in the shops of the capital 's biggest antique and swineer in the Ahmadi market of Mall .
All the Salesmans had listened to the speeches given by the President of Maldives in Copenhagen a day earlier in the World Climate Conference .
In fact , I have not seen the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister in any Hindustanique so much .
But when there is a question of creating a new existence on this land then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people will feel like going to Maldives to see the meeting held under the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October even if the cop of nature touches it from us then the world will become so poor .
There is a special thing in the beauty there .
In these small countries it does not seem to be so beautiful .
While going towards Jetty to return from that tour of the market to Cruise again when we came to know how much the people here understand the value of this beauty .
The water is so clean that in the light of the lamppost colorful fish is visible several metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
You are fortunate to see some centimetres clean in the water of the sea or river connected with any city of India .
The evening spent in Male was spent two hours in the evening to come to the Amby Aquamine .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will be able to get an inflammation on the numbers .
Shortly before listening to the speeches of President Nashis we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the house of the highest personality of any country , no security worker was going to see till far .
We were enjoying taking photographs of gardens only fifty metres away by raising hands inside the gate of his bungalow .
Can you think about any leader's house in India
It was also known that the President had ever crossed the road on foot and went to his office two blocks before .
Everything is impressed about Maldives .
That is why we were waiting for Brussberry the next day .
It seems that this day would be special .
In the morning we took a boat from the cruise to our airport island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the square of the queue .
Next day when the cruise was reaching near the goods in the evening then we had come to know the flights going above immediately .
I saw a lot of pictures .
But then did you know that the next day we got the opportunity to climb this plane itself .
On the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were going to Rangoli island situated at a distance of five kilometres .
On this sea plane flying at a height of about thousands of resorts and Koral islands spread in the sea of Maldives were unforgettable .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
In thrill and excitement there was a flight to stop breathing .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hillton Hotel on Rangoli Island we felt as if we had come to some other world .
In such a world which has no relation with the outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and luxury obtained here is difficult to get out .
The tour of Korad can be done on foot or on a battery-driven car .
From Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was unique .
Till now we could not get up with the nature of the surroundings , we reached such a place which was incomparable .
After descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a house of glass which was under water .
This house was actually a food room .
On all the sides small fish , coral , snorkelling and scuba diving people were seen on the other side of the glass .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated floor there is very thrilling .
On coming to this island on the plane from Male the fare of seeing it and lunching underwater is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I was not trying to return from there .
We were ready to wet our passport in water .
But we knew that it was not possible .
With sad mind we returned with this hope that sometimes , sometimes luck will definitely bring here .
I was planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but it was not possible because of the busyness of work .
Wildlife had a lot of fun in childhood hence I thought this time let 's go to Jim Corbett .
Before Khardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 this was the second bike tour after bikeing till Peng lake .
On 27 December we came out from Delhi for Jim Corbett but the enthusiasm that came out with had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajrola was very tired .
Again there is a desperate and bad road .
Many times it felt as if we had to fall .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres before Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Tikuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was no special program , despite being cold we first went to roam around Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was near Ghangadi Gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
We got back in the evening .
I had come out from Delhi firmly that I would definitely see the tiger roaming in the jungle but all night I saw the tiger in dreams .
Suddenly I heard a loud voice in the night and then the dog who started crying started walking for two hours .
Initially advice came to visit Kaladungi and Corbett fruits .
Kaladungi is situated at a distance of thirty kilometres , Corbett Falls falls on the road itself .
There is an exhibition house of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi , where some special things related to his life are kept .
On returning we got at twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village itself .
After reaching the resort safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they have made arrangements for sighting in Saint Bijrani number one .
It is said to ask about number one that there is more grass and tigers come to this direction to escape from cold at this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guidance that to roam around four hours we will take two and a half rupees .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many kinds of animals and deer species there .
Inside we saw the elephant of both the teeth , which had long teeth .
I picked up the ground .
In the middle of this the guides started trekking tigers .
The guide told that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park , many of which died in these days .
At many places we got to see the footprints of the tiger , but the heart was deteriorated due to lack of sight of the tiger .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
The ghost of the tiger was suppressed in my head .
That is why I remember an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him like this.
I told him that Corbett was here .
He asked if I saw the tiger .
His word was buried like a shore .
I said slowly that I didn't see .
There was no permission to take a bike between the parks .
One told us to take a safari to roam inside .
