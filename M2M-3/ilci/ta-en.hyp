This way every year the interest of tourists starts decreasing .
In the year 2007 - 2008 the number of foreign tourists stayed in the R . . . formed tourism organization in which this year the number of tourists was 217 .
In the midst of all this there is no doubt that R . . . 's fun Palace on Wheels i . . attracting the tourists roaming in the beautiful train .

Staying at one place here we make a program for roaming throughout the day .
That is , by taking a car you can go out roaming around Karsiyang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by jungles all around .
The train is very low to reach from the mountain .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsiyang the development of tourism is no longer visible .
However , the city is very good and clean .
The path is unforgettable , surrounded by jungles and reaching till the deer park , going through the road between the lust and trees in the sun gives us a pleasant feeling .
The next place was Isalkar .

In the nearby tea garden women were swinging tea by moving their hands to the jungles by changing the tail behind them .
There is a museum outside Karsiyang city , but those days we should not go out because it is very important to go to tourism according to the environment of tea gardens .
The next day was touring Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but this is a big concern that how to roam around while raining here .
We roam around in the light sun on reaching Rakh Park , but unprecedentedly it was very good .

The effect of some time has not happened in Kalimpong this way .
We came to Darjeeling in winters , where the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling had built us .
I got a lot of interest and thrill from this small journey .
This journey is not only foreign but also near Jaipur outside Rajasthan .
Tourists enjoy one thing in itself , in which whenever the journey draws towards itself then continuously one important place , water ship , or some city like a train or a rose city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are attracted .
The place I said was built about four and a half years ago , in fact along with this organization these places make jungles pleasant .
Not only to go there but to stay there .
In my ears the word of Rambabu Meena reflects that if we were unable to think before this then we live in the jungles like this .
50  employees are in this area .
Suddenly people coming here did not even work in the Heritage Hotel .
The resident of Akbar , Rambabu had worked before this in Jaipur and now in this unique amazing garden of Amman .
He gave a new shape while talking to himself .
Sahiba is the estimation of Aman Garden .
There nobody calls himself in English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist place with all the best facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it also introduces its nearby areas .
For spending holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people have to go away from the bang of flowers , some of the Jaipuris may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of Aman Garden many people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night when Sabna Asmi called me interested but I could not go .
If they had come to Pangarh after finding their own way then this is a different kind .
This time suddenly with the call of my foreign guests I felt there when these people want to spend a good holiday in less time so that they should definitely go to Aman Garden .
This garden is preserved in the seven gardens and is a separate garden where Alwarraj had gone to the hunt .
Its construction was done in the 19 - 20th century .
Its old wall is witness of those days .
Aman Garden surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees charms itself in the first part .
In the same way you will be welcomed in the same way , so it is said that you can experience a very peaceful environment here .
The Mangalasar Mantra is highlighted at a rapid pace with the construction of rocks in Manikarn .
We reached Dalle in the evening and intended to roam around that garden .
My guest Jackie is decorating and speaking immediately , so it was interesting .
All the palaces and palaces are attracted with lighting .
Everything is beautiful .
There is no surprising point in getting the award for Aman Garden because all are modern artistic .
The manager gave us our program for the morning .
First of all we walked on foot with Bapu and then we traveled in the jeep for Banghat .
On reaching the narrow road we saw the fort of Akbar in which the sun was spread gradually .
On seeing in the dry lake the farmer was cultivating in it .
This year because of not raining we saw tobacco field for the first time .
The rural life of Jog was such a unique experience .
After that we went to Bangkok through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist spot sitting very carefully .
These are the invaluable moments of dollars .
From Aman Garden also the tradition of Alvita had given us the answer by giving jaggery and curd .
Tourists can now know why to spend so much here .
I was told that for seeing the life of tribals a tourist group was formed .
Is it right
Surely this is found in some states and tourism has a special interest in it .
This tourism is organised generally from 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
How to stay there in it .
In such a way an attempt is made to do such explanation where there is no excessive development and there is no special role in the lifestyle of the nature and the people .
At the same time there are also ancient tourist species there .
Besides this attention is also given to surveillance of guzzin in treatment .
In fact such a tourism lovers can see the lifestyle and tradition of that place directly .
Though it is very difficult to think , but such a tourism gives interest in going and gives a different experience .
Tourists are very enjoyed by bus .
Even if you see a crowd here then you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can also take a long time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with giving less cost and peace all the time this journey definitely gives us the request for satisfaction .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things at the main time when you are watching some foreign destination bus tourism .
Before taking a ticket search for a best team .
Students , military people , children , etc . get tickets here for both the people there are arrangements prepared for both .
In the same way it is better to buy the prescribed travel ticket therefore in the last cars it is better to make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling they tell about round trips .
The cost of the morning is also less .
It is very important to take things , hence ask about obesity and weight .
You leave some of your substances with temporary or then you fill up electronic substances .
Also take the enjoyment of insurance or loss from the tourism team .
Take Kerry on Bax facility .
Because it can be applied in the rock above the seat .
Keep in mind this thing that during the tourism the responsibility of changing things from the bus is yourself .
Wherever you have a bus , go one hour before that time .
If you are busy season then keep this thing in the main phase .
Actually the sooner you go , the better seat structure is near you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the facility .
Take the back seat too much but there is no facility of reading in the front seat .
If you have to urinate again and again then take a distant seat , if you do not want to have much trouble then it will be better for you to sit near the door .
Now there is a mechanical thing .
If you both sit in the seat sitting then first sit in the seat of the corner and keep your back on the other side .
Therefore if there is no crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if there is facility in the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing that after some time it is difficult to sit there .
Introduce bus drivers and conductors .
This way you will get enough information .
While cleaning the bus all come out .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because if it is lost then the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Where the bus stands , go back on time .
If you do not go on time then you can see some new traveller in your place and you have to expect another bus .

Inside the temple all around the temples are kept .
In the same way this temple was converted into a church in the 601st century .

Every time you are watching below the window , below the different sets of Maldives see the reservoir islands and Goral islands in the water .
How many two c-blain companies are all there .

The journey of C Blain from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres is done in Maldives .
We were in the most Antik and Sovenier shops of the capital of the Ahmadi Bazar of Maldives .
All the cellsmen have been listening to the words given by the President Mohammad Nasit of Maldives in the Cave Hall a day earlier with great attention .
I am confident that no Indian has heard the speeches of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a challenge in the state of a strange creation of this earth then it is so terrible .
Some people go to Maldives by the cabinet of Maldives to know the magnificence of water and go to Maldives because the wrath of nature from us is how poor the world becomes .
In the beauty there are some such specialities .
There is no such magnificent tomb in that small country .
After roaming around the market they return towards the jetty to go to their guruj then compulsoryly paying attention to the road the food of sea water takes place because the people here know this beautiful amazing boundary .
The fishes swimming in a few metres deep below the light of Lamp Pong are presenting a glimpse with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is connected to the city .
If you are able to see some centimetres clean in the river or sea water connected to any city of India then you can enjoy yourself .
Returning to M . . Akwamerin in the evening of spending time in Maldives roam around Jagan for two hours .

In order to hear President Nazi ' s lectures we were standing outside in some government huts .
We were before the residence of the chief of the best position of one country , till a long time there was no security because we could not believe .
We were taking photographs on the garden and footpath at a distance of about 50 metres after spreading the hands inside his terrible gate .
Can you think like this by taking some ordinary head to the house in India
It is said that the president had always come to his office before two blocks crossing the roads .
In the matter of Maldives everything is sufficient .
That is why I was expecting the next day in patience .
As a good fortune the day had to be important .
In the morning from Guruji a boat entered us till the airport waterfall .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around the runway .
Later in the evening when Guruji had come out of Maldives then we immediately recognized the C Blain coming out of the top .
We were watching such maps of him .
But then there was no doubt because the next day there is a chance to pay attention to it .
We were going to Rangali Island at a distance of 500 kilometres from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
From C Blain flying till a height of about 1000 metres the hundreds of resorts spread in the sea of Maldives and Goral Islands cannot be forgotten .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is the journey of breathing with thrill and excitement .
But after going to the Hillton Hotels of Gonord Resort on Rangai island we feel like we have come to the world else .
In such a world , there was no contact with any other world outside .
There it was difficult to get out of beauty or luxury life .
Walking in Konarad can be done on foot or can also be reached by a battery car .
When we go from Jetty to the main island then on both the sides of the bridge the beauty of life was wonderful .
Now we were unable to imagine that we were unable to be natural with the nearby nature .
We went to a glass room while descending in the sea several metres below the stairs which was inside the water .
In fact there was a meal and a room .
On all the sides through glasses we could see the magnificent kind of small fish , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting in the decorated tables is thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing this island from Male to sea plane and drinking food below water is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There is no heart to return from there .
We were ready to swim our passport in water .
We know it's not possible.
We returned with the same belief in our mind , then sometimes luck will definitely bring us back to a turn .
For a long time there was a plan to go from Delhi to Wale but because of being busy it did not happen .
Because of the desire of wild animals from the child we thought that this time Jim Corbett should not go .
After picking up till Yegong lake at a little distance from Kardukla in Laddakh in 2006 it remained another biker .
In the morning of 27 December we went out from Delhi to Jim Corbett but the bustle with which we went out , the stoppage reduced our speed .
The journey from Haput to Kajraul was really tired .
Snow from above and bad road in front .
It appeared several times when we were falling .
On one way we reached Karjraula at eight o'clock in the morning .
We came to Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We were in Digu near our resort park , which we had already registered .
Today because of no important event we went to tour the coast of Kosi first after getting cold .
The slopes of the slopes of the slopes of the slopes of the slopes of the slopes of the slopes of the slopes of the slope .
From there we went to roam Ramnagar below .
It took a long time in the evening to return .
On seeing the tiger left in the jungle by deciding from Delhi , I will see a tiger in the dream of the whole night .
In the middle of the deep night I suddenly heard a loud voice , after that the dogs started crying and did not stand for two hours .
Therefore first comes on the Kaladungi and Corbett waterfall road .
In Kaladungi there was a museum of Jim Corbett where some information related to their own life was kept .
The museum of Jim Corbett is in Kaladungi .
It was 12 and a half hours to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come and lived in this village .
On reaching the hotel Safari jipsy was expecting our visit .
He said that he was organised to roam there in Saint Bijrani .
On the one hand when we asked about the number then the tigers come towards the other side to protect the smokey cold .
On reaching Bijrauli we felt a guide , for four hours we bought hundred and fifty rupees for touring .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
There we saw several types of animals and mangles .
Inside we saw two striped elephants which had long teeth .
I took a steady film.
In the middle of this the guide started trekking Phili .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park in which some tigers died in the same year .
At many places we saw their footsteps but I was sorry that I could not see the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was an unexpected deficiency of the tiger .
Then I was reminded of an old friend of Haldwani .
I contacted him on the phone.
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He asked if he had seen the tiger or not .
This word of him was lying like an arrow .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take a bike for the park .
One said that to go inside take a safari .
