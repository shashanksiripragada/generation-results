There was a time when tea gardens were coming here to see .
There are green empire all around .
Once I was confused to see these natural jungles or these tea plants made by humans .
Both are dragging towards themselves .

The snakes are passing through curved and circular ways like going .
The time was spent.
But the jungle and tea gardens are coming .
At some places small settlements are found .
A mountainous house , palace etc . can be seen very thick from a distance .
It was a serpentine .
Staying at one place here we make a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is , by taking a car you can go out roaming around Karsing .
First of all diamond park .
A small garden is surrounded by jungles all around .
To reach from above the train gets down very low .
Though Kursing is full of beauty , there is no fame of development in the tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
The fascination of reaching till the deer park surrounded by the jungles without a hustle-bustle and passing through the trees in the sun shows us a pleasant feeling .
The next place was Ishalkar .
Situated at the next height of this city is a point .
It is called a suite point .
It is said that during the British period the lovers used to live hunting from here .

This journey is very close to Jaipur not only abroad but also outside Rajasthan .
Tourists in itself enjoy one thing in which when the journey attracts towards itself then there is a special place , water ship or a train or a city like rose city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
People are attracted because of some special attraction .
The place I told was built about four and a half years ago , in fact with this structure these places make the wildlife comfortable .
Not only to go there but also to stay there .
In my ears the word of my handicraft Rambabu fish reflects that if we were not able to imagine before this then we stay in the jungle .
50  employees are in this area .
Suddenly the permanent people coming here did not even get employed in the Heritage Hotel .
Rambabu , a resident of Ajabgarh , worked in Jaipur before this and now in this amazing ammon garden .
He gave himself a new form while talking .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of Amman Garden .
There nobody calls themselves in English .
Amman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist place with all the best facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its neighbouring parts .
In the excellent statistics of Rajasthan how many people will roam around the Bangkok of Buddhism , why should they go far away , some of the Jaipurans may have spent the night in this area .
After opening the Ammon garden maximum people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night when Sapna Assam had invited me very interestingly but I could not go .
If they had reached Bangarh by finding their own way then this is a different kind of speciality .
This time suddenly with the invitation of my foreign guests I felt there that these people want to spend a good holiday in less time so that they should definitely go to Amman Garden .
This garden is a different garden conserved in those seven gardens where Alwar king had gone to the hunting place .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .
Its ancient wall is a witness of those days .
Amman Garden surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees hypnotise itself in the first part .
The way you enter inside you are welcomed in the same way , it is said that you can enjoy the extremely peaceful environment here .

We reached Dalhousie in the evening and decided to roam around that garden .

We were attracted by all the palaces and palaces including lighting .
Everything is beautiful .
There is no surprisingness in getting the award for Amman Garden because everything is modern artistic .
Manager gave us our programme for the morning
First of all we walked with Babu and then traveled in jeep for Banghat .
On reaching the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajpagarh in which gradually sunlight was spreading .
On seeing in the dry lake the farmers were cultivating in it .
Because of not raining this year for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
The rural life of John was such a unique experience of environment .
After that we went to Bangtok by jeep .
In the morning I saw Hallandhuvan sitting very carefully on a tourist spot .
Because of these millions of dollars are invaluable moments .
From Amman Garden also Alvita had traditional traditions , giving jaggery and curd and gave us the answer .
Tourists can now know why they spend so much here .
I was told that a tourist group is formed to see the life of the tribals .
Is this right
Certainly this is found in some universe states and tourism has a special interest in it .
This tourism is generally organised for 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists can be taken to different places .
How to eat stay there in this .
In such an explanation attempt is made where there is no excessive development and there is no special reading of nature and people 's lifestyle .
At the same time there are also ancient tourism species .
Besides this attention is also paid to the treatmental guise survey .
In reality such tourist lovers are seen directly in the lifestyle and tradition of that place .
Although it is a little difficult to think but going to such a tourism gives interest and gives a different kind of experience .
Tourists are very enjoyable in the bus .
If you see a crowd here then you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this in this journey you can take too much time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with spending less and giving peace to all the time this journey definitely makes us feel satisfaction .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign destination bus through tourism .
Before getting the ticket get the best deluxe .
Stuttens , military people , children etc . get tickets here , and arrangements are made for both the people .
It is better to buy prescribed travel tickets therefore it is better to arrange tourism by bus in the last train , then make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of the travel plan they should give details about round trip .
Expenditure of morning is also less .
It is very important to take things , therefore listen to things about obesity and weight .
You leave some of your things by the terminal or you fill up the electro products .
Also take the pleasure of insurance or damage from the tourist group .
Take carriage and box conveniently .
Because it can be applied on the rock above the seat .
Keep in mind that during tourism the responsibility of changing things from the bus is yourself .
Wherever you have a bus go to that time only one hour before .
If you are at the time of busy season then keep this thing in the main stage .
Actually as soon as you go , the better seat structure is near you .
Keep in mind the convenience while choosing the seat .
Take the posterior seat too much but there is no convenience to study in the front seat .
If you have to urinate frequently then take a distance skull , if you do not want to make much trouble then the skull near the door will be the best for you .
Now it's a tactical thing.
If you both sit on the seat to sit then first sit on the corner seat and keep your pocket on the other side .
Therefore if there is no crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if there is a bathroom facility in the bus then while selecting the ticket keep in mind that sitting there after some time is difficult .
Introduce bus driver and container .
This way you get enough information .
Everybody goes out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because if it goes away then the busmen do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stand go back to time .
If you do not go on time then you can see some new traveller in your place and you will have to wait for another bus .

Everything is so much that there are two c-blain companies .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Transmall island ' s best in it , near which there is sea plane .
If you want you can roam in an airplane in about 4 , 000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- or the whole plane will be rented for your journey throughout the day .
If you are going to the island of White Ooty from Maldives then it is important to travel in C Blain because it is normal to travel between different islands .
And if you are afraid that this is a journey which will be dangerous then you can not travel in it .
C Blain travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres in Maldives .
We were in the most Antik and Soveniar shops of the capital of the Ahmad Bazar of Maldives .
All the cellsmen are listening to the lectures given by the President Mohammad Nasid of Maldives in the Cauvery Hall a day ago in the world climate .
I am confident that no Indian has heard the speeches of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a challenge in the state of a unique creation of this earth then such a terribleness is very important .
Some people know the magnificent magnificence of those who reach inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives in October because how poor the world becomes .
The beauty there has some speciality like this .
There is no such beautiful tomb in that small country .
After roaming around the market they return towards the jetty to go back to their guruj , then surely while paying attention to the road there is a dinner of sea water because the people here know this beautiful amazing boundary .
Below the light of Lamp Pongt fishes swimming in a few metres deep are showing their colors .
This is a sea shore which is attached to the city .
If you are able to see some centimetres clean in the river or sea water connected with any city of India then you will be able to enjoy yourself .
Returning to M . . Akwamerin in Maldives roaming around in the world for two hours in the evening .
Corol Rifle is a life here .
Till now you will get the rocks and silver silver silver silver silver silver silver .
In order to listen to the speeches of President Nashi we were standing outside in some government pit later .
We stayed before the chief residence of one country 's best office and had no security for a long time because it was unable to believe .
We were taking photographs at a distance of about 50 metres on the gardens and rocks along with the hand being extended inside his terrible gate .
Can you imagine this by bringing some ordinary head to the house of India
It is said that while crossing the roads the President had always come to his office two blocks ahead .
In the matter of Maldives every thing has to be defeated .
That is why I had the hope of patience the next day .
As a good basil that day had to be important .
In the morning a boat entered us from Guruji till airport Jalland .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around the Runway .
Later in the evening when Guruji was coming out of the Maldives then we immediately identified C . Blain .
We were watching so many maps of him .
But then there was no doubt because the next day there was a chance of paying attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali island at a distance of 500 kilometres from the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of Rishand and Coral Islands spread over the sea of Maldives from cy Blain flying till about 1000 metres high .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is a journey that stops breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But as soon as we reach Hilton Hotels Chin Konrat Resort in Rangai Island it feels like we have come to the world somewhere else .
In such a world , there was no contact with any other world outside .
It was difficult to get out the beauty or delicate life there .
One can go on walking in Konrat or can go on a car running with a pattern .
On going from jetty to main island on both sides of the bridge there was a marvellous glimpse of life .
Now we have come to imaginable imagination with the nature nearby .
We reached a glass room while descending several metres below the sea water through the stairs which was inside the water .
That half was actually a meal and a room .
On all the sides through glasses we could see a unique kind of small and big fish , corals , snorkelling and scooba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables of the architecture is thrilling in itself .
The fare for seeing this island by sea plane from Malayalam and drinking food under water is 47 thousand rupees per hall .
One does not feel like returning from there .
We were ready to swallow our passport in water .
We know it's not possible.
We returned with the same belief in mind , then sometimes luck in one turn would definitely bring us .
For a long time we were planning a plan to go to Delhi from Delhi but this was not happening because of the work being done .
Why did we think that we should not go to Jim Corbett this time because of the desire of wild animals from the child .
After boating in Ladakh at a distance of some distance from Kardugla and Yagong lake in 2006 this was a second bike .
In the morning of 27 December we departed from Delhi to Jim Corbett , but the speed with which we moved out the clothing reduced our speed .
The journey between Hapur to Khajraula was really tired .
Snow from above and bad roads ahead .
It appeared several times that when it was falling .
We reached Karjraula by one way at eight in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We were in Digha near our resort park , before that we had registered .
Because of no important event today we first went to roam on the banks of Kosi after getting cold .
After two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below days .
It was a long time in the evening to return .
We went out by deciding from Delhi that if we see the wounds of the tiger released in the jungle then I will see a tiger in a dream all night .
I heard a loud voice suddenly in the midnight and after that dogs did not stand for two hours starting swinging .
Therefore first comes on the way to Kaladungi and Corbett waterfalls .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladungi where some information related to personal life was kept .
Jim Corbett Museum at Kaladungi
It was about two and a half hours to return .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
On reaching the hotel the safari jeepsy was waiting for our visit .
He said that he was organised to roam in one of the sites of Bijrani there .
When we were asking about one trust then the tigers come towards that side to save the cold .
On reaching Bijarauli we got a guide , for four hours we bought hundred and fifty rupees for roaming .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and manglasses there .
Inside we saw two teethed elephants , which had long teeth .
I picked up a standing film .
In the middle of this the guide started trekking Philippe .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park in which some tigers died in one year .
At many places we saw their footprints , but I am sorry that they could not see the tiger .
On the third day we have to go back to Delhi .
In my mind the sight of the tiger was running .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Halduvani .
I contacted him on the phone.
I told him that I have come to Corbett.
He asked if he had seen the tiger or not .
His word was like a bamboo .
I'm not slow.
There is no permission to carry a bike to the park .
One said that to go inside take a ride .
