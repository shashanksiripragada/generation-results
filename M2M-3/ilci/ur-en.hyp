His language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it's different .
On one side of some there is a mixture of both in Sind and on the other side in Gujarat therefore in language .
It is called ' Kuchi ' .
Although this is ' Building ' , it does not have its own routine .
If you have to write Kuchi then you have to write in Gujarati tradition .
Near Bhoj itself is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same road then we will have to take a holiday of the whole month and open schools in Mumbai .
Do you do then  Now you will travel in the train by calling the fast buses of Gujarat to Tata .
From Bhoj the small train of meter gauge will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and the big train of Broad gauge will reach Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry considered to be the main foundation of the destruction of Rajasthan is passing through both these bad times .
Due to the increasing threats of world depression and South Asia the business of tourism has been deeply pushed .
From the point of view of tourism a lot of deficiency has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country .
The latest data released recently by the Rajasthan government tells that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has come down more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . percent in the number of foreign tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included while during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 25558691 country and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the field of tourism are very worried about this situation .
The director of Rajputana Holida Meccerus Sanjay Koshik says that the accidents of world temple and magnificence have badly affected the business of tourism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare the strong basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . percent in comparison to the last year .
21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan from foreign tourists coming to India .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
Due to the point of view of tourism the present year has become excellent for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing has been new .
Desert , havelis , forts , buffaloes , jungles , everything is the same old for attracting tourists .
In the field of tourism the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism , all the governments increase but what has not been done on this side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in recent years in Rajasthan the reports of Jinnah and Kazhad have also made the importance of this state spotted at the international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it remained confined to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Promotion Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of encouraging tourism in Rajasthan and promoting the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides the facilities of setting up , food , movement , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one movement unit and two Train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation is also thin for many years .
In 2008 - 2009 the ghat of RTDC was 185 lac , which is expected to be 632 lac in 2010 - 2009 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also reaching it a big ghat .
Among these there are special Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists did not become attractive towards this rail .
Despite reducing the fare it did not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a lack of interest in the Pushkar fair as well .
In the year 2007 to 2008 in the tourist villages built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed there this year this number decreased to 217 .
There is no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Raji train for RTDC amidst all this .
This train is continuously reaching benefits .
Last year RTDC was benefitted from this train for nine and a half crores .
The lines of concern in the field of tourism coming in the field of tourism in Rajasthan are natural to be seen .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If the person wants to do something in his heart then he can make him sleep with soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it true by establishing modern city Ambu Valley in the Sahadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had dreamed , seeing the body developing day by day he reflects happiness in his eyes .
His happiness was also visible during the inauguration of the Nazi Airport of Ambu Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a great city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres only 9 percent hotels , houses and other facilities have been made on the ground .
On 19 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city built for crores of leaves and today approximately 800 families are living in this city .
Initially , industrialists and rices bought their shelter here in the form of Hollyday Home but now they have made it their first house and used to come to Mumbai for work from here .

Behind the name of this idol and place the residents here are famous many charming stories and old stories .
The ruins of the palaces of Devalpani are still singing the pride of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamrieshwari Devi obtained in these remains is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient stories there is a mention of the greatness of Tameshwari Devi .
During the time of Chaitya kings there was acceptance of this goddess in the mountains of the north and south .
The tribes here used to worship the goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans was also given due to which Raja Gorinath Singh had stopped later .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohat district of Arunachal .
They are called the ruins of Bhishmaknagar which are located in the terrain between the Debang and Dibang rivers here .
According to the prevailing stories here this place is ancient Vadarbha , where King Bhashmak used to rule at one time .

We reach Jero from four hours through jeep from the city of Upper Assam Noorth Likimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Loor Subansari district .
At a height of approximately 4,500 feet this charming mountainous place enjoys the heart of the people coming .
This is the same charming place where you live .
It used to take several days to reach here before the way to the jeep .
On reaching here trees of high deodar , beautiful pyramrose , wallet , wild crant , strawberries and rusberries enjoy the views of the people coming .
Apple and cardamom are produced here very much .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kms .
This beautiful valley is the residence of Apatani people .
With its hard work people have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice farming here .
This place is a store of rice .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of its talent of hard work and farming .
The requirement of its water pool gets fulfilled by Kali river .
The trees of Pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on a slight redness emerging in the sky at the peak in the middle of the mountain ranges covered with snow of the left hand .
There is good coldness in the air .
Along with cooling cool in the air there is also a feeling of moisture .
Below the feet the layer of the palm on the wooden floor is seen from the sound of the waste .
There is moisture in the air and due to the bright shadow of the sun before sunrise nothing is visible more .
The eyes remain on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on the bench lying in Balkani .
On applying the hand the smooth layer of the palle gets stuck with the sound of a slight church and the hand gets separated from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of living in this small village in the middle of these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third place in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent Geneva or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both sides of the thin sandal river is spread very above the slopes .
This main river of Switzerland is the valley of Hone on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The contiguous road of the Run river and the ringing vehicles on it have begun to be seen clearly .
The journey of 300 kilometres away and half an hour from car then along with the balance of Geneva lake and half Run river the Geneva lake coming from the eastern direction near the city named Montru which is called Laklima in French .
300 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake .
From there the lake goes forward towards the west after forming a river .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
Crossing from a beautiful city named Leok -LRB- euk -RRB- we leave this highway on the left side , we come on the hilly road towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun is giving full sunlight to the whole corner of the evening .
In comparison to the valley the amount of snow is less here , almost not equal .
As the height moves towards , the amount of snow starts increasing .
Despite being frozen good snow on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
Certainly on this roaming hilly road the journey of about 20 kilometres reaches a small village named Thil -LRB- Hel -RRB- in half an hour .
Chalet -LRB- chalet -RRB- - with slopy roofs , large storeys made of wood completely .
In the basement made of the cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of vehicles .
Village is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine -LRB- wine -RRB- is the main center of making grapes alcohol .
The cultivation of grapes takes place on 37 landscapes of the entire canton .
The gardens of grapes in the villages settled on both the sides of the Run Valley provide a unique jewellery to the beauty there .
To take the gardens of grapes -LRB- Winnerds -RRB- , to make them roam around in the villages there at night and to take alcohol in the dry wine factory -LRB- Wineesting -RRB- is an incomplete part of the tourism bupar here .
In a small town named Age -LRB- Aigle -RRB- there is a very big museum of Angori liquor in a 12th century -LRB- Chateau -RRB- , to see which foreign tourists have to make booking first .
Once again we pass through the middle of this jungle from Davanal .
The way up to three - four kilometres the mind gets worse even more than the questions of the children .
Suddenly on a turn a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing -LRB- skiing -RRB- in the snow on the flat slope from the upper of the village .
The dense jungle of Deodar is spread from slope to upper mountain peak .
Ghanghar snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining because of the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach Us village .
Here also the same rumour has been shadowed .
From all around the peak of the mountain till the valley is the rule of dust snow .
In the next five minutes in the middle of this town we reach a big round square .
The name of the town is Leukarbad -LRB- Deukerbad -RRB- .
Located at a height of 4,500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukarbad is about 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here , sportspersons and therapists can be estimated from this point that for the stay of 1700 apartments and Shelle Chalets of 6900 beds there are 28 hotels , camping sites of tobacco , patients of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .

On reaching the village one feels full warmth .
In the scorching sun the thick spot of snow above the roof of the houses is shining .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albanian village is one of the safe places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
In Darjeeling itself it was told that the taxis of Saraf Sikkim can be done in Sikkim therefore checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the state is the second , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are the same , the circumambulation air are the same .
The supportive moisture on the whole body is the same .
During the rainy season Surmai is the same .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was pucca , the first decision was taken to take a glimpse of Kurseong .
Kurseong is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , filled with sunlight jungle .
Famous for the production of high tea .
While moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , in the beginning itself the tea gardens of Muscrahat welcome the people moving towards themselves .
Crossing through the road amidst tea gardens enjoy heart in the first time itself .
On one side green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side deep green valley .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
On the four sides there was the reign of greenery .
Once again I was hungry , look at these natural jungles or plants of tea planted by man .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The more beautiful jungle was the tea gardens spread till far .
If you look at the roads of the roads then it looks unique .
The move of the snake was moving curved and narrow road .
The time was also passing .
If it was not passing , then the gardens of forest and tea .
Sometimes small towns are seen .
From a distance itself a hill house - house etc . appeared very dense .
It was Christiang .
After staying here at a place we made a program of touring the whole day .
After taking a car we got out on a tour of Kurseong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden surrounded by huge jungles .
Upper was climbing i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being fascinated with the beauty of Kurseong even now developed as a tourist spot has not been found famous .
Although the city is quite high and clean .
Despite being desperate the way was giving us the pleasure of climbing the way between the greed and sunlight trees to reach the deer park surrounded by forests .
The next place was Aggle Craig .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Swed Point .
It is said that in the times of the British lovers used to die from here .
At present , this is decorated with a park and restaurant .
There is a stair like dome here , on seeing the whole of the city from the height of which a beautiful sight comes out .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy in breaking the tea leaf running hands with a lot of speed on the back .
There is a museum outside Kurseong city , but on that day we could not go there , because roaming around the charming air of tea gardens felt more necessary .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a charming experience in itself , but there was a lot of concern that if it was raining then how would we roam .
But anxiety was very high that after reaching the park we roamed around enjoying the sporting sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The road to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little and below from here Gheera got Gangmaya from the mountains .
Here amidst rocks the magnificence of waterfalls is worth seeing .
In the rock garden we found that there are waterfalls in the reign of rocks and rocks then the confluence of waterfalls in Gangmaya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are located very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batsia Lope in Darjeeling after climbing up with the help of the vehicle .
The whole mountain and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durbin from here .
The nature of the weather was straight till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , from where the crack came and started shining .
In the evening the program of roaming and shopping on the Mal Road was made .
In the tour of Darjeeling Toy Trains put Charchand in the journey .
The tour of Darjeeling from Darjeeling to Gum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
There is a little rest in boating and garden in the Merk lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where sweaters made of hand of Nepalese artisans etc . are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Although Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district but its form is different .
Here not the greenery of tea gardens , but the arrival of forests and waterfalls is going .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which is filled with waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shade of winter , on roaming around Darjeeling , the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling had tied me with ourselves .
My recent journey was very interesting and surprising .
This journey was not of non-state nor of outside Rajasthan but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself , in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like Gulab Nagar or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people come dragging .
The place where you are going to talk about , it is just about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation which this place has come there , it has actually made it in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for the people living there .
In my ears my guide echoes the words of Rambabumina , so before this we could not even think that we can stay in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this very area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get any work in the heritage hotel .
Rambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in the Shanti Bagh with this unique royal style .
He has slopped himself in a new color to speak .
Peace garden is the style of peace garden .
There nobody calls you English by speaking .
Peace in Shanti Bagh is a tourist place with peaceful China and all the conveniences .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it makes you know from the surrounding area .
How many of the people who spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have roamed Bhangad of Bhoots  Why did they go away , some of the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of Shanti Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as well when Prime Minister Shabana had called me from the heart there but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he himself had reached Mangadh by wandering the way .
This time suddenly on the invitation of my foreign guests I reached there , it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Shanti Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from these seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteenth century .
Its old wall is a witness of those days .
The first glimpse of Shanti Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees attracts you .
As soon as you come inside the way in which you are welcomed , it feels that a lot of attention has been paid here on spiritual peace .
Along with tying the root in Kalai the mantra of Mangalachar is done alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we decided to set up a cycle of this garden .
My guest Jaiki who has been a decorative expert , suddenly speaking this is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are affected .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic  No wonder that Shanti Bagh has got prizes recently .
The manager decided our program in the morning .
First of all walking along with Rambabu and then the journey of the jeep of Bhangadh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Kazirgarh on which gradually the light of the sun was spreading .
Seeing the dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time the cultivation of tobacco was seen .
For J . . such a glimpse of the life of the village was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangad from Jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable bridge of millions of dollars .
The way to say the departure of Shanti Bagh is also conventional Thagad and curd they gave us a discount .
Now it came to understand why tourists come here to spend so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show Tribal Life .
Is this right
There is no such thing in many states and tourists also show special interest in them .
These tours are generally prepared for two weeks from four days and during this tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying there , food etc are also included .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places , where there has not been much development and where the lifestyle of nature and people has not had a special effect on time .
Also where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this attention is also given only on doing triditional cosine .
Actually the purpose of such a tour has to be done to the tourists with the way of living and tradition of this place .
Although it feels a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
Despite being with a lot of people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to distribute your favorite book .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with giving a lot of less expensive and peaceful time these tours definitely enjoy courage from you .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching through a foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking ticket search for best deal .
Students , senior people of military , children , etc . get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of discount for two people also .
However , buying tickets in Advanced is cheap , hence it is better to plan bus tour in the last bridge that planning should be done a little before .
Instead of two-way ticket know about round trips .
It is comfortable .
Laws taking bags are very hard , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
Somewhere it should not be such that you have to leave some goods on terminal or have to pay a different fee .
Also know the law of insurance or compensation from tour company .
Kerry on bags remain right , go with it .
Because these seats come in the rake above .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From where you have to take the bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the consolidated season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
While selecting the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If there will be more shaking on the last seat , then there will be no comfort on the seats ahead .
If you have to go again and again , then take a seat with the corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed , then the seat with the window will be better for you .
Now the matter of a walking .
If you are in the forefront of both the palms , then first sit on the seat with the corner and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is convenience of vasrom in the bus , then while preferring the seat also keep in mind this thing , because sitting there after a little while it becomes difficult .
Make identification from bus driver and contractor .
This way you will get enough important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the buses do not take its responsibility .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can get a new traveller at your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome is not seen in Europe then nothing has been seen .
The capital of Italy is a famous city of Rome ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy is from Rome , those old cities of the world from where civilizations have been developed .
This is the reason that its impression appears on Western swelling .

In Kalosim , the gladator i . . Tagore Baz used to show his craze .
They used to compete not only among themselves , but also with wild animals .
These fights that give heart shields , be it from other sides or animals , till then one of the fighters could not die .
There used to be a lot of forums in ancient rooms .
Let's say that places of burning sensation to be found are called forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political activities of the city used to happen .
Among these the most famous forum was Romanum and the remains of royal palaces , temples and pillars are present at this place even today .
Seeing them the magnificence of ancient Rome becomes very good .
Pethan : This unique ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
In the middle of its huge dome is an open place of 30 feet .
Due to this place devotees felt as if their prayers are directly reaching the gods .
Inside the temple all around the idols of goddesses are made .
Although this temple was built in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Villaborgas is unparalleled .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to the room .
Definitely go to the museum built here , because on touching it you will lose the opportunity to be rubbed with the best art .
The idols made here are incomparable and so many animals feel as if they will speak now .
Here Napolenaol 's sister Polion , whose marriage took place in the Borge royal family , a idol lying on the palanquin looks so alive that you will not be able to see it one piece .
The main attraction of Rome is in its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here , in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trive Fountain ' .
It is believed that if somebody wants to come back in the room , then it should be put in the fountain with this wish together .
It is believed that by doing this this desire is definitely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be completed until you see ' Vetkan City ' .
From the sixth century this place has been the residence of the most religious viewers of Roman Catholic religion , Pope ' .

Look at the famous Saint Peter Church , Saint Peter Square , Fountains , Museums etc . of Vetkan City .
Undoubtedly these will show you a different view of the world and you will always be able to remember .

At some time the palace of Peshwa rulers staying here is incomplete without seeing the famous Ushva Ashram of Shanivarawada and Lord Jerusalem .
There are two hotels of Janjar in Pune , Jopmpari and Vikad .
In the middle of Pumpri industrial area and at the place named Vikad situated on Pune - Bangalore highway all the Dunu hotels of jungles are lassed with modern facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra is laden with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports , which is like a heaven for tourists where a very good view of the glory of ancient times from the tour of ancient church houses is found .
Located in Panji the capital of Goa , Janjar Hotel makes this journey of western coast very excellent .

If you see in today 's history then for Maldives the cheapest for Delhi is the rent of 28 thousand rupees per person .
After this if you stay in Male then you can get hotels in some less rent but enjoying the real beauty of Maldives go to some island nearby then the pocket will be small .
Cechrose proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Cross started the solitary sequence of India for Maldives and Colombo from Kochi .
Louis Cross is the European company and is a very named village in Cross and Hotel Beopar .
Although due to some problems Louis Cross has now closed its services , but it is expected to start their pattern from October .
You can go to Maldives for three days cruise at the cost of at least 5850 rupees per person per night at the ship of Loe Cross Aquarian .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then children of less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else should be done .
Tea , breakfast , food are included in the fare of cruise .
The entertainment of every time together .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket .
While roaming around in big airplanes suddenly a sepline stands in front of you then you will start to open .
But with 12 - 15 seats this is excellent for roaming around Archie Pelgo -LRB- Majjid zear -RRB- like Tunotriplean Maldives .
On the surface of water running like a speed boat when it gets up in the air , it does not know .
In Puri flight you do not have the estimation of ordinary flights .
Every time your windows keep shining with windows - blue water of different sheds of Maldives watching the resort islands and Koral islands .
Everything looks clear .
There are only two Sepline companies in Maldives .
Trans-Maldevian is one of them which has 20 seplene .
If you want then you can roam around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or you can take the whole seaplane for the entertainment of your whole day -LRB- the pocket is deep -RRB- .
Although if you go to some island away from Male Island then the journey of the tourists will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which the heart of ending may never do to you .
From 12 kms to 183 kms -LRB- best in Maveli Varu -RRB- journey is done in the islands of Maldives .
In the Ahmadi market of Male we were in the biggest Antic and Shownier shop of the capital .
One day before by the President Mohammad Nasheed of the entire Cellsman Maldives the speech given in the Copenhagen was listening very carefully to him .
Saying honestly I did not see any Indian listening to the speech of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land , then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the sitting inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but it seems going to Maldives that if the natural calamity takes it from us then how poor the world will be .
Such is something special in the beauty there .
In this small country such beauty does not absorb .
To go back to his cruise back from this tour of the market , when the eyes suddenly went into the water of the sea walking along the road then it felt as if the price of this beauty of the people here is as much as possible .
The water was so clear that swimming fishes in several metres deep below the light of the lampost were visible with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see some centimetres in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will be able to find yourself lucky .
Two hours of the evening spent in Male while returning to Emview Marine were roaming around in mind .
Coral reflection -LRB- Monga Chatons -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones laid on the sepulchres of here you will get fountains .
We were standing outside their official residence for some time before listening to the speech of President Nashad .
It was not sure that we were not a security worker far ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country .
With joy we were pulling the gardens and exports only 50 metres away by raising hands inside the gate of its bunglow .
Can you think about the house of any advanced leader of India
It was also known that the president sometimes crossed the road on foot and reached his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about Maldives was thrilling .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
Allahabad was that it was going to be a special day .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives while cutting the cycle of the runway .
Last evening when Cross Male was reaching near then we immediately recognized the syphilians passing through above .
Such pictures which had been seen , of it .
But then there was no disappearance that the next day it would get an opportunity to ride .
We were going to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the seaplane of Transmal Deven .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and Koral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from Sepline flying till a height of approximately one thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with romantic and passion .
But on reaching the Konra Desert of Halton Hotels on Rangali Island it seemed as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no idea from any world outside .
Therefore it was not like this that it was difficult to get out of the beauty of the beauty there .
Walking on Konarad can also be done on foot or from a car running from the battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was unique .
Till now we could not even bear ourselves with the nature of the surroundings , that such a place had reached , was unbearable .
While descending several metres below the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a glass room which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Crossing all around we could see magnificent kinds of small fish , corals , snowworming and scuba diving humans .
The idea of eating sitting on decorated tables there was very surprising in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Sepline the rent for seeing it and underwater lunch is 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no mind to return from there .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But they knew , it was not possible .
With heavy mind we returned with this hope that sometimes , sometimes we will definitely come here .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood there was a fond of wildlife then why should not imagine why not go to jam corbett this time .
In 2006 ahead of Khardungla near Laddakh this was the second bicycle tour after bicking till Tagang lake .
On the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the excitement which came out of jealousy , the fog dragged our speed .
The journey between Hapad and Gajraula was really tired .
From Upper to Kora and in front of the bad road .
Many times it felt that now it fell .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort park was in Dhakli , whose booking we had done before .
This day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to roam at the edge of Kosi first .
After spending two - three hours there we went out of the Corbett Museum , which was just near Dhangadi Gate 2 kilometres away from difficult .
From there we went to roam Ramnagar below .
Returning late evening .
From Delhi it had come out that if the tiger roaming open in the jungle will definitely see then the whole night keep watching me lions in dreams .
In the midst of the depths of the night suddenly gave me a loud voice and after that the dogs who started roasting started then they did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first advice came to visit Kaladhangi and Corbett Fall .
Kaladhangi is 30 kilometres away , while it falls on the Corbett Fall road .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to their life have been kept .
On returning we went to 12 and a half o'clock .
Kaladhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that he has made an arrangement of sighting in one site Bajrani there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and tigers come towards it to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bajrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees to roam around four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we had two tissues of elephants , whose long teeth were .
I did jamkar photography .
This beach guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but there was an instance in not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a fountain ride of Tiger .
That is why I remembered my old friend of Haldwani .
I put such a phone .
I told him that I had come to carbohydrate .
He did not see the tiger asked .
These words of this were engraved like a shrine .
I said gradually , no .
In the park there was no permission to take bakery in the park .
Someone advised us to take the safari inside.
