Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of some there is a mixture of both in Sindhu and on the other side in Gujarat .
It is called ' kchi ' .
Although this is ' bolly ' , it does not have its own scripture .
If you have to write something then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhoj itself is that Anjaar city where several times earthquake has occurred and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toural .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same route by which we had come then we will have to take a holiday of one month and school will be opened here in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now you will travel in the train by calling the fast buses of Gujarat tota .
The small train of meter gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhoj .
From there one small train of meter gauge and one small train will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main foundation of the mausoleum of Rajasthan is passing through these two sides .
Due to the increasing threats of world recession and South Asia the profession of tourism has been deepened .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be counted among the major states of the country has been recorded in these days .
The latest data released recently by the Rajasthan government tells that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has come down by more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of foreign tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included while during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 25558691 national and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are specially worried about this situation .
Sanjay Koshik , the director of Rajputana Holade Makers , says that the incidents of world republic and civilization have badly affected the profession of tourism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare a strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism the present year has become excellent for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
Nothing new is happening from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , havelis , forts , buffaloes , jungles , everything is the same old for attracting tourists .
If we talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism in the field of tourism then all the governments increase but nothing has been done on that side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very little .
At the same time in the recent years in Rajasthan along with foreign and foreign tourists the warriors of Jana and Kazirchhar have also stained the importance of this state internationally .
Years ago the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it remained accumulated only till papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of promoting tourism and developing the basic structure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides the facilities of stay , comfort , transportation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one movement unit and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
In 2008 - 2009 the ghat of RTDC remained 185 lakhs , of which in 2009 - 2010 it is expected to be 632 lakhs .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also reaching it a big ghat .
Among these are the main Royal Rajasthan of Wildlife .
Tourists could not become attractive towards this train .
Despite reducing the rent it could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the tourist villages built by RTDC in this fair from 2007 to 2008 where 398 foreign tourists stayed , this year this number decreased to 217 .
It is worth patience for RTDC in the middle of all that there has been no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This train is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
It is natural to see the worries of concern in the field of tourism from this ground in the tourism sector of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his heart then he can make a sleep with soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it to be true by establishing modern city Ambu Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had seen , seeing the body developing every day joy reflects in his eyes .

The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place in the form of an excellent city .
In this city spread over 10 , 000 acres only 9 percent land hotels , houses and other facilities have been built .

This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of Apataani .
With its hard work people have made it their heaven .
Rice farming is abundant here .
This place is a rice store .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of their hard work and the excellence of farming .
The necessity of its irrigation is fulfilled by the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on light redness emerging in the sky at the peak in the middle of the mountain ranges covered with snow of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the chilling cold in the air there is also feeling of moisture .
Below the feet with the sound of garbage the layer of skin scattered on the wooden floor is seen .
There is moisture in the air and because of the blurred shadow of before sunrise nothing is visible .
Eyes remain placed on the redness of the East .
One feels like sitting on a bench lying in balcony .
On applying hands the smooth layer of palanquin gets struck with the sound of a light cruise and hands get separated from the shock with the feeling of coldness .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending night in this small village settled amidst the snow laden mountains of Switzerland .
This is my third residence in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent Geneva or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the river eating thin slopes is spread very high on light slopes .
This is the valley of the main river of Switzerland -LRB- Honey -RRB- on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The contemporary road of the Ron river and the ringing cars on it have started to be seen clearly .
The journey of half an hour from a distance of 300 kilometres and half an hour from a car is found in the Geneva lake which is called Laklima in French -LRB- Laklima -RRB- near the city named Rondi Montru coming from the eastern direction along with the convenience of Geneva lake and half Ron river .
Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 300 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves ahead towards the west .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- across the lake .
Crossing the city from a beautiful desert named Leok from the left side we leave this highway , come on the mountainous road towards the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun of the evening is giving full sunlight to the whole corner .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here , almost not equal .
As they move towards height , the quantity of snow starts increasing .
Despite good special snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clear sky and shining sun .
On this roaming mountainous road we reach the village with a small name of the plate after traveling about 20 kilometres in half an hour .
Shile -LRB- chalet -RRB- - There are many storey bungalows with slopy roofs , made of wood completely .
In the basement made of the cement contract of this bungalow there are rooms for controlling the necessary services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of vehicles .
Vilai is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine -LRB- wine -RRB- is the main center of making grape alcohol .
There is a cultivation of grapes on 37  ground part of the whole cantonment .
In the village settled on both the sides of the Roon valley the gardens of grapes provide a unique place to the beauty there .
Take up to the gardens of grape -LRB- paneards -RRB- , getting their roaming done at night in the village there and taking them to the factory of grape wine -LRB- niesting -RRB- is an incomplete part of the tourist buopar here .
In a small town named Agle there is a very big museum of Angori wine in a twelfth century built in a small town , to see which foreign tourists have to book first .
Once again we pass through the middle of the jungle of Usi , passing from Davanal to Bhasma .
The mind gets even more deteriorated by the humble questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kilometres .
Suddenly on a turn a dramatic and charming change comes from the view .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley towards the left side of the road there is a beautiful group of houses settled .
People are skiing -LRB- skiing -RRB- in the snow on a flat slope from above the village .
From skiing slope till the peak of the upper mountain the dense forest of Deodar is spread .
Ghangwar snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining because of the direct rays of sun .
In five minutes we reach Us village .
Here also the same symptom is covered .
There is a rule of dust snow from the peak of the mountain to the valley all around .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round chakra in the middle of this town .
The name of the town is Luckerabad -LRB- Ukerbad -RRB- .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Leokerabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and therapists coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments of 6900 beds and Shelle Childs -LRB- 1500 -RRB- for staying 28 hotels , camping sites of copper , 90 bed patients and 50 restaurants here .

Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one among the conserved places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling only that in Sikkim only taxis can be taken , therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is the second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the air is the same .
The moisture of the whole body is the same .
Suramai is the same in the rainy season .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was finished , the first decision was to take the sight of Kurseang .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Filled with tea gardens , filled with the jungle of sunshine .
Famous for production of high tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning only tea gardens welcome the people moving towards themselves .
Passing through the road in the middle of tea gardens hypnotise the heart for the first time .
On one side the green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side deep green ditch .
Sometimes the jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
There was a rule of greenery all around .
Together I went to Harbara , seeing these natural jungles or tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful forest was , the more beautiful the tea gardens spread till far .
If you see on the roads of the road then it looks unique .
The movement of snakes was going crooked and narrow paths .
The time was also passing .
If we were not passing then forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns appear .
From a distance a hilly house - house etc . was seen to be very dense .
This was Curseyang .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming all day .
We got out on a tour of Curseang taking a car .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
Upper was climbing i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being enthusiastic with the beauty of Kursyang has not yet become famous as a tourist place .
Although the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being sunset the greed of reaching till the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the path between the trees of sunshine was providing us compassion .
The next place was Eggle Crig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called soside point .
It is said that in the time of the British lovers used to live by hiding from here .
At present , this is decorated with a park and restaurant .
There is a stair like dome here , at a height of which a beautiful view of the whole city comes forward .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking tea leaf running hands with great speed .
There is a museum outside Kurseang city , but that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to tour the pleasant environment of tea gardens .
Next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a charming experience in itself , but it was a big concern that if there was such rains then how would we roam around
But it was very interesting that after reaching the Rock Garden we roaming around enjoying the sports sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more attractive than this .
On moving a little more down from here we met Ghera Gangamaya from the hills .
Here amidst rocks the mai of the waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that there are waterfalls in the reign of leafying and rocks then in Gangamaya the synonymous world of waterfalls is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are located very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw the Botsia Loop in Darjeeling climbing up with the help of the vehicle .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durbin .
The nature of the weather was steady till now .
But yes , we moved towards the monastery , decreasing from where the cracks came and started swinging .
In the evening a program of walking on mall road and shopping was made .
In the tour of Darjeeling the toy trains put a charchand in the journey .
The journey of tour from Darjeeling to Dhoom to Darjeeling is special attraction for the tourists .
Here a little rest in boating and garden in Merik lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this route , where sweaters made of hand of Nepalese artisans etc are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Although Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its form is different .
Here not the greenery of tea gardens , but the arrival of forests and waterfalls is going on .
The most popular tourist place of Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which is filled with forest waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Calcutta to roam Darjeeling in the shadow of winters , on seeing Darjeeling here the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with ourselves .
My recent small journey was very interesting and surprising .
This journey was not of non-country nor of Rajasthan , but of very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting topic in itself , in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or any city like Gulabi Nagar or the lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to draw .
The place where I am going to talk is just prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation with which this place has come there it has truly engraved it in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there , but also for those who stay there .
In my ears my guide echoes the words of Rambabumina , so before that we could not even think that we could stay like this in the jungle .
50 Persian Staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not even get work in the Heritage Hotel .
Rambabu residents of Hazirgarh used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this unique royal style of Shanti Bagh .
He has put the walking of his own words into a new color .
The belief is the style of Shanti Bagh .
There no one calls you English speaking .
Shantibagh is a tourist place with peace , peace and all the conveniences .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you from the surrounding area .
How many of the people who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have traveled to Bhanggarh of Bhotas why did they go away , even some of the people of Jaipur would have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of Shantibagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I also remember that night when the Prime Minister had called me there with heart but I could not go .
It is a different matter that they had reached Mangadh by roaming their own way .
This time suddenly I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a magnificent holiday in less time they should definitely go to Shanti Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from these seven gardens where the king of Alor used to stay for hunting .
Its construction was done in sixteen hundred .
Its old wall is a witness to these days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Shanti Bagh attracts you .
As soon as you come inside the way you are welcomed , it feels that a lot of attention has been given here on spiritual peace .
Along with binding Muli in Kalai the life of Mangalachar mantra is done .
We had reached in the evening and we decided to apply a cycle to this garden .
My host Jayki , who has been a decorative expert , suddenly spoken , is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are impressed .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but art  No one wondered that Shanti Bagh has also got the award recently .
The manager decided our program for taking place in the morning .
First of all walking with Rambabu and then the jeep journey of Bhanggarh .
While walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Hazirgarh on which the sunlight was gradually spreading .
Seeing the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
For Jaiki such a glimpse of the life of the village was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhanggarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is the priceless bridge of millions of dollars .
The way to say goodbye to Shantibagh also by opening the traditional thread and curd he gave us a way .
Now I came to understand why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show travel life .
Is this right
There is no such thing in many states and tourists also show special interest in them .
These tours are generally prepared for two weeks from four days and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places where there has not been much development and there has not been any special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides this attention is given only on doing traditional cosine .
Actually the purpose of such a tour has to be done by tourists with the lifestyle and traditions of this place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
With this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time making your favorite book distributed .
Yes , it is of course so much that along with giving less expensive and peaceful enough time these tours definitely ask you for patience .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is important to take care of some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination bus through tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc . get a discount on them , then for two people also the arrears of discount remain .
However , buying tickets in advance is cheap , therefore it is better to plan bus tours in the last bridges that plan a little ahead .
Instead of a two-way ticket know about round trip .
It becomes lethargic .
The laws regarding the baggage are very hard , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There should be no such thing that you have to leave some of your things on the terminal or have to pay a different fee .
Also know the law of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
Kerry on bags are right , walk on taking them .
Because they get cured in the rake above the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus during tour the responsibility of the goods will be yours .
Where you have to take the bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the busy season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat choice will be with you .
While selecting the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If you will feel more shocks on the last seat then you will not stay comfortable on the front seat .
If you have to go again and again , then take a corner set and if you do not like to be more troubled then the window seat will be better for you .
Now the matter of a trick .
If you are in the forefront of both the palms then first sit on a corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is a comfort of washram in the bus , then keep in mind that while preferring the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make the identity of just dryer and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stays , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then in your place a new traveller can get and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

Famous philosopher Michael Engelo had built the stairs of climbing on it in 1536 .
In front of Captoline is the idol of Sultan Marx riding on horse and brass of Yales , who had ruled Rome till 160 - 180 AD .

These wars that give heart attacks , whether it is from other tablets or from animals , continued till the time one of the fighters died .
There were many platforms in ancient Rome .
Let us tell you that the place of burning to meet is called a forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political etc activities of the city used to happen .
Among these the most famous forum was Romanum and the ruins of royal palace , temples and pillars are present even today at that place .
On seeing them the magnificence of ancient Rome becomes very good .
Pethian : This unique ancient temple was built 27 BC .
In the middle of its huge dome is an open place of 30 feet .
Due to this place the devotees felt as if their worships are reaching directly to the gods .
Inside the temple all around the idols of gods and goddesses are built .
However , in 601 AD this temple was made church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Velabourgs is incomparable .
Therefore do not forget to see it on going to Rome .
Definitely go to the museum built here as you will lose the chance of being reflected with the best art of engraving it .
The idols built here are incomparable and such creatures seem to be as if it will be spoken now .
Here the sister of Napoleen Wall Poleen , whose marriage was done in the royal family , a idol lying on the bridge looks so alive that you will not be able to keep watching it one pill .
The main attraction of Rome is in its fountains .
There are about 300 buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trivi Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come again in Rome then it should be put in a coin fountain with this Delhi wish .
It is believed that by doing this this desire definitely gets fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be completed till you do not see ' Veternity ' .
From the sixth century this place has been the residence of the most religious religious perspective of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although this is in Rome itself , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .

If you see in today 's history then the cheapest rate for Maldives is Rs . 28 thousand per person .
After this if you stay in Mala then even then you can get hotels in a little less rent but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives goes to any island nearby then pocket will become small .
Cycrose proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Laui Cruise started the Eklata Secruise of India for Maldives and Colombo from Kochi .

That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else should be done .
Tea snacks , food are included in the rent of cruise .
Entertainment of every time together .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from Seplending to Underwater Lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a saplin stands in front of you then you will feel like playing .
But this tune overplane with 12 - 15 seats is excellent for touring archipeligo like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air while running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not imagine the flight of common airplanes .
Every time your visions keep shining with windows - blue water of different sheds of Maldives , resort islands and Kerala islands .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two seaplane companies in Maldives .
Transmall goddess is one of them , with which there are 20 saplenes .
If you want you can roam around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person for an hour -RRB- or the whole saplene can be rented for the entertainment of your whole day -LRB- provided pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from Male Island then the journey of tourists will be necessary because this is the means of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey whose end will probably never do you .
Sepline travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- excellent Mavelivaro -RRB- in Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and shuvenire shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Male .
All the Cellsmans were listening to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nazad in Copenhagen a day before in Amman Bray World Mexa with great care .
With honesty I have not seen any Indian listening to the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is only a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land , then such a seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the sitting inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives in October , but going to Maldives it feels that if the natural disaster snatchs it from us then how poor will the world become .
In the beauty there this is something special .
In this small country such beauty does not gain .
To go back to its cruise from this tour of the market , when the eyes suddenly went in the water of the sea walking along the road then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty to what extent .
The water was so clear that the fishes swimming in a depth of several metres below the light of lempost were visible with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely attached to the city .
If you can see a few centimetres clean in the water of the sea or river adjoining any city of India then you will be able to get lucky .
While returning to M . . . Marine were roaming in mind for two hours in the evening spent in Mala .
Coral Rif -LRB- Monga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones attached to the tombs you will get Monga rocks .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nashad we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were not a security worker far and wide ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country .
With fun we were pulling the footsteps of gardens and exports only 50 metres away by increasing our hands inside the door of its bungalow .
Can you think this about the house of any modern leader of India
It was also known that the president sometimes reaches his office two blocks ahead while crossing the road on foot .
Everything about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day very carelessly .
Allahabad was that day was going to be special .
A boat brought us to the airport Island from morning cruise .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the round of Ranway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the seaplane passing through the top .
So many pictures which were seen , of it .
But then it was not supposed that the next day you would get the opportunity to ride in it .
We were going to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the Sepline of Transmall Diu .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and Kerala islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the seaplanes flying till a height of about one thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight that stopped breathing with romantic and emotion .
But on reaching the Connaught Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
It was not like this that it was difficult to get out the beauty like there .
Tour on Konrad can also be done on foot or from a battery-driven vehicle .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to special island was unique .
We could not even handle ourselves with the nature of the surroundings , that we had reached such a place , there was an unimaginable idea .
While descending several metres below the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides crossing the glasses we could see a unique kind of small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving man .
The idea of eating sitting on decorated tables there was very surprising in itself .
The fare of seeing it and lunching underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for one person coming to this island in Seplein from Mala .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But we knew that it was not possible .
We returned with this hope with heavy mind that at some point we will definitely come here .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
If you had a fond of wildlife since childhood then why not think that time jim carpet should be gone .
In Ladakh in 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking from Khardunugla Pass to Taggong lake ahead .
On the morning of 27 December we departed from Delhi to Jim Corbett , but the excitement that we had come out of humility , the humility roamed our speed .
The journey between Hapad and Gajrola was really tired .
Crossed road from Upper to Kara and in front .
Many times it felt that we fell now .
Somehow reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Welcome we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikli near the park , whose booking we had done earlier .
That day there was no special program , despite being cold we went to roam on the banks of Kosi first .
After spending two - three hours we went out of Corbett Museum , which was near Dhangdi Gate 2 kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went to roam around Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening while returning .
If you want to see a lion roaming open in the jungle then you will definitely see me in dreams all night .
Suddenly amidst the depths of the night I heard a lot of shout and after that the dogs who started shouting then did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first the advice of roaming Kala Dhangi and Corbett Fall came .
Kaladhangi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kala Dhangi , where some important things related to his life are kept .
Returning we went to 12 and a half o'clock .
Kala Dhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled by coming to this village .
On reaching the resort the safari was organising our jeepsy .
It has been told that he has arranged siteing in number one site Bajrani there .
On asking about number one told that there is more Grassland and Tigers come towards him to escape from cold during this time .
Just as we reached Bajrani a guide was given which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we pushed two elephants , whose long teeth were .
I collected photography .
This beach guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , out of which Kutch has died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but the tiger was unable to see .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a fountain ride of the tiger .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I gave him such a phone .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He did not see the tiger asked .
These words of this were snatched like a wire .
I said gradually , not .
There was no permission to take a baboon in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside.
