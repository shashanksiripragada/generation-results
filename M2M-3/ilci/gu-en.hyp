Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch Sind and on the other side Gujarat is therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
As such it is ' Boli ' it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then one has to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquake has occurred many times and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we come from the same path from which we had come then we will have to take a full month 's holiday more and on this side schools will open in Mumbai .
So what to do . Now we will travel in the railways by commuting fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and will reach Mumbai a big train of broad gauge from Ahmedabad .
Considering the main base of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism industry is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the global slowdown and increasing terror danger in South Asia tourism business has taken a big blow .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan being included in the major states of the country has been recorded a lot in these days .
The latest figures published recently by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics the number of native tourists has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included while during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and ten lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried due to this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Hollyday Makers of Rajputa says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have completely affected the tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop ourselves a strong basic framework of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism recent years have been better for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , havelis , fort , vavava forest are all old to serve the tourists .
In the tourism sector the government does the work of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very less .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the incidents of revolt and torture have also made the image of this royal at the international level .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state several years ago but it has remained accumulated only till papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of encouraging tourism and developing the basic structure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1987 .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , transportation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train palace on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has also worsened for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the deficiency of RTDC remained 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent rooms of their hotels have not been found .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big mistake .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This could not be the attraction of tourists towards railways .
Even after reducing the fare they could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years a deficiency has been seen in the interest of the tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair this year this number decreased to 217 .
Among all these the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there is no dearth in the attraction of the tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC had a profit of Rs . 9 . crore from this railway .
It is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector due to this deficiency situated in the area of tourism in Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of the person then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by settling modern city Amboveli in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream that he had seen , he shines happiness in his eyes by seeing them progressing day by day .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place in the form of a good city .
Spread over 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been set up only on 9 percent land in this city .
91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city built only for crores of couples and today around 800 families live in this city .
Initially industrialists and Amiro bought their residence here in the form of Hollyday Home now they have made their first house and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambay Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Leekawali in western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the excavation of idols of lotus and goddesses has been obtained which are mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very area .
At this place a Dashabhuja statue of Goddess Durga is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are popular among the residents here .
The ruins of Deval water are still singing the pride of Arunachal .
The temple of Tameshwari Devi found in these remains is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the month of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
The time of Chetia kings in the north eastern hills this goddess was believed to be far and wide .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifices of humans were also offered here which was later shut by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the geographical part between the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular stories here this place is Vidarbha , where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Degru , Mishmi etc . tribes here give guidance to the travellers .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith in this pond .
Famous Parashuram Kund is near Brahmakund itself .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far and wide come here .
Apart from the above ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roeing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roeing are still telling their story .
Being surrounded by pucca fort and ruins of wide roads from all sides of bathing valleys , stairs and other ponds are still singing the silence of their ancient magnificence .
From Upper Assam city North Lakhimpur we reach ero for four hours by jeep .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the heart of the visitors .
This is the same charming place where you live .
Before making the road of jeep it used to take several days to reach here .
On reaching here the views of high - tall cedar trees , beautiful premarose , wallets , wild curtains , strawberry and rosary enjoy the visitors .
Apple and potato are produced here a lot .
At a height of about 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of its people .
With its untiring hard work the people of their own have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this layer is a living example of their hard work and the efficiency of cultivation .
The necessity of its irrigation is fulfilled by the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the sky standing in the sky in the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the cold felt in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of waste - waste below the legs a skull of snow laden on the surface of wood is seen .
The atmosphere shines and nothing was seen much because of the blurredness of the sunrise before sunrise .
The sight becomes stable on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on a plate lying in the sky .
On applying hands the smooth pot of the light gets stuck with the sound of common rubber and the hands get separated from the shock with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village situated in the middle of these hills buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third tour in Swiss .
Before this we spent a lot of time living or around it .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and the dense population settled in the valley is spread very high on normal slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The equivalent highway of the Ron river and the cars running on it are clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kilometres away and two and a half hours from the car is halfway then along with the equivalent of Geneva lake and half Ron river along with the Ron river coming from eastern direction Geneva lake near the city named Montro which is called Lock Larman in French .
Geneva city is situated on the western part of this lake 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves ahead towards the west .
On the left side there are Dhawal , skyscraping Alps mountain ranges across the lake .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we leave this highway on the hilly road of the north by leaving the export of the right side .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southward the sun is giving full sunshine to all the corners of the afternoon .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not like .
As we move towards height the density of snow starts increasing .
Despite being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clear sky and shining sun .
After completing the journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular mountainous road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thel .
Chalet is a slope with roofs , completely large multi-storey bungalows made of wood .
There are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , dhobighat along with parking of cars in Bhoyra built with cement concrete of three storied bungalows .
Walay is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of making wine grape .
37  of the whole cantonment grapes are cultivated on the terrain .
In the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes provide a unique area to the beauty there .
Take the grapes to the garden , roaming there , taking night rest in the villages there and taking alcohol to the factory is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small village named Age in a fort built in 12th century there is a very big museum of wine of grapes , to see which foreign tourists have to register before .
Once again we come out from the middle of the same jungle having been descended from Dawanal .
For three - four kilometres on the whole road the mind gets very upset with the questions happening to the children .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come from the scene on one turn .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on a flat slope from above the village .
From the slope of skiing till the peak of the mountain the dense forest of deodar is located .
Great snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the population are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Peace is spread here also .
From the peaks of the mountains all around to the valley the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round circle in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Luckerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants for staying in Shaila 1500 .
65 sources of hot water have been found in Luckerabad till now .
40 lakh litres hot -LRB- up to 51o C -RRB- coming out of these water is brought to thermal bridges around the small and big 30 built at places in the entire town , some bridges are inside five star hotels and others are according to the pockets of people of different income classes .
On reaching the village one feels full heat .
In the blooming heat a large layer of snow is shining above the roof of the houses .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one among the ' preserved ' places in the form of ' national importance heritage ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that only taxis of Sikkim can go to Sikkim hence check is not done .
The journey is on , the region is another , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the swimming winds are the same .
The moisture thundering on the whole body is the same .
In the rainy season blue colored light is the same .
As soon as the plan for the journey of Darjeeling was finished , the decision to see the carsyang was decided first .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dump forests .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning only tea gardens welcome the coming towards themselves .
Passing through the road in the middle of tea gardens hypnotise the heart for the first time .
On one side the green mountain filled with forests , on the other side deep green valley .
On this side sometimes the jungle and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I fell unconscious , see these natural jungles that the plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle was , the more beautiful the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we look at the roads then the creation looks magnificent .
The curved and circular path of snake walk was passing .
The time was also passing .
If we did not pass , then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes small populations were seen .
From a distance itself a hilly house - house etc . started looking very dense .
This was Karsyang .
Staying at one place here we made a program to roam all day .
Therefore we got out on a tour of Karsiang taking a car .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach up to the deer park climbing from above i . . the car had to be left very low .
Despite being amazed with the beauty of Karsiang it could not be developed - famous as a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
In spite of the road being deserted the joy of climbing the road between the lush trees and the lush trees of deer park surrounded by jungles was giving us courage .
The next place was Eggle Crag .
On the other side of this city is a point situated at a height .
It is also called suside point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
Now , it is contiguous with a park and restaurant .
There is a stairy dome here from the height of which a beautiful view is present by observing the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were ready to break tea leaves carrying hands with a topli on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsiag city on which we could not go there that day because it seemed very important to tour the free environment of this garden .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in each other , but there was a greater concern that if there was rains like this then how would we roam around
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the blooming sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place charming with wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
Going a little more below from here we got Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls amidst wide rocks from here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls in the empire of stones and wide rocks here are spectacular then the Maavi world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is divided into stones .
Both of these places are situated very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling ascending up with the help of the car .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was clean till now .
But where we moved towards the monastery , the decreasing as if we were present and started shining .
In the evening there was an arrangement of touring and shopping on mall road .
Toy train increases the joy of journey in Darjeeling tour .
The journey of toy train from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here a little rest in boating and gardens in Mirik lake .
From this very route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters etc of Nepalese artisans are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its form - color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens , but the movement of jungles and waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winters , but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not from abroad nor from outside Rajasthan , but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come stretching .
The place which I am going to talk is just ready about four and a half years ago , but the preparations with which this place is situated there have really made it humble in the jungle .
Not only for people going there but also for those living there .
In my ears the words of my guide Ram Babu Meena echoes , sahiba before that we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work even in heritage hotels .
Rambabu residents of Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur this time and now in this unique royal style of Amman Bagh .
He had shook himself to speak in a new color .
The estimation of ' Sahiba ' is the Amman Bagh .
There no one speaks to you from English speech .
Amman Bagh is really a tour of peace and all the pleasant facilities .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the surrounding areas as well .
Some of the holidays spent in the royal style of Rajasthan must have travelled to Bhangarh of Bhuta . Why away , some of the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Amman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there from Taluka but I could not go .
It is different that he had forgotten the way and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly when I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guest then I felt that those people who want to spend a magnificent holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in the nineteenth century .
Its old wall is a witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Amman Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees hypnotise you .
The way you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it seems that attention has been given to divine peace here .
Along with binding Mauli in Kanda the mantra of Manglachar is made alive .
We had reached in the evening and we thought of hitting a round in front of that garden .
My guests who have been decorating , suddenly got up and said , ' This is a fascinating heart ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic  No wonder that Amman Bagh has also got the award recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all the journey on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spread gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For this such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep attention .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The method of calling Amman Bagh Avajo was traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they farewell to us .
Now it has been understood why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show tribal life .
Is this right
Of course and this happens not only in many states but tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Eating etc . are also included in it .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not been affected on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this , places worth seeing for ancient tourists etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given to serving traditional cuisine .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists experience the way of living and traditions of that place .
Although it seems slightly difficult to think , but such a tour is really interesting and makes a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this despite being with many people you can enjoy touring alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to play without your choice book .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving a lot of time from less cost and peace travel definitely keeps the demand for your patience .
This is the reason that to follow it some things have to be taken care of , especially at that time , some foreign places are going with the help of bus tourism .
Check a good package before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of Laxkar , children etc . get a discount on it , then there is a arrangement of relaxation for two people also .
Otherwise , buying tickets from before is cheap , therefore in the last moments instead of fixing a bus journey it is better that plan a little ahead .
Get information about cycling journey without ticket on both sides .
It becomes cheap .
The rules for the luggage are specially hard , hence ask about the height and weight of the luggage .
It does not happen anywhere that you have to leave your luggage at the station or have to pay more fees .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tour company .
The bags to keep with them are right , walk with them .
Because it comes properly in the horse above the seat .
It should also be kept in mind that while changing bus during tour the responsibility of goods will be your own .
From where you have to catch the bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the coming season you take special care of this thing .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat you will have .
Keep in mind the convenience while fixing the seat .
If you feel a lot of shock on the last seat then reading on the seats ahead will not be right .
If you have to go to urine again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more troubled then a window seat will be appropriate for you .
Now the point of a walker .
If you are in the fray of two seats then first sit on a corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while deciding the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity with the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat because the buses do not take responsibility for its loss .
Wherever the bus stops , come back while returning .
If you do not come in time , then some new characters can get your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if Rome has not been seen in Europe then nothing has been seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its items .
The capital of Italy Rome is among those ancient cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its mark is seen on western lifestyle .
Rome situated on the Taibar river is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion , because the main residence of this religion ' Pope ' is in Rome itself .
Ancient Rome was situated on seven hills .
In the fourth century on its four sides a wall , cervical wall was built .
Its ruins can be seen around Rome even today .
Rome is famous worldwide for ancient buildings and their ruins .

Along with the memorial not only of Rome but also the famous and grand chowk of Italy is Piazza Venegia .
Built in the middle of Rome this Chowk is famous as Vijay Chowk of Delhi .

Keep in mind that this road is the main road of Rome .
This second building is built on ' Capeline Hill ' and is situated at a great height .
Famous artist Michael Angelo had built the stairs of climbing on it in 1536 .
In front of Capeline there is a idol of brass of Emperor Marcus Orelias in the morning on horse , who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 .
This magnificent statue will surprise you .

A church , museum and ancient temple is also built in Capitoline Complex .
The symbol of Rome is colosium .
This huge academy was built in 80 AD and 50 thousand audiences could sit together here .
Gladiator i . . silver markets used to show their art in the colonium .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These trembling battles of heart , whether with other swords or animals , continued till the time one of the fighters died .
There were many ' Forum ' in ancient Rome .
Let me tell you that light mixing places are called forum in Rome .
All the social , religious , economic , political etc activities of the city used to take place here .

Pathian : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is an open place of 30 feet between its huge dome .
Due to this place devotees get such a feeling as if their prayers are reaching directly to the gods .
The statues of gods and goddesses are built all around inside the temple .
However , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Borgis is unmatched .
Therefore do not forget to see it while going to Rome .
Definitely go to the museum built here also , because by leaving it you will lose the chance of getting ready with excellent sculpture .
The statues built here are unique and it looks so alive as if they will start speaking just now .
Here Napoleon ' s first sister Paulin , whose marriage was done in the Borgis royal family , a statue lying on its bed looks so alive that you will be able to stay alone for some moments without seeing .
The special attraction of Rome is their fountain .
There are about 300 such buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Tevi Fountain ' .
It is believed that if you want to come to Rome again then you should put one coin in the fountain with this wish .
It is believed that by doing this this desire definitely fulfils .
The journey of this ancient city will not be completed till you do not see ' Vatican City ' .
Since the sixth century this place has been the residence of the best religious chief ' Pope ' of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome only , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
Definitely see the famous St . Peter Church of Vatican City , St . Peter Squaper , Fountain , Museum etc .
Of course you will show the view of a different world and you will always get an experience to remember .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is full of its beautiful sea shores and various water sports which is like a heaven for the tourists where from the tour of ancient churches the grandeur of ancient times is easily seen .
The ginger hotel situated in Goa 's capital Panaji makes this journey of the western shore excellent .
Ginger Hotel situated here is an excellent option for cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and enjoying comfortable day passing through the world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa .
If you see in today 's date then the fare of returning to Maldives from Delhi to the cheapest person is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Male even then hotels can be found in less fare but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives go to any island nearby then the pocket will fall small .
C cream proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis cruise from Kochi started the only C cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very interested in cruise and hotel business .
Though due to some problems the Lui Cruise has just postponed its services , but there is a possibility of its recurrence from October .
You can go on a tour of Maldives for a three day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per night on the ship MV Ekwamerin of Louis Cruise .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else should be needed .
Tea - breakfast , food are included in the rent of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching Rajdhani Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pockets - from C plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a C plane stands in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But with 12 - 15 seats this tower plane is excellent for touring the island group like Maldives .
When it flies in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of normal airplanes .
Every time your eyesight remains strong below the window , watching resort islands and coral islands in blue water of different spectacles of Maldives .
Everything looks clear .
There are only two C plane companies in Maldives .
Trass Maldives is one of them which has C plane .
If you want then you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- person per person -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire C plane on rent for your day long tour . -LRB- actually the pocket is big -RRB- .
If you go to any island before Male Island then the journey of C plane will be necessary because this is the only way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which perhaps you will never mind to be completed .
C plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- best Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the oldest and memorable shop of the capital in the Ahmad Bazar of Malena .
All the sellers were listening to the speech given by President Mohammad Nasid of Maldives a day ago in Copenhagen at the World Climate Convention .
To say honesty I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the Presidents or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when this is a question of the existence of an excellent creation of the earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the tuchs of the meeting held inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but going to Maldives it feels that if the anger of nature snatchs it from us then how much will the world become rich .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In this small country it seems as if this beauty does not end up .
After returning from that tour of the market towards Jetty to go back to its cruise when the eyes went to the water of the sea walking along the unnecessary road then it was felt that the people here understand the value of this beauty to how much extent .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in depth of several metres below the light of the lamppost was seen with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see a few centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself to be naked .
Returning to M . . Aquamorin two hours in the evening spent in Male were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- stones of barley -RRB- is the life here .
Even on stones attached to tombs you will also get stones of barley .
Some time before listening to the speech of President Nasid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security worker till far and wide .
With fun we were taking photographs of gardens and gardens around 50 metres away spreading hands inside the gate of their bungalows .
Can you think this about the house of a common leader in India
It was also found that the President reached his office sometimes two blocks ahead crossing the road on foot .
Everything about Maldives was amazing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day with authority .
It was known that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to the airport Island .
From there we reached the bus of Trans Maldives by cutting the round of the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the C plane passing through the top .
He had seen so many photographs
But then it was not known that on the next day there would be a chance of riding in it .
From the C plane of Tras Maldives we had to go to Rangali Island 150 kilometres away .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying till a height of about thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight that stopped breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konrad resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island we felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
The relationship was not in such a way that it was difficult to get out the beauty or luxury like there .
Tour on Konrad can also be done on foot or by a battery-driven car .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetti to the main island was amazing .
Now we could not even hear ourselves easily from the nature of the surroundings , that we had reached such a place , was unimaginable .
After descending at sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a meal segment .
On all the sides we could see unique types of small fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of food sitting on the decorated table there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of visiting this island in Malethi C plane and lunching underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for one person .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to swept in the water of our perva .
But we knew that it was not possible .
Returning with that desire with heavy mind , then sometimes , on some turn , Nashib will definitely be brought here .
They were planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood there was a hobby of wildlife then we thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla in Ladakh this was another like tour .
We left for Jim Corbett from Delhi on the afternoon of 27 December , but the smoke which had come out of force smoked our speed .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tired .
Dhummas from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
After doing anything we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
Although we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already done .
On that day there was some special program or we came to tour the banks of Kosi even after being cold .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult 2 kilometres away near Dhangadi gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening while returning .
We had decided from Delhi that if we see lions roaming open in the jungle then I would see tigers all night in dreams .
Suddenly in the midnight of deep night I got a strong roar and after that the dogs who started singing then they would not stop for two hours .
Therefore earlier there was a suggestion of touring Kaladhungi and Corbett Falls .
Kaladhungi is 30 kilometres away , while Corbett waterfalls come on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to his life are kept .
We got twelve and a half hours on coming .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was coming to this very village .
On reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It has been told that they have arranged siteing in number one side Bijrani there .
On asking about number one it was said that the grassy land is more there and during this time tigers come towards this itself to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam for four hours .
We went inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , whose teeth were long .
I photographed properly .
In the middle of it the guide started pursuing the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws but I was sad because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the ghost of tiger was morning .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I made him the same phone .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
Its words became like a wire .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a safari for inside .
